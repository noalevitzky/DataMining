https://www.ted.com/talks/romaine_seguin_when_goods_cross_borders_armies_stay_home,"When goods cross borders, armies stay home","Can we use trade to fight terrorism? Romaine Seguin believes that when communities are isolated from the global economy, they risk becoming breeding grounds for terrorist groups -- and trade may be a way to ward off this isolation. Seguin illuminates home grown global businesses, like the Haiti-based Deux Mains, which can provide the jobs and security that are the most impactful tools of humanitarian aid.",00:11:03,11.05,14186,2018-05-07T21:32:57+00:00,"['global issues', 'poverty', 'finance']","['English', 'Español', 'Português brasileiro']",Romaine Seguin,International trade expert,"{'00:08': 'Two years ago, in a small village in Nigeria, men with AK-47s stormed Chibok Government Secondary School. Men from the extremist group, Boko Haram, kidnapped 276 young, innocent schoolgirls. Today, 218 are still missing.', '00:34': 'I worked in and out of Nigeria for three years starting in 2007, and I remember seeing the kids going to school along dirt roads. They had smiles, they were polite, they were dressed neatly. They often talked about the books they were reading. That was tough on the kids, but they went to school for a safe place. They went to school for dreams of a better future.', '01:04': ""But turning those dreams into reality in Nigeria is difficult, because 61% of the people live at poverty level. Compare that to the US at 15%. The annual income is slightly below $6,000; compare that to the US, of $56,000. Now you see the problem. But I wasn't there in Nigeria trying to resolve an income disparity. I wasn't there trying to volunteer for a charity, or to set up a nonprofit organization. I was there to promote trade where it's very limited."", '01:48': 'I strongly believe when communities are isolated from the global economy, they could become the breeding grounds of groups like Boko Haram. Just the definition of ""Boko Haram"" stands for: ""Western education is forbidden."" That isolation in itself is dangerous. I ask you one question: Would those girls still be in school in Chibok if the conditions were different that gave rise to Boko Haram? You know, you have to wonder, what if Nigerian people had access to gain full employment? Or villages like Chibok were more integrated in the global economy? Or families could break that poverty cycle through jobs and education?', '02:40': ""Trade is a powerful weapon. Trade can fight against poverty and injustice. Trade is the gun to combat human trafficking. Trade provides medicine to the sick. Trade provides a roof for people in need of shelter. Trade is the answer to give dignity back to millions of unprivileged people. Trade is a humanitarian's strongest weapon."", '03:11': 'I work for a company that facilitates trade in 220 countries, and I\'ve personally assisted trade in 46 of them. I\'ve seen trade in action. I see trade work. But you don\'t have to take my word for it: economists have been studying it for years. In his book ""The World Is Flat,"" Tom Friedman said when countries trade with each other, they\'re the same supply chain, and they don\'t inflict military damage on each other. But Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945, said it best: ""When goods do not cross borders, armies do.""', '03:58': 'So what is this magical weapon I call ""trade""? It\'s simple: I have something you want, you have something I need. We make an exchange. But the question is: How can something so simple have such a dramatic impact on poverty and security?', '04:21': ""Let's start with poverty. There's no better example than China. Before China adopted economic reform 37 years ago, it maintained policies to keep the country poor. Then in 1979, it implemented economic reform. It allowed international trade and foreign investment. And we all know what happened -- China's the fastest-growing economy. But here's something: In that nation, in 1990, the annual income was only $980. Fast-forward to 2015, it's a little over $14,000. The poverty levels decreased [from] 84% from 1980 to 10% in 2013. The unemployment rate is at 4.1%, slightly below 4.9% of that in the US."", '05:19': 'Let\'s talk security. I started traveling in Colombia in 2010, and people were saying, ""Are you scared? Are you nervous?"" And that\'s because, 10 to 15 years earlier, the drug lords and the drug cartel would kidnap and torture people. But then the government pumped in economic resources, and they stabilized their political platform. That made a huge difference. I feel very safe going to Colombia, seeing customers.', '05:48': ""In fact, I just got back from Bogotá last week. Colombia thanks trade for improved security, reduction of poverty, and a very attractive image to the world. And I have a beautiful example of that. Colombia exported $1.3 billion of roses and flowers in 2013, with 75% coming to the US. So you see, trade clearly is a powerful weapon to fight poverty and crime. But it doesn't stop there."", '06:25': 'If I was to say ""Haiti,"" what would pop into your mind? Earthquake, hunger, poverty. Would anyone think of fashion? In 2010, the earthquake killed 230,000 Haitians, and displaced 1.5 million. Julie Colombino from Orlando, Florida went there to help. She saw humanitarian aid pour in, but she knew it wasn\'t sustainable. She started a nonprofit company called ""REBUILD globally,"" and this nonprofit taught Haitians how to make sandals out of old tires, which are very abundant there.', '07:10': ""From that nonprofit company, spun Deux Mains, a profit company, and that caught the eye of Kenneth Cole. Haiti has something the fashion world needs. They have great designs, they have top-quality craftsmanship, they have eco-friendly products. Kenneth Cole has the global brand and the distribution model to give Deux Mains shoes to the world. Trade, pure and simple. Deux Mains has made more than 2,400 pairs of sandals for Kenneth Cole, and now is in negotiation with Ron Jon, another global brand. These sandals I have on today? Yes, they've got the old tires on the bottom of them. But my purchase was made to help Haiti out of poverty. My $70 I paid wasn't a charitable contribution, it wasn't a handout. It was basic economics. It was trade at work."", '08:10': ""Julie Colombino shared with me that for every 250 pairs of shoes produced, one more Haitian is employed. So that got me thinking. In the United States, each of us buys seven and a half pairs of shoes a year. That's 2.4 billion pairs of shoes. Now just think: If one-tenth of 1% was produced in Deux Mains, that would be 2.4 million pairs of shoes. But more importantly, it would pump $120 million into the Haitian economy, and give almost 10,000 people a job. That type of employment in Haiti would have a ripple effect. And as workshop supervisor Jolina Auguste told me, the more sandals they sell, the less thieves on the street."", '09:06': ""So you see, when people have a job, security, money, they don't take other people's stuff. They don't resort to crime to survive. They don't get caught up with the drug lords like in Colombia, or terrorism that teaches them how to use AK-47s. The Global Terrorist Index report in 2015 said economic conditions play a very important part in one's decision to pursue violent extremism. The report also says Boko Haram is the most deadly terrorist organization in the world. And it recruits from the most economically marginalized regions in Nigeria."", '09:52': ""But on the other hand, if there is industrial growth, there's less domestic and international terrorism. According to a 2015 study that was published in the Oxford Economic Papers, when industrial growth increases by 1%, domestic terrorism decreases by 1%. So what does that mean? When communities gain access to the global economy through trade, they reap so many benefits."", '10:28': 'I stand here and ask you one last question: If Chibok were more connected through trade, and those young men who joined Boko Haram had an option to get a job in the formal economy, would those girls still be in school? I think so. Trade would have given them a weapon to fight terrorism. Trade would have given them hope.', '10:57': 'Thank you.', '10:58': '(Applause)'}"

Everything from disruptive metabolic changes to loss of muscle mass. In this talk, Víctor Demaría Pesce, a researcher at the European Astronaut Centre, explains how he and others in the field are pushing the envelope on physiological adaptability to ensure that humans can safely travel or even live in space.",,,14106,2019-03-26T15:33:35+00:00,"['health', 'exploration', 'human body', 'space', 'medical research']","['English', 'Español', 'Português de Portugal']",Víctor Demaría Pesce,"Doctor, dedicated to scientific research at the European Space Agency","{'0:00': 'Do you remember when we were children, when the adults without fail, to show us they were interested in us, they would ask us the question: ""And you, what do you want to be when you grow up?"" And in general, we said whatever came to our heads. I wanted to be an astronaut. But that didn\'t work out. I ended up becoming a doctor, a neurologist and a researcher. And the question I always asked myself: What are the limits of human adaptation to extreme environments such as high or low temperatures, high heights, extreme depth, even outer space? As you can imagine, I don\'t have any patients, because you need to be in great health to be able to face such an extreme environment. This theme, became the research focus that I have followed throughout my whole career in science. My work place? The European Astronaut Centre of the European Space Agency. Who are my patients? The team of European astronauts. By the way, do you know that there are astronauts in space right now? Yes or no? Yes! Since 2001, there has been a permanent presence of humans in space. Six astronauts from various nationalities spend six months in the International Space Station. Every six months, there are three that come down and three that go up. The last three actually just arrived yesterday to the ISS station. The ISS, or what we call it, the International Space Station, is a grand scientific laboratory. It it right here, in a ""suburb"" of the Earth. It\'s is flying at 400 kilometers away at a velocity of 17,400 mph. The astronauts go 16 times around the Earth in 24 hours. At this velocity, instead of in 14 hours, tomorrow I could go home to my house in Paris in 24 minutes. It would be awesome! (Laughter) The astronauts -- Who are the astronauts? They are professionals, high level technicians. They are experimenters, because they perform the scientific experiments that we doctors and researches design. They are also the subjects of our experiments, because we do experiments on them. The question that you will ask, of course is: if the astronauts are all healthy, why do they need a doctor? They actually do, because my work within the research, like those of my colleagues, is to enable the astronauts to overcome their fiscal physical and psychological problems so they can live and work in space. An environment for which evolution didn\'t prepare us. On the Earth there are two fundamental factors; the force of gravity that has conditioned our entire anatomy, the rotation of Earth and the way it alternates between light and darkness, that has conditioned all of our physiology. The force of gravity has conditioned our anatomy giving us our symmetrical body, more or less, our sense of balance, the skeleton, our muscle mass, all of this is conditioned by gravity and the fight against it. There is no gravity in space, so what will happen? They will have balance problems, they will have decalcification. The skeleton that\'s up there will have a loss of muscle mass. So... we have designed a series of physical exercises with very precise protocols which take into account all of the sectors of the body, so they can stay in shape. Because, in addition, the astronauts aren\'t weighed down, so they stretch, growing about one inch. And this produces pain. Short people don\'t have expectations, because when you return, you shrink -- (Laughter) So, at this moment, we are all working to ease this type of pain, creating a ""super skin suit"", that is the suit that the astronauts use here, that we tried for the first time three months ago. I was telling you about the rotation of the Earth, and the alternating day and night. When this alternation is missing, all of our physiology is affected. And, of course, that together with all of the circadian rhythms and all of the physiological variables. From the first flights to space, we learned that the astronauts didn\'t sleep well. The quantity and quality were altered. The body temperature as well. Sleep, temperature, metabolism, nutrition -- because with all of these metabolic changes that I was mentioning, nutrition is affected. Above all, the environment of the space station, with the long working hours from 8 am to 10 pm, so they can execute all of the protocols, that we give them to do. And also the constant noise of ventilation, up to 60 to 70 decibels to circulate the air. The light that isn\'t that bright. However, in 30 years of research, we have been able to improve a few of the working conditions. The simple things: a comfortable sleeping bag, which produces in space the same pleasing sensation that we feel when we go to lie down and are between the sheets. Also, the nutrition: It\'s not only to cover nutritional and metabolic needs -- because you have to be really hungry to want to eat this -- (Laughter) But also, to take well into account the psychological aspect and the taste. That\'s why the astronaut in red, Luca Parmitano, who is a friend of mine, brought to the station his Mom\'s lasagna, to share with the entire crew. That\'s a really special moment for them. And we realized that we as doctors and researchers, have made some progress. At this time, we are able to enable astronauts to live and work for a period of time in space and bring them back to Earth, all in all, in good health. I see a lot of young people in this room, that are very lucky because at this time, we are starting a new era in space exploration. I told you that the Space Station was in the suburbs. We are returning to the Moon now, on our way to Mars. Did you realize this? Only 12 men have had the luck to walk and work on the Moon for a few hours or almost three days. The highlight images that you are seeing right now, are not science fiction. Our daily work at this time, from what we are seeing is going to happen: the first construction robots will recover the lunar dust, the regolith, to build the first shelter -- starting in 2025. After the first building is done, three years after that, man will arrive. First, for a few days. And later, they will stay for a few months. This is very fast in the video -- it will take 3 months to do it. There they will have their little house. For us it is a huge challenge. We have to anticipate new training protocols so the astronauts, when they are walking on the Moon, will be ready for anything that can happen. We also have to have or engineer health monitoring systems to be able to check on them, to detect any problems, and to be able to diagnose them. And if a problem exists, we have to intervene therapeutically, without any doctor close by. That is something very important to us. And this trip to the Moon is only the first chapter, to continue on to Mars, the target. Did you know? After many years of working in the space field, at NASA and the European Space Agency, I am starting to realize with my colleges, that at this time, we are facing the same type of problems that our predecessors had, the doctors for the Apollo program. The Apollo program, in my youth, like all of my generation, we dreamed about this program. And inevitably, this project to put a man on the Moon, influenced my choice and professional path. And now this program is still relevant. It\'s because of this, above all for the young people, I want to tell you that I really hope that you can dream and that you can live by it. In this short time that I was here with you, I hope that I have passed on a little of my enthusiasm and passion. Thank you very much. (Applause)'}"

No big fishes, no fishes at all because we have fished them quicker than they reproduce.', '00:17': 'Today, I want to propose a strategy to save sea life and the idea has a lot to do with economics. In 1999, there was a little place called Cabo Pulmo in Baja California, in Mexico which was an underwater desert. Fishermen were frustrated by not having enough fishing. So, they decided to do something nobody expected. Instead of spending more time at sea searching for the last fish, they decided to stop fishing completely. They created a national park at sea, a marine reserve.', '00:51': ""When we came back to Cabo Pulmo ten years later, this is what we saw. What had been an underwater wasteland had become a kaleidoscope of color and life. We saw it come back to its pristine state in just ten years including the return of the biggest predators such as groupers, sharks, horse mackerel... Wow! It's an extraordinary place."", '01:19': 'If you scuba dive, go to Cabo Pulmo. Those visionary fishermen are now earning more money through tourism.', '01:27': ""When we can align economic needs with conservation miracles can happen. And we have seen similar recoveries throughout the world. I spent 20 years studying human impact on the sea. But seeing with my own eyes the regeneration of places like Cabo Pulmo gave me hope, so I decided, ten years ago, to abandon my position as a university professor to dedicate my life to protecting more places at sea, like these. In the past ten years our National Geographic, Pristine Seas team have been exploring, studying, documenting the wildest places at sea and working with government to protect them. All these places are already protected, and they cover a total surface of the size of half Canada. These places are the Yellowstones and the Serengetis of the sea. They are places where you jump into the water and immediately are surrounded by sharks. And that's good, it's good! Because sharks are a sign of a healthy ecosystem. These places are time machines that show us the sea from 500 years ago, from 1,000 years ago. But they also show us how the sea of the future could be. Because the sea has an extraordinary regenerative capacity. We have seen incredible recoveries in just a few years. What we have to do is protect more endangered places so they can be wild and full of life again."", '03:01': 'So, the question is: ""Is there any way of accelerating sea protection?"" Because today just the 2 percent of the sea is protected and that\'s not enough. Studies suggest that we need to protect at least 30 percent of the sea, not just to save sea life, but ourselves, too. Because the sea gives us food, and it gives us over the half of the oxygen we breathe. It absorbs much of the carbon pollution we release into the atmosphere. We need a healthy sea to survive.', '03:33': ""So, is there a way to accelerate protecting the sea? I think there is. And one of the solutions involves looking at international waters. Coastal countries have the authority over 200 nautical miles from the coast. Everything beyond that is called international waters or the high seas, too, shown in dark blue on this map. It's two-thirds of the ocean. No country is in charge of the high seas, but everyone is. Since it's a bit like the wild west, a lot of stuff happens there, and nobody controls anything."", '04:05': 'There are two kinds of fishing, mainly, at the high seas: at the bottom and at the surface. Bottom trawling is the most destructive practice on the planet. Supertrawlers, the biggest ships on the sea, have nets so large they can hold a dozen 747 planes. Those huge nets destroy everything in their path including deep-sea coral, which lives in submarine mountains and can be thousands of years old. Surface fishing focuses mostly on species that migrate from the high seas to the coastal waters, to the water of countries, such as tunas and sharks. Many of those are endangered species because they have been fished too much.', '04:48': ""But who fishes them? Who fishes at the high seas? Until now, it was difficult to know it exactly. Countries have not been transparent concerning long-distance fishing. Today, however, satellite technology allows us to track ships individually. And this is a revolution. This is the first time we are presenting the data you're about to see. I'm going to show you the routes of two ships fishing throughout a year using an automatic satellite positioning system. This is a ship fishing tunas and sharks for months around the south coast of the African continent. A few months later, the ship goes to Japan to replenish supplies and a while after, it's fishing around Madagascar. This other ship is a Russian trawler that fishes cod in Russian waters and also in international waters in the North Atlantic. Thanks to Global Fishing Watch we have been able to track more than 3,600 ships from more than 20 countries that were fishing at the high seas. Global Fishing Watch uses satellite positioning and artificial intelligence to automatically detect whether a ship is fishing or navigating. Depending on the kind of moves, we also know what kind of fishing it is."", '06:10': ""So, along with a group of international colleagues, scientists and economists, we decided to investigate who is fishing at the high seas and who benefits from it. My colleague Juan Mayorga from the University of California in Santa Barbara has produced detailed maps of fishing effort. Effort means how much time and fuel it takes to fish in each point of the sea. We have maps for each country that fishes in the high seas: China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain represent almost 80 percent of the fishing effort in the high seas. When we join all the countries, this is what we get: the global map of fishing effort. We know the identity of each ship on the database -- that's how we know the length of the ship, the tonnage, the engine power, how many crew members are on board... With this, we can calculate the staff cost, the fuel cost, etc. This is why, for the first time, we were able to calculate the costs of fishing on the high seas. The darker the red, the higher the cost."", '07:14': 'Colleagues from the University of British Columbia have illustrated how much each country is fishing. We also know the price of the fish when it leaves the ship. Combined with the effort data, we have been able to calculate, also for the first time, the profit, the income from fishing on the high seas. We have cost and we have income, thus, for the first time, too, we were able to calculate the profitability of fishing on the high seas, the net economic profit.', '07:46': ""I'm going to show you another map. The red color means that we are losing money by fishing in that area of the ocean. The blue color means that fishing is profitable there. There it is. It seems pretty profitable, right? But there are two important factors that we have to take into account. The first is: recent researches have revealed the use of forced labor or modern slavery on the high seas. Companies use modern slavery to reduce cost and get more profit. Secondly: each year, governments subsidize fishing on the high seas with over 4000 million dollars."", '08:28': ""Let's go back to the profits map. If we pretend that there is no slavery, that people are paid minimum wage, and deduct the government subsidies from our calculation, the map becomes this. Half of fishing on the high seas is not profitable. In fact, subsidies are four times bigger than the benefits. What this economic analysis reveals is that, practically, the entirety of fishing on the high seas makes no sense. What country, what government in its right mind would subsidize and support an industry cling to exploitation and fundamentally destructive? And it's not that profitable either."", '09:18': ""So... Why don't we close all international waters to fishing? Let's create a gigantic marine reserve on the high seas. Two thirds of the global ocean. Studies from the University of California suggest that such reserve would help the species in the high seas that migrate, such as tuna, and part of that growth in abundance would help to repopulate the coastal waters of the countries and the catch of those species would also rise, as well as the benefits, because the cost of fishing would decrease and the fish that large countries are now fishing in the wild west would be fished by the coastal countries. And well, the ecological benefits would be huge: to provide a refuge of two-thirds of the ocean for species of predators, such as tunas and sharks, which are essential to the health of the ecosystem."", '10:14': ""So, protecting the high seas, the international waters, would have ecological, economic and social benefits. But, the truth is that most fishing companies don't care about the environment. They would earn more money if they didn't fish on the high seas. Moreover, this would not affect our ability to feed our growing population, because fishing on the high seas represents only 5 percent of global marine catch since the high seas are not as productive as the coastal waters. And the high seas catch is sold as high-standing products, such as the tuna sashimi and shark fin soup. The high seas catch does not contribute to global food security."", '11:11': 'So, how are we going to do this? How are we going to protect the international waters? Right now, negotiators in the United Nations are starting discussions for a new treaty for the conservation in international waters. But this should not happen at closed doors. This is our big opportunity, and we all must ensure that our countries will support the conservation of international waters. There is a precedent. In 2016, 24 countries and the European Union agreed to protect the Ross Sea, the wildest place in the waters surrounding Antarctica, full of wildlife such as orcas, leopard seals, penguins, and those included fishing countries like China, Russia, Spain and Japan, but they decided that protecting that unique place was more beneficial than exploiting it for little profit. That is exactly the kind of international cooperation we will need. We can do it again.', '12:17': 'If in 20 years our children randomly jumped in any place of the sea, what would they see? An underwater desert, like most of our ocean today, or an abundance of life? Our legacy for the future.', '12:35': '(Applause)', '12:38': 'Thank you.', '12:39': '(Applause)'}"

This universe is overcrowded with life forms. It is invisible and intangible like the finest layer of reality, which we cannot notice. But it is there, and it maintains the functionality of our everyday world. Without it, we just wouldn\'t exist. Now, would you be surprised if I told you that actually everything I said before is true? Because I\'m about to tell you this. I\'m talking about the world of microbes - a separate world, yet so deeply connected to us. And the story of this connection expands far away into the past. But thanks to modern science, we are now able to read this story like a history book. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present biomolecular archeology, the science behind this history book. And I am here to share with you what fascinating things we can try to manage with this powerful modern science. But let\'s start with the term itself: biomolecular archeology. It\'s not even easy to pronounce, not to mention to try to understand the essence of this phrase. There might not be a problem with the archeology part, right? We\'ve all seen it in movies, we know what it is about, but what is ""biomolecular"" anyway? The first thing that comes to mind: it is something about biology and molecules. And this is actually correct. A biological molecule, or a biomolecule, is any molecule that is present in a living organism. Now, there are all sorts of molecules in your body, but undoubtedly, the most informative one is DNA. So, let\'s bring it back together. Biomolecular archeology enables us to study the DNA recovered from archeological samples. And not only native human DNA, which, of course, all by itself gives lots of study perspectives, but also the DNA of microbes that lived side by side with that human. This science is relatively young. About ten years ago, a massive breakthrough happened in genomic research technology. A method appeared which is called NGS, next generation sequencing, and this method significantly cuts time and costs of any genomic research. For example, have you ever heard about the Human Genome Project? It was quite a popular topic for science fiction some time ago. This project launched in 1990 with the goal to decrypt all genomic information in a human organism. At that time, with the technology of the time, it took ten years and three billion dollars to reach the goals of this project. With NGS, all of that can be done in just one day at the cost of 15,000 dollars. On the fertile soil of next generation sequencing arose biomolecular archeology because there is a great lot of genomic information to be analyzed and it just wouldn\'t be possible to manage such research with olden day technology. Now we are able to manage such research OK, ""But why?"" you could ask me. ""What benefits can we get out of this information? What can we use it for?"" The answer appears to be quite wide. Consider human health as a complex and dynamic system. Apart from genetically determined factors that are stored in our DNA, our health is severely influenced by many other factors, like our lifestyle, our diet, and our fellow microbes. One hundred trillion cells, one and 14 zeros, that\'s the approximate number of microorganisms in your body, ten times greater than the number of your own cells. Your microbial baggage occupies almost 2% of your body weight, that\'s about one and a half kilograms, approximately the weight of your liver. Or your brain. And all these are microbes. Just think about it for a second! Human microbiome, that\'s the modern term for all microbial communities inhabiting your body, has earned a close attention over the last decade. It seems that we are only beginning to discover the mysterious role that is given to microbes in the performance of our health. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. launched the Human Microbiome Project to finally study its relation to our health conditions. And since then, it has only become clearer that our notion about our fellow microbes is inexcusably poor. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, even compared the researchers involved in the project with the 15th century explorers discovering the outline of a new continent. It is now being suggested that a range of modern, widespread diseases, starting from obesity, Crohn\'s disease, other gastrointestinal problems to all sorts of allergies, autoimmune diseases, or maybe even cancer, may appear to be consequences of microbiome changes. But where do these changes come from? When did they first appear? What was the triggering factor? These are the questions we are trying to find answers to at the moment. This topic always triggers a memory of my first conscious experience with the microbial world around. My mother, like any attentive parent, tried her best to warn me against the invisible dangers of the world, and she told me a story that every time I do not wash hands before eating something, I become a reason of global microbial migration. (Laughter) An uncountable number of microbial families come together, pack their suitcases, their TVs, their favorite toys, and leave their houses forever to move to a new area which is thought to be my body. Now, I was a child with a very vivid imagination, and this story influenced me so much that I was obsessed with handwashing for a really long time. It actually took me years to overcome the thought that I\'m doing something wrong when I initiate this microbial migration, and to understand finally that they are actually willing to come, they\'ve got friends there waiting for them. I\'m not trying to convince you not to ever wash your hands again, of course not. But let\'s try to be moderate with it. We lack this microbial diversity nowadays. And as we know from ecology, the most diverse systems are the most stable ones. This might be one of the reasons for our so-called diseases of civilization. And this is exactly the type of hypothesis for biomolecular archeology to deal with. It turns out that there is a unique archaeological material that so preciously stores the enormous amount of information related to ancient human microbiome, and this material is ancient dental plaque, thanks to the fact that oral cavity hygiene was not on the list of top priorities for humans of the past. Their oral microbiome has already been partly fossilized during their lifetime in the form of dental calculus, which, in turn, stays in soil as well preserved as the skeletons themselves. Sadly, we can\'t help these fellas anymore. But they can help us by providing unique and precious information about their microbes and their health, and maybe we will have a chance to help others in the future thanks to them. There is one more vast human health-related aspect where biomolecular archaeology takes its rightful place, and this field of research expands into the valley of ancient deadly pathogens. It is true that the vast majority of microbes either provide us some kind of benefit or do not really care whether there is a human around. But there are some ancient deadly microbes that still remain an urgent problem nowadays all around the world. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One and a half million deaths in 2014. And OK, OK, I know, the first reaction I always get is like, ""Wait, aren\'t there antibiotics?"" or ""I heard there is even a vaccine; is this disease still dangerous to us after all?"" The answer is yes; tuberculosis is closer than you think. Because of some mysterious genetic phenomenon, there are people that can carry around this microbe their entire lives without developing any symptoms, and there are people that develop symptoms straight ahead after infection. Let me give you a real example of a tuberculosis microepidemic. Let\'s say a person somehow got infected. He works as a teacher in a junior school. Half a year later, one of his pupils develops symptoms. A few months later, the older sister of the pupil. A few more months later, two friends of the sister. This is how it spreads. When I was just starting my research on this topic, I myself was very surprised to know that tuberculosis worldwide remains one of the major health concerns, that on the list of infectious diseases,  it is the second most common death cause after HIV. Yes, the fight continues. Did you know we have a tuberculosis clinic right here in Latvia, just outside Riga, where many doctors and other specialists fight tuberculosis on a daily basis? To finally beat this harmful bacteria, it is crucial to understand how it evolved, how it developed resistance to antibiotics, how it spread. And these are the questions where biomolecular archaeology can help us a lot. At the moment, working in the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, we have managed to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one archaeological sample from the 17th century. We are now in the process of defining its whole genome, so we can understand what type of tuberculosis reigned at that time over the Latvian territories and where it came from. Obviously, biomolecular archaeology impacts humanities as well, such as history and anthropology. These, for example, are the excavations on the Saint Ģertrūdes Cemetery a few years ago. They started very spontaneously. There was an idea to build a shopping center in that area, and there was also information that there might be some medieval burial sites. So the Latvian Institute of History received a request to check it out. And they did actually find a medieval burial site, quite a massive one. Our archaeologists dug out over 500 skeletons, and found 2,000 more skeletons buried separately in a giant wooden box. But what was it? This couldn\'t be war because the skeletons lacked war lesions on their bones. Was it hunger? Epidemic? Archaeology itself cannot take this research any further, we have to intervene with biomolecular methods. Only then can we trace the true reason. The research process that implements the goals of the science is fascinating, even by itself. It all starts with ancient bones and teeth from cemeteries all around Latvia. We then cut out small pieces of these bones and shred them in special scientific mills to get bone powder. We then extract all the DNA that is captured in a specific bone powder sample, and then we sequence it. Sequencing is the process where the machine reads the DNA code and translates it into a four-letter code. By the way, it is absolutely fascinating how all genetic information of human beings and all other living creatures on the planet Earth can be written down using the alphabet containing four letters only. It\'s absolutely not surprising that the result of the sequencing is absolutely unreadable - gigabytes of text consisting of these four letters. It then takes time and effort to analyze these data with a variety of computational methods and programming approaches. And at the very end, we get a pretty readable list of all the microorganisms from a specific sample. The field of my research contains three sciences at once: archaeology, biology and computer science, all mixed, merged and connected. It\'s like the science itself merging and connecting humanity throughout centuries. Science is like a pyramid: you cannot lay the upper block without a foundation of the blocks beneath. And building this pyramid of healthcare throughout the entire human civilization, I believe biomolecular archaeology just opened up a new frontier for us. Where do we go from here? It\'s a question of choice, but I believe that any destination holds fascinating discoveries. But just for now, please remember that you are never alone. (Laughter) You\'ve got a hundred trillion friends that are always there for you. Think about it next time you want to wash your hands. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

She's six years old, and asked me for a camera to take a picture of them. It was easier for her to farewell her toys if she could take a picture before giving them away. Because she doesn't want to forget them. Because pictures help us remember. We grab our cell phones to snap when we feel something is special. When something moves us, we feel the urge to capture what we feel and keep it in an image, in a picture. However, we don't print photos on paper like we used to do, we share them in social networks, or we upload them to the cloud. Photography turned into something intangible, something virtual. But, what happens when we lose or erase our digital photos? Those in your computer, in that hard disk or in your phone. Is there anybody here who never lost a photo? What would happen if, for some reason we would lose all of our parents' photos or other loved ones who are no longer with us? How are we to remember them? Going back to our photos from the past is like opening the doors to a dimension where lots of memories we seem to forget still remain. And those images from the past, those cherished treasures can help us propel ourselves into the future, as well. I am a nighttime photographer. I make portraits under moonlight, in nature, close to the water. I ask the people I photograph to remain still and silent for several minutes amidst darkness. Meanwhile, I walk around them to light them up and light up the landscape with lanterns. It's a moment of quietness and connection. I went off to live in the islands of the Paraná River Delta for two years. I took with me an old camera without knowing very well where I was going, neither what was I to find there. And in time I came to know the islanders, and I invited them to be photographed under the full moon to recreate their daily life routines and jobs, but at night. And I took photos of loggers, hunters and dreamers. People living in isolation, whose only direct relationship is with water, to the rhythm of the river highs and lows. And that visual work in the Delta led me to travel around the world, and took me to Japan. I was searching for a new story to tell. I wanted to work again with a community which had some connection with water. And it happened that the curator of my exhibition, Ihiro Hayami, had relatives in a small fisher town and went with me for a visit. Ōtsuchi is located between the mountains and the sea. It's a fifteen-thousand-people town that in March 2011 went through the worst tragedy in its history. It was washed off by a tsunami with waves tall as a five-story building. Even though the alarms went off many people didn't believe it would be so strong, and remain in their homes. As a consequence many people died, close to a 10 percent of the population. And 70 percent of houses were washed away. This is why every local in Ōtsuchi has either friends or family who died in the tsunami. The power of the waves pulled the houses off their base and the sea gulped them up. Survivors were left with no shelter and had to endure a winter with temperatures below zero Celsius. Amidst this chaos and total destruction many people were trying to save their family photos. An officer of Japan's Self Defense Forces recovers a photo album inside a house in total ruin. There it was the picture of a child. The officer holds the album as if he were holding the child. I traveled to Ōtsuchi with my daughter who was five month old at the time. And the contrast of a baby in the middle of such desolation was impressive. People would take her off of my arms in order to kiss her. And I'd wonder how to tell this story that happened a year and a half ago. What could be positive out of such level of destruction. The first thing I found were big piles of rubble made of all kind of things. Twisted objects that speak about life as it used to be in Ōtsuchi. Like this vending machine or this fishing elements, car remains ... or what's left of a house. A lamp turned into a Moebius strip, the symbol of infinite time. As a contrast to these mountains of rubble there was this town flattened by water. The skeletons of the houses, marked on the ground were empty spaces, filled with stories. So I invited the survivors to go back to those spaces where their houses or workplaces used to exist. And many accepted, but in general, the kids didn't want to. I photographed them during the night as they remained silent and still during the ten minutes each photo took. The scenes were so sad, nothing had color. She is Haruko Okano, a librarian, and she's sitting on the remains of Ōtsuchi's Library, where she worked. This is the Second Volunteers Firefighters Squad of Ōtsuchi inside of what was the fire station. The fireman standing up was in charge of closing the anti-tsunami gates. This is Yoshihiro Ogayu, monk of Kogan-ji temple. The temple was a refuge in case of tsunami but even so it was destroyed. His dad and his son died there. When that first trip to Ōtsuchi was over I found a photo album in the middle of the street. It had laid there for a year and a half without having anyone pick it up. It was all wet, heavy and it stank just like a dead animal. It was tainted with color bubbles gushing from the photos that blended together. I took a picture of it without giving it much of a thought and I came back. Once in Buenos Aires, the Ōtsuchi experience felt much like a far away dream. It filled me up with doubt: Why did I have to tell this story, if I came from the other end of the world? What did it had to do with me? Why had I photographed the survivors in black and white if the reference of my work is color? And while I made myself these questions, my own life began to crumble. Soon after breakup, my daughter's mother went off to live in another country. So I took on myself Lara's upbringing, she was a one-year-old baby. Project Ōtsuchi was put on hold, because now it was me the one who had to survive and reinvent myself. And some months later, revisiting the work the family photo album image popped up again. But in this second view I grasped it in a different way. I thought I saw a painter's palette. So I took the main colors of that album to create my own color palette. And I used those colors created by the force of the tsunami to color the images of the survivors. And little by little, all the gray scenes turned into something colorful. I used color as a bridge to connect the present and the past, as the hub between their photos and mine. Now I was feeling connected with Ōtsuchi once again. Two years passed since until I was able to return to Japan  to search for other recovered photos and find new colors to paint with. There I met Mikio Komukai, a nice man who had this NGO that was recovering family photos to send them back to their owners. And with his help and the permission of Ōtsuchi's government I gained access to that impressive archive of thousand of destroyed photos. Contemplating those pictures I realized the intangible damage the people of Ōtsuchi were facing; the damage to their memory and identity. Those blurred images were the measure of their loss. The firefighters of Ōtsuchi. I traveled a total of six times to finish the project and publish a book. And this is the last picture I took with my two assistants, Mayumi Suzuki and Kazuhiko Chikaoka, who both lost their parents to the tsunami. We built an arch with plastic tubes which they arranged in different positions over the remains of this house. And if you look carefully at the photo you will see that their hands are holding this house of light. In 2016 the government of Ōtsuchi invited me to show my project, but I had a feeling that it was not over. There was something left to do. So I suggested that we put together a collective exhibition which we set up in the gymnasium of a temporary school. And we invited high school students and the people in town to take photos. Now the kids did want to join in. We gave them disposable cameras with one assignment: to tell their lives in pictures, their intimate whereabouts. Five years away from the tsunami there were children back in the streets taking photos, recording its life. And together, in community, we created a small photo archive of what Ōtsuchi is today. The people in town took pictures to create new memories: The memories of the future of Ōtsuchi. As for me, I started my own photo album telling my life and my travels with Lara. And here we are in Japan, saying goodbye to the sea of Ōtsuchi. Thank you very much. (Applause)""}"
