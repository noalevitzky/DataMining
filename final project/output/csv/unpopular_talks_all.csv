Ellen 't Hoen talks about an elegant, working solution to the problem: the Medicines Patent Pool.",0:11:01,11.01666667,432070,2012-12-10T16:18:24+00:00,"['TEDx', 'collaboration', 'health', 'health care', 'history', 'invention', 'medicine', 'science', 'open-source', 'medical research', 'pharmaceuticals', 'AIDS', 'disease', 'HIV', 'pandemic', 'illness', 'business', 'bioethics', 'public health', 'morality', 'society', 'social change', 'activism']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Slovenčina', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'Українська', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'ภาษาไทย', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Ellen 't Hoen,Medicine law expert,"{'00:10': 'In 2002, a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane. The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century, had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly. They also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane. They were not the only ones. That was common practice in the industry, and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right.', '00:45': ""This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry, and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government was interested in ramping up the production of military airplanes. So there was a bit of a conflict there. The U.S. government decided to take action, and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes."", '01:16': 'So what has this got to do with this?', '01:23': ""In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist, discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment. He was told that a cure did not exist. AIDS, he heard, was lethal, and treatment was not offered. This was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries. AIDS had become a chronic disease. People in our countries here in Europe, in North America, were living with HIV, healthy lives. Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough, and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later also had HIV."", '02:07': 'Nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups. In 2002, they were facing a different battle. Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV, cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year. The patents on those drugs were held by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available. When you have a patent, you can exclude anyone else from making, from producing or making low-cost versions, for example, available of those medications. Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe.', '03:03': 'Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere. There were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents, such as India, and Indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions, low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines, and make them available in the developing world, and within a year the price had come down from 10,000 dollars per patient per year to 350 dollars per patient per year, and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year, and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines. Treatment programs became possible, funding became available, and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.', '04:02': ""Today, eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs. Thirty-four million are infected with HIV. Never has this number been so high, but actually this is good news, because what it means is people stop dying. People who have access to these drugs stop dying. And there's something else. They also stop passing on the virus. This is fairly recent science that has shown that. What that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic."", '04:34': ""So what's the problem? Well, things have changed. First of all, the rules have changed. Today, all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years. This is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the World Trade Organization. So what India did is no longer possible. Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed. Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95, before antiretroviral drugs. This is what you see today, and this is in developing countries, so what that means is, unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now, we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis, because new drugs are developed, new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries. So unless we act, unless we do something today, we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed the treatment time bomb."", '05:55': ""It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented. There's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away. This shows you a patent landscape. This is the landscape of one medicine. So you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product, unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available, you will probably choose to do something else. Again, deliberate action is needed."", '06:32': 'So surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes, we should be able to do something similar to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.', '06:50': 'And we did. In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool for HIV. And this is how it works: Patent holders, inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions, but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents. That can be generic manufacturers. It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies, for example. Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them, to treatment programs that need access to them. They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders, so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.', '07:53': ""There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool. The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism. The airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they'd license their patents or not. They were forced to do so. That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do. It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use."", '08:28': 'Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy. He has access to antiretroviral drugs. His son will soon be 14 years old. Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the Medicines Patent Pool, and he told me not so long ago, ""Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us, that new medicines, without delay, become available to us.""', '09:08': ""And this is no longer fantasy. Already, I'll give you an example. In August of this year, the United States drug agency approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication. The company, Gilead, that holds the patents, has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool. The pool is already working today, two months later, with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented. This has never been done before. The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries, if at all. This has never been seen before. Nelson's expectations are very high, and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next, throughout their lifetime, so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy, active lives."", '10:19': ""Now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen. We count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest of the global good, but also in their own interest, to move from conflict to collaboration, and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen. They can also choose not to do that, but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with early last century, facing forcible measures by government. So they'd better jump now. Thank you.

""Earth""). It's a deep blue world we landlubbers rarely see in 3D.",0:11:53,11.88333333,431872,2008-11-03T01:00:00+00:00,"['business', 'design', 'exploration', 'invention', 'oceans', 'technology', 'global commons']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Hrvatski', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Graham Hawkes,Inventor,"{'00:04': 'I think the future of this planet depends on humans, not technology, and we already have the knowledge -- we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we’re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages. And when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet, ""Earth:"" it’s pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages.', '00:41': 'Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, ""It’s not flat, stupid, it’s round."" Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite -- his was, ""It’s not in the middle, you know."" And Hawkes: ""it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."" This is an ocean planet. T.S. Eliot really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps: ""we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time."" And the next lines are, ""Through the unknown remembered gate, where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning."" So I have one message. It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.', '01:37': 'For the rocketeers in the audience: I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts, I admire the courage -- but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. (Laughter) And it’s all a question of perspective. Let me try and tell you -- I don’t mean to insult you, but look, if I -- and I’m not doing this for real because it would be an insult, so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow -- I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking. If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth, and I held up another square that was the root two square -- so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans; and I said, what is the relative value of these two things? Well, it’s the relative importance. You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this; water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. But it’s a question of perception, and if that’s what you’re thinking, if that’s what you think I mean when I say, ""This is an ocean planet stupidly called \'Earth.\'"" If you think that that’s the relative importance, two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten. Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks, but you sound like it when you say ""Earth,"" because that demonstration, if I turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper. It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence. The ocean representation would have a depth to it. And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.', '03:15': 'It turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aquatic. That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. The problem we have in believing that is -- you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. Because it’s a problem we have. If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet, it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.', '03:46': 'Okay. Let me criticize this thing. I’m not talking about James Cameron -- although I could, but I won’t. You really do have to go and see his latest film, ""Aliens of the Deep."" It’s incredible. It features two of these deep rovers, and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere. This is an acryclic sphere. It generates all of the buoyancy, all of the payload for the craft, and the batteries are down here hanging underneath, exactly like a balloon. This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload. Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. And this one actually carries two great manipulators. It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for. The problem with it is -- and the reason I will never build another one like it -- is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking. It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints -- importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it -- and we take them underwater. You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat. A seat works in a two-dimensional world, where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK? And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. And then our mothers tell us, ""Careful you don’t fall down"" -- because you’ll fall over.', '05:28': 'Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet. This planet has an inner atmosphere of water; it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres -- a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence, which is alien to us. Fish do not sit in seats. (Laughter) They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish, ""Careful you don’t fall over."" They don’t fall over. They don’t fall. They live in a three-dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way, that way, that way or that way. It’s truly a three-dimensional space. And we’re only just beginning to grasp it. I don’t know of any other submersible, or even remote, that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space.', '06:29': 'This is the way we should be going into the oceans. This is a three-dimensional machine. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. OK, this is good stuff. This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater. Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray. She has twice the wingspan that I do. There I’m coming; she sees me. And just notice how she rolls under and turns; she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls. And the craft that I’m in -- this hasn’t been shown before. Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. There I am; I see her coming back, coming up underneath me. I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down. I’m trying to do everything very gently. We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me. And this ballet is controlled by this lady here. She gets about that close and then she pulls away. So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying. This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. This was a fly by wire. It has wings. There’re no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently, positively buoyant. And then by moving through the water it’s able to take that control. Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away. She just rolled right away from underneath. Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.', '08:11': 'It took 10 years to build. But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much. We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine. But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it, it’s a little bit of back pressure, and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.', '08:35': 'This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony. I don’t really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted. Now, there she goes, right overhead. This is a wide-angle camera. She’s just a few inches off the top of my head. ""Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about, oh, I don’t know, just so close."" I come back up, not for air. ""This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless. We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."" Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please. (Applause)', '09:23': 'Trying to fly and keep up with that animal -- it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had. It was the fact she was going so slow. I actually designed that to move faster through the water because I thought that was the thing that we needed to do: to move fast and get range. But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance. She wanted to dance. And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.', '09:54': 'So the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one. You see the larger wing area here. Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing, we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn\'t figure out how to do it. So we opened the world’s first flight school. The rational for the world’s first flight school goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say -- they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things, but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous -- they would come up and say, ""Do you have a license for that?"" And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beard that would all sprout out, and I would say, ""I don’t need no stinking license."" (Laughter) ""I write these stinking license,"" which I do. So Bob Gelfond\'s around here -- but somebody in the audience here has license number 20. They’re one of the first subsea aviators. So we’ve run two flight schools. Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun. What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.', '11:05': 'But the patent for underwater flight -- Karen and I, we were looking at it, some business partners wanted us to patent it -- we weren’t sure about that. We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go. It just seems wrong to try and patent -- (Applause) -- the freedom for underwater flight. So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us, go for it. The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs. We developed some other technology called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning: we’re going to be building a beautiful, little, small version of this -- unmanned, super deep -- for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. (Applause) Thank you.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some of you, it\'s pretty easy. Inside your head, you\'re like, ""It\'s one. You\'re speaking it, buddy. I\'m done."" Others of you maybe are wondering if the language an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend taught you, where you learned all the cusswords, if it counts -- go ahead and count it. When I asked myself the question, I came up with four, arguably five, if I\'ve been drinking.', '00:38': '(Laughter)', '00:39': '(In Italian: With a little bit of wine I can speak Italian.)', '00:42': '(Applause)', '00:44': 'Cheers!', '00:46': 'But on closer examination, I came up with 83 -- 83 languages, and I got tired and I stopped counting. And it forced me to revisit this definition that we have of language. The first entry said, ""The method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured or conventional way."" The definition at the bottom refers to specialized fields, like medicine, science, tech. We know they have their own vernacular, their own jargon. But what most interested me was that definition right in the center there: ""the system of communication used by a particular community or country."" And I\'m not interested in altering this definition. I\'m interested in applying it to everything we do, because I believe that we speak far more languages than we realize. And for the rest of our time together, I\'m going to attempt to speak in one language that is native to every single human being in this room.', '01:36': ""But that changes things a little bit, because then it's no longer a presentation. It becomes a conversation, and in any conversation, there must be some sort of interaction. And for any interaction to happen, there has to be a degree of willingness on both parties. And I think if we just are willing, we will see the magic that can happen with just a little bit of willingness. So I've chosen a relatively low-risk common denominator that can kind of gauge if we're all willing. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands."", '02:10': '(Claps)', '02:11': ""Now you're talking!"", '02:14': '(In Spanish: For all the people who speak Spanish, please stand up.

I simply asked the Spanish-speaking audience to stand up, look at a person that was sitting close to them and laugh. And I know that wasn't nice, and I'm sorry, but in that moment, some of us felt something. You see, we're often aware of what language does when we speak somebody's language, what it does to connect, what it does to bind. But we often forget what it does when you can't speak that language, what it does to isolate, what it does to exclude. And I want us to hold on as we journey through our little walk of languages here."", '03:10': '(In Farsi: I\'d like to translate the idea of ""taarof."") I said in Farsi, ""I\'d like to translate this idea of \'taarof\' in the Persian culture,"" which, really -- it has no equivalent in the English lexicon. The best definition would be something like an extreme grace or an extreme humility. But that doesn\'t quite get the job done. So I\'ll give you an example. If two gentlemen were walking by each other, it\'d be very common for the first one to say, (In Farsi: I am indebted to you), which means, ""I am indebted to you."" The other gentlemen would respond back, (In Farsi: I open my shirt for you) which means, ""I open my shirt for you."" The first guy would respond back, (In Farsi: I am your servant) which means, ""I am your servant."" And then the second guy would respond back to him, (In Farsi: I am the dirt beneath your feet) which literally means, ""I am the dirt beneath your feet.""', '03:56': '(Laughter)', '03:57': ""Here's an exhibit for you guys, in case you didn't get the picture."", '04:00': '(Laughter)', '04:01': ""And I share that with you, because with new languages come new concepts that didn't exist before.

Others of you, you might struggle a little bit. And I could probably draw a pretty clear-cut line right around the age of 35 and older, 35 and younger. And for those of us that are in the know, we know that\'s text-speak, or SMS language. It\'s a series of characters meant to convey the most amount of meaning with the least amount of characters, which sounds pretty similar to our definition of languages: ""system of communication used by a community."" Now, anyone who\'s ever got into an argument via text can make a case for how it\'s maybe not the best method of communication, but what if I told you that what you saw earlier was a modern-day love letter?', '05:03': 'If you follow along: ""For the time being, I love you lots, because you positively bring out all the best in me, and I laugh out loud, in other words, let\'s me know what\'s up. \'Cause you are a cutie in my opinion, and as far as I know to see you, if you\'re not seeing someone, would make happy.

It's one of the most common languages in the world. We don't have to explain it to each other, it's just something we all feel, and that's why things like laughter and things like music are so prevalent, because they seem to somehow transcend explanation and convey a profound amount of meaning."", '06:00': ""Every language we learn is a portal by which we can access another language. The more you know, the more you can speak. And it's something common that we all do. We take any new concept, and we filter it through an already existing access of reality within us. And that's why languages are so important, because they give us access to new worlds, not just people. It's not just about seeing or hearing, it's about feeling, experiencing, sharing."", '06:28': 'And despite these languages that we\'ve covered, I really don\'t think we\'ve covered one of the most profound languages, and that\'s the language of experience. That\'s why when you\'re talking with someone, if they\'ve shared something you\'ve shared, you don\'t need to explain it much. Or that\'s why, when you\'re sharing a story and you finish, and the people you\'re talking to don\'t quite get it, the first thing we all say is, ""Guess you had to be there."" I guess you had to be here this week to know what this is about. It\'s kind of hard to explain, isn\'t it?', '06:56': ""And for the sake of our research, I'm going to close by asking that you participate one more time in this language of experience. I'm going to filter through some languages, and if I'm speaking your language, I'm going to ask that you just stand and you stay standing. You don't need to ask permission, just let me know that you see me, and I can also see you if you speak this language of experience. Do you speak this language? When I was growing up in primary school, at the end of the year, we would have these parties, and we'd vote on whether we wanted to celebrate at an amusement park or a water park. And I would really hope the party wasn't at a water park, because then I'd have to be in a bathing suit. I don't know about you, but sometimes when I approach a dressing room, my sweat glands start activating on their own, because I know the garment is not going to look on me like it did on that mannequin."", '07:48': 'Or how about this? When I would go to family functions or family gatherings, every time I wanted a second plate -- and I usually did --', '07:57': '(Laughter)', '07:58': 'it was a whole exercise in cost-benefit analysis, my relatives looking at me like, ""I don\'t know. Do you really need that? Looks like you\'re doing OK there, bud."" Did my cheeks have a big ""Pinch me"" sign that I didn\'t see? And if you\'re squirming or you\'re laughing or you stood up, or you\'re beginning to stand, you\'re speaking the language that I endearingly call ""the language of growing up a fat kid."" And any body-image issue is a dialect of that language.', '08:26': 'I want you to stay standing. Again, if I\'m speaking your language, please go ahead and stand. Imagine two bills in my hand. One is the phone bill, and one is the electric bill. Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, pay one off, let the other one go, which means, ""I might not have enough to pay both at the current moment."" You\'ve got to be resourceful. You\'ve got to figure it out. And if you\'re standing, you know the language of barely making ends meet, of financial struggle. And if you\'ve been lucky enough to speak that language, you understand that there is no motivator of greatness like deficiency. Not having resources, not having looks, not having finances can often be the barren soil from which the most productive seeds are painstakingly plowed and harvested.', '09:17': 'I\'m going to ask if you speak this language. The second you recognize it, feel free to stand. When we heard the diagnosis, I thought, ""Not that word. Anything but that word. I hate that word."" And then you ask a series of questions: ""Are you sure?"" ""Has it spread?"" ""How long?"" ""Doctor, how long?"" And a series of answers determines a person\'s life. And when my dad was hungry, we\'d all rush to the dinner table to eat, because that\'s what we did before. We ate together, so we were going to continue doing that. And I didn\'t understand why we were losing this battle, because I was taught if you fight and if you have the right spirit, you\'re supposed to win. And we weren\'t winning.

And for anybody that stood up, you speak the language that I like to call ""the language of disconnection."" It\'s been called the language of connection, but I like to call it the language of disconnection. I don\'t mean disconnection, I mean disconnection, human disconnection, disconnected from each other, from where we are, from our own thoughts, so we can occupy another space.', '11:34': ""If you're not standing, you probably know what it's like to feel left out."", '11:41': '(Laughter)', '11:44': '(Applause)', '11:47': ""You probably -- you know what it's like when everybody's a part of something, and you're not. You know what it's like being the minority. And now that I'm speaking your language, I'm going to ask you to stand, since we're speaking the same language. Because I believe that language of being the minority is one of the most important languages you can ever speak in your life, because how you feel in that position of compromise will directly determine how you act in that position of power."", '12:17': ""Thank you for participating.

There's no comparison at all. In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored."", '00:28': 'And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it. A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation. 17 million people die every year from heart disease. 32 million heart attacks and strokes occur. Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa. 85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the West -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.', '01:04': ""Who is at risk? People like you. It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time, should be very concerned about this deplorable situation. Has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night, and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating? You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do? Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe? No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated."", '01:42': ""This is what's going on. In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here, 10 million people here, 10 million here. By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria -- life expectancy is 47. It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses -- they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach about 45 years old and 50 years old. And those are the times they're most productive. Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development. But they're not there. The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents. If you cannot secure the parents, you cannot guarantee the security of the African child."", '02:31': ""What are the risk factors? It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. These are just for information: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects. Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension. 20 percent are getting treated. Only less than one percent are adequately treated. If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa, we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!"", '03:02': ""Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria, which is all good. We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV. In eight short years, non-communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in Africa."", '03:22': ""That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this. This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites -- they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable. You can't depend on foreign aid alone. Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards. Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with, their own internal issues. So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems. You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility, it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems. If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation. These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them. If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions."", '04:17': ""I'm here to talk to you about solutions. This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us. Several years ago, we started thinking about it. Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are. We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is. Everyone is ready to throw in money, in terms of free money aid to developing countries. Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested. You can't raise money. I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States -- I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America. [It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures. But start telling them, you know, we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away. That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here, if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development."", '05:10': ""Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute, so you get a glimpse of what we do, and I'll talk a little bit more about it. What we have done is to show that high-quality health care, comparable to the best anywhere in the world, can be done in a developing country environment. We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained, board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain. We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt, Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. -- and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States. (Applause)"", '06:57': ""Additionally, we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay. We take care of everyone. (Applause) Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter. And I will tell you how we're able to do it."", '07:12': 'We make sure that we select our equipment properly. We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that, we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. We emphasize training, and we make sure that this process is regenerative. Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay, unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.', '07:42': ""We made sure that we produced some things ourselves. We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals. We get the generators from the companies. We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down. So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. -- that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we're finished manufacturing it in-house, we come at a price of about two dollars. (Applause)"", '08:09': ""We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology. All these problems we're talking about -- if we bring development, they will all disappear. Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work? It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective. It extends opportunity to the rural centers, and we can use expertise in a very smart way."", '08:37': ""This is the way our centers are set up. We currently have three locations in the Caribbean, and we're planning a fourth one. And we have now decided to go into Africa. We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09. And we will do other centers. This model can be adapted to every disease process. All the units, all the centers, are linked through a switched hub to a central server, and all the images are populated to review stations. And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us, and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable."", '09:26': 'We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world, just by a click of the button. I\'ll lead you through, to see how this happens. This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in. I can call you in Switzerland and say, ""Listen, go into our system. Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."" They\'ll give me that information, and we\'ll make the care of the patient better. The patient doesn\'t have to travel. He doesn\'t have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise.', '10:07': ""We also use [an] electronic medical record system. I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there. But you know, they have that luxury. Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham, two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland, you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury, so we have to make it happen. When we do it, we will put the cost of care down. And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable. And everyone will get the care they deserve."", '10:46': ""It cannot just be technology, we recognize that. Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that. But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it. They need to be alive, they need to feed. We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do. We have had walks every year -- every March, April. We form people into groups and make them go into challenges. Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes. Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer, we give them prizes. We do this constantly. We encourage them to bring children. That way we start exposing the children from very early on, on what these issues are. Because once they learn it,"", '11:40': ""they will stay with it. In doing this we have created at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone, and these are physicians with expertise and special training. We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died, including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology, complete heart block means certain death. If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead. So we are pleased with that."", '12:08': 'Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care. And we\'ve hopefully saved a lot of lives. By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months, it\'s been 340,000 dollars, averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that, because they have competing needs. They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it. People say, ""How can you do that?"" This is how we can do that. At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean. And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home, getting the same quality of care. And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. (Applause)', '13:24': ""For this to work, this progress must be sustainable. So, we emphasize training. Training is critical. We have gone further: we have formed a relationship with the University of Technology, Jamaica, where I now have an appointment. And we are starting a biomedical engineering program, so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment. That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues. We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training, it gives people motivation. Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them."", '14:17': ""(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping. I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies. I came to the Heart Institute in 2006, as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program. I spent three months at the Heart Institute. There's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here, and I think there's been an increased interest now in -- particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting."", '14:49': 'Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean, since the past two years. I received training at this institution. I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.', '15:17': ""Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained, and you can make it possible for everyone. Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care? When have you been appointed to play God? It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person, no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life. Next stop is West African Heart Institute, that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa. We will extend the same system into other areas, like dialysis treatment. And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation, we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,"", '16:13': 'and how you can do it. If we do this, we can change the face of health care in Africa. Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa. I am going. Those who want to come, I welcome you to come along with me. Thank you.

And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days, so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid, indeed, I was a conservative. I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican, a leader in the Teenage Republicans. Indeed, I was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president."", '00:36': 'Now, I know what you\'re thinking. (Laughter) You\'re thinking, ""That\'s not what the Internets say."" You\'re thinking, ""Wikipedia doesn\'t say this fact."" And indeed, this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here. Wikipedia reports that this guy, this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention, but it\'s just not true. (Laughter) Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here. (Laughter) (Applause) All right. Okay, so ... perfect. Perfect. (Laughter) Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right. Okay. Finally, truth will be brought here. Okay, see? It\'s done. It\'s almost done. Here we go. ""... Youngest Republican,"" okay, we\'re finished. That\'s it. Please save this. Great, here we go. And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally. Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.', '01:54': '(Applause)', '01:58': ""But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives -- not so much this issue of the 1980 convention -- the thing to think about is this: They go to church. Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church. I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. And I'm not talking about the God thing. I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point. They go to church, by which I mean, they do lots of things for free for each other. They hold potluck dinners. Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners. They serve food to poor people. They share, they give, they give away for free. And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who, on Sundays, show up and share. And not only food, right."", '02:48': ""These very same people are strong believers, in lots of contexts, in the limits on the markets. They are in many important places against markets. Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship. But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship, else it turns into something like this. They want to regulate us, those conservatives, to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places. Because they understand: There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist, where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. They recognize: Both of these things have to live together."", '03:35': 'And the second great thing about conservatives: they get ecology. Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt. They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources. And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation, economics. They understand, in that context, ""free."" They understand ""free"" is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well. That\'s the thing I want you to think about them.', '04:10': 'Now, I know you don\'t believe me, really, here. So here\'s exhibit number one. I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez, a libertarian who works at the, for many people, ""evil"" Cato Institute. Okay, so Julian made this video. He\'s a terrible producer of videos, but it\'s great content, so I\'m going to give you a little bit of it. So here he is beginning.', '04:36': ""Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ..."", '04:40': 'Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos. This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania. Which, of course, spread virally. Hugely successful.', '04:56': ""(Music) And then some people from Brooklyn saw it. They decided they wanted to do the same. (Music) And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it. And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well. (Music) And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this. Here's lesson number one."", '06:00': ""JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup. And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing. But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends."", '06:27': 'LL: Or ...', '06:29': ""JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here, remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement; it becomes an act of social creativity. And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art."", '07:01': 'LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...', '07:04': ""JS: One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience. Stage two, social remix, is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other. First, within each video, the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. But there's also a dialogue between the videos, where, once the basic structure is established, it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds."", '07:40': ""LL: And then, here's for me, the critical key to what Julian has to say ..."", '07:46': ""JS: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity; it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture. I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind. If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one, I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and, in some ways, maybe even more important one."", '08:20': 'LL: Right. Bingo. Point. Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture. And for that to happen, you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected, to enable this kind of innovation, as this libertarian tells us, between these two creative cultures, a commercial and a sharing culture. The point is they, he, here, gets that culture.', '08:55': 'Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much. All right, take for example this great company. In the good old days when this Republican ran that company, their greatest work was work that built on the past, right. All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them, or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them, to celebrate this add-on remix creativity. Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course, as ""Steamboat Willie,"" is a remix of the then, very dominant, very popular ""Steamboat Bill"" by Buster Keaton. This man was a remixer extraordinaire. He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity.', '09:44': 'But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat. Wildly different. This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years, so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm. Now, when we tried to challenge this, going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down, we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right-wing Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman, who said he would join our brief only if the word ""no brainer"" was in the brief somewhere. (Laughter) But apparently, no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law. Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote: Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican, but I don\'t buy it. This guy is no Republican.', '10:51': 'Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character. Look at the site that he built: ""Star Wars"" MashUps, inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon. Read the license. The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas. The mashup is owned by Lucas. Indeed, anything you add to the mashup, music you might add, Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free. There is no creator here to be recognized. The creator doesn\'t have any rights. The creator is a sharecropper in this story. And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers: the Democrats, right?', '11:43': ""So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership, a respect for ownership, the respect we should give the creator, the remixer, the owner, the property owner, the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff, and not a generation of sharecroppers. Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here, lessons about openness. Our lives are sharing activities, at least in part. Even for the head of Goldman Sachs, at least in part. And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use."", '12:28': ""That's number one. Number two: This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. Freedom, which means without permission from anyone, the ability to create. And number three: We need to respect the creator, the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons. Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit, but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the Creative Commons, which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry."", '13:12': 'So that we go from a ""all rights reserved"" world to a ""some rights reserved"" world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content, building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely. And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that\'s obviously developed around these licenses, as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there, licensed freely in this way.', '13:59': ""Now that picture of an ecology of creativity, the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity, is that the ecology of creativity we have right now? Well, as you all know, not many of us believe we do. I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week. I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given, and I uploaded it to YouTube. I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID. So I didn't think much about it."", '14:39': 'And then on Twitter, somebody said to me, ""Your talk on YouTube was DMCA\'d. Was that your purpose?"" imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA. I answered, ""No."" I didn\'t even think about it. But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. My whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video, a video about fair use, that included Warner Music Group music. Now, interestingly, they still sold ads for that music, if you played the silent video. You could still buy the music, but you couldn\'t hear anything because it had been silenced.', '15:22': 'So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use. I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions. And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way you\'ve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak. And I felt like I was in third grade again. ""I will not put tacks on the teacher\'s chair. I will not put tacks on the teacher\'s chair."" This is absurd. It is outrageous. It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging.', '16:04': ""And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it? Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech? John McCain. Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system, that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet."", '16:31': ""Now, that was the story of me then, my good old days of right-wing lunacy. Let me come back to now, now when I'm a little leftist -- I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty -- And I wonder, can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom, now, in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it, where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research? The president, who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements, which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting. Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon."", '17:44': ""So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn. Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values. We need to speak of those values. The value of freedom. It's a value of community. It's a value of the limits in regulation. It's a value respecting the creator. Now, if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right, if we can take them and incorporate them, maybe we could do a little trade. We learn those values on the Left, and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right."", '18:20': 'Anyway, please join me in teaching these values.', '18:24': 'Thank you very much.', '18:26': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country's system of psychosocial counseling, promoting both individual and, perhaps, national healing.",0:10:26,10.43333333,431054,2010-09-29T08:24:00+00:00,"['brain', 'depression', 'global issues', 'mental health', 'peace', 'poverty', 'psychology', 'violence', 'war', 'PTSD']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Hrvatski', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Čeština', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'हिन्दी', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Inge Missmahl,Analytical psychologist,"{'00:05': 'So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story -- about addressing desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan, and what we have learned from it, and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead -- in the future -- and how to participate again in everyday life. So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst, and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance, on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 70 percent of the people are illiterate. War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. You may know this from the media, but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old, which means they grow up in such an environment and -- I repeat myself -- in 30 years of war.', '01:08': 'So this translates into ongoing violence, foreign interests, bribery, drugs, ethnic conflicts, bad health, shame, fear and cumulative traumatic experiences. Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations. And people had hope, yes, but until they realized their situation worsens every day -- either because they are being killed or because, somehow, they are poorer than eight years ago. One figure for that: 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition.', '01:52': 'Yet, there is hope. One day a man told me, ""My future does not look brilliant, but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."" This is a picture I took in 2005, walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul, and for me it\'s a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation.', '02:16': 'So, doctors prescribe medication. And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. Military collect weapons, and depression stays intact. Why? Because people don\'t have tools to cope with it, to get over it. So, soon after my arrival, I had confirmed something which I had already known; that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes. However, what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds -- they are universal. And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context. After a counseling session, a woman said to me, ""Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again, and I want to participate again in my family life."" This was very important, because the family is central in Afghans\' social system.', '03:23': 'No one can survive alone. And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed, because something horrible has happened to them, then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation, and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones, because they do not want to burden them. And very often violence is a way to cope with it. Traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks -- so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly, suddenly, and they cannot control it. To compensate this loss of inner control, they try to control the outside, very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately, this fits very well into the traditional side, regressive side, repressive side, restrictive side of the cultural context. So, husbands start beating wives, mothers and fathers beat their children, and afterward, they feel awful. They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control. The desperate try to restore order and normality, and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence, it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt. And partly this is already happening.', '04:52': 'So everybody needs a sense for the future, and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. But let me repeat the words of the woman. ""Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again."" So the key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. Somebody has to feel how you felt. And somebody has to see you and listen to you. Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true, and this only goes with another person. So everybody must be able to say, ""This happened to me, and it did this with me, but I\'m able to live with it, to cope with it, and to learn from it. And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children, and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter,"" -- what happens too often in Afghanistan.', '05:53': 'So something can be done, even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. And I started thinking about a counseling program. But, of course, I needed help and funds. And one evening, I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul, and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. And I explained to him quickly, I would train psycho-social counselors, I would open centers, and I explained to him why. This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said, ""If you want to do this, call me."" At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.', '06:30': ""So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany, and we trained 30 Afghan women and men, and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul. This was our sign -- it's hand-painted, and we had 45 all over Kabul. Eleven thousand people came -- more than that. And 70 percent regained their lives. This was a very exciting time, developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. And they are working with me up to today. We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach. So, from 2008 up until today, a substantial change and step forward has been taking place."", '07:08': 'The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health, to lobby this approach -- we succeeded. We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system. This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff. But for that, we already have the training manuals, which are approved by the Ministry and moreover, this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.', '07:44': 'So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces, and you are the first to see the results. We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression, moderate and severe. And the red line is the treatment as usual -- medication with a medical doctor. And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only, without medication. And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away, and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly, which is explicable, because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses, but you can learn how to cope with them. So this makes us very happy, because now we also have some evidence that this is working.', '08:36': 'So here you see, this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan, and every morning it looks like this all over. And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients, but now this will change. They go to the clinics, because they want to cure their immediate symptoms, and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions, develop their resources, learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future.', '09:08': 'And I would like to share one short vignette. One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor, ""If we were to have met some years ago, then we would have killed each other. And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future."" And another counselor said to me after the training, ""You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village, but now I know, because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."" So I believe this kept me running. And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies.', '10:00': 'I thought it was an idea worth spreading, and I think it must be, can be, could be replicated elsewhere.', '10:08': 'I thank you for your attention.', '10:10': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were the very first life on Earth, and they gave rise to every one of the billions of species that have inhabited our planet since.', '00:36': 'At the time, Earth was almost completely devoid of what we’d recognize as a suitable environment for living things. The young planet had widespread volcanic activity and an atmosphere that created hostile conditions. So where on Earth could life begin?', '00:54': 'To begin the search for the cradle of life, it’s important to first understand the basic necessities for any life form. Elements and compounds essential to life include hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphates, and ammonia. In order for these ingredients to comingle and react with each other, they need a liquid solvent: water. And in order to grow and reproduce, all life needs a source of energy. Life forms are divided into two camps: autotrophs, like plants, that generate their own energy, and heterotrophs, like animals, that consume other organisms for energy. The first life form wouldn’t have had other organisms to consume, of course, so it must have been an autotroph, generating energy either from the sun or from chemical gradients.', '01:49': 'So what locations meet these criteria? Places on land or close to the surface of the ocean have the advantage of access to sunlight. But at the time when life began, the UV radiation on Earth’s surface was likely too harsh for life to survive there. One setting offers protection from this radiation and an alternative energy source: the hydrothermal vents that wind across the ocean floor, covered by kilometers of seawater and bathed in complete darkness.', '02:22': 'A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in the Earth’s crust where seawater seeps into magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures, along with a rich slurry of minerals and simple chemical compounds. Energy is particularly concentrated at the steep chemical gradients of hydrothermal vents.', '02:45': 'There’s another line of evidence that points to hydrothermal vents: the Last Universal Common Ancestor of life, or LUCA for short. LUCA wasn’t the first life form, but it’s as far back as we can trace. Even so, we don’t actually know what LUCA looked like— there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day LUCA still around— instead, scientists identified genes that are commonly found in species across all three domains of life that exist today. Since these genes are shared across species and domains, they must have been inherited from a common ancestor. These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient— like the ones at hydrothermal vents.', '03:37': 'There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent: black smokers and white smokers. Black smokers release acidic, carbon-dioxide-rich water, heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius and packed with sulphur, iron, copper, and other metals essential to life. But scientists now believe that black smokers were too hot for LUCA— so now the top candidates for the cradle of life are white smokers.', '04:06': 'Among the white smokers, a field of hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City has become the most favored candidate for the cradle of life. The seawater expelled here is highly alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in methane and offers more hospitable temperatures. Adjacent black smokers may have contributed the carbon dioxide necessary for life to evolve at Lost City, giving it all the components to support the first organisms that radiated into the incredible diversity of life on Earth today.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's a bit lofty; I'm really more  of something like a street walker.  I spend a lot of time in urban areas  looking for design, and studying design in the public sector.  I take about 5,000 photographs a year,  and I thought that I would edit from these, and try to come up with some images  that might be appropriate and interesting to you. And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages."", '00:52': ""I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example. A very common public design done in the '50s. It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form, very consistent with the Brazilian culture -- I think good design adds to culture. Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York. But I think these are my sort of information highways: I live in much more of an analog world, where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange, and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us."", '01:24': 'How did I get started in this business? I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years, and just loved utilitarian form -- simple things that we use every day, little compositions of color and surface on form. This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach, a company dealing with simple forms, making good designers available to us, and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well, and it seems to have worked. A couple of years into the process, I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.', '01:55': ""And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world, and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture. I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected. And I write a newsletter that goes out every week, and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response that I realized that design, that common design, that's in the public area means a lot to people, and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog."", '02:50': ""I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected. You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike: a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum. But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized, you know, the first job of design is to serve a social purpose. And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike, but being a very good example of design."", '03:42': ""And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities, looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature. I was in Buenos Aires very recently, and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava. He's a Spanish architect and designer. And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use. And I recognized that oftentimes design, when you're set up to see design, it can be a bit of a letdown."", '04:18': ""But there were lots of other things going on in this area: it was a kind of construction zone; a lot of buildings were going up. And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much; you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design. And going a little closer, you get a different perspective. I find these little vignettes, these little accidental pieces of design, to be refreshing. They give me, I don't know, a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve."", '05:04': ""Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure: horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines going across, these magenta squiggles, the workmen being reduced to decorative elements, just a nice, kind of, breakup of the urban place. And, you know, that no longer exists. You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's like listening to little songs or something: it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure. Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park. A terrific use of local materials, but inside you could find some interior compositions. Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games; I go and see design relationships. Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture, and the way that the trees form vertical elements."", '05:48': ""Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs. It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion; it stares back at you the way that a figure might. Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy. Construction site in New York: red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such. Side street in Italy. Red drew me into this little composition, optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox, door service, plumbing. It looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions. In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good. Simple menus put on a board, achieving, kind of, the sort of balance. But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things. Red can be comical: it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana. Color can animate simple blocks, simple materials: walking in New York, I'll stop."", '06:47': ""I don't always know why I take photographs of things. A nice visual composition of symmetry. Curves against sharp things. It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York. I've come across some other just, kind of, curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations, but -- these things amuse me. Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco -- a trash can that's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships, and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture. So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in places that I go."", '07:28': ""Havana is a wonderful area. It's quite free of commercial clutter: you don't see our logos and brands and names, and therefore you're alert to things physically. And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone, and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that. And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful, because of the blockades and things, but a really wonderful playground."", '07:51': ""I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design. In our area, in furnishings, they're sort of way at the top. The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good. And I came across this little street in Venice, where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine. And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative  and so tolerant. The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also, and I think that it's recognizable there, and has an important effect on culture, because their public spaces are protected, their sidewalks are protected, and you're actually able to confront these things physically, and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things."", '08:52': ""A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco. And I use this -- this is, sort of, what I consider to be urban spam. I notice this stuff because I walk a lot, but here, private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector. And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously."", '09:19': ""The extreme might be in Italy where, again, there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident, even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals. I walk to work every day or ride my scooter, and I come down and park in this little spot. And I came down one day, and all the bikes were red. Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,  but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement. And it reminded me that -- to keep in the present, to look out for these kinds of things."", '10:03': ""It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations. But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind. And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements. I was at the art show in Miami in December, and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art, and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it. And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements, it can do just about anything."", '10:56': ""I don't have very many shots of people, because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form. I was in a small restaurant in Spain, having lunch -- one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself, and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet, and feeling very lucky, and a bus load of tourists arrived, emptied out, filled up the restaurant. In a very short period of time, completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such, and we had to get up and leave; it was just that uncomfortable. And at that moment, the sun came out, and through this perforated screen, a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear, and we left the restaurant kind of feeling O.K. about stuff."", '11:50': ""And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society, such as bad form in restaurants, but quite seriously, it was a statement to me that one thing that you do, sort of, see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of, large masses of things, and when you -- in monoculture, and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us."", '12:22': ""The last shots that I have deal with -- coming back to this theme of sidewalks, and I wanted to say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know. Post-Second World War, the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities. A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use. A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal-Mart; I'm not going to do that. But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years, and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers. I think that they are, that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole."", '13:11': ""Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things. But I think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas. A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area. You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop, but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street: there's actual diversity in the plants. And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional."", '14:02': ""There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago, and then there are your big-D design statements: the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry. My measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks, but the fact that it performs a very important social function. There are a lot of free concerts, for example, that go on in this area; it has a phenomenal acoustic system. But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant, and almost an international model. I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco, on the International Design Council for Mayors, and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle, and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there. I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys. This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago, where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created, kind of, a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area. And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S. can really take a leadership role, and Chicago is one example."", '15:14': 'Thank you very much.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Written in Moscow during the 1930s, this surreal blend of political satire, historical fiction, and occult mysticism has earned a legacy as one of the 20th century’s greatest novels– and one of its strangest.', '00:38': 'The story begins when a meeting between two members of Moscow’s literary elite is interrupted by a strange gentleman named Woland, who presents himself as a foreign scholar invited to give a presentation on black magic. As the stranger engages the two companions in a philosophical debate and makes ominous predictions about their fates, the reader is suddenly transported to 1st century Jerusalem. There a tormented Pontius Pilate reluctantly sentences Jesus of Nazareth to death. With the narrative shifting between the two settings, Woland and his entourage– Azazello, Koroviev, Hella, and a giant cat named Behemoth– are seen to have uncanny magical powers, which they use to stage their performance while leaving a trail of havoc and confusion in their wake.', '01:29': 'Much of the novel’s dark humor comes not only from this demonic mischief, but also the backdrop against which it occurs. Bulgakov’s story takes place in the same setting where it was written– the USSR at the height of the Stalinist period. There, artists and authors worked under strict censorship, subject to imprisonment, exile, or execution if they were seen as undermining state ideology. Even when approved, their work– along with housing, travel, and everything else– was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy. In the novel, Woland manipulates this system along with the fabric of reality, to hilarious results. As heads are separated from bodies and money rains from the sky, the citizens of Moscow react with petty-self interest, illustrating how Soviet society bred greed and cynicism despite its ideals. And the matter-of-fact narration deliberately blends the strangeness of the supernatural events with the everyday absurdity of Soviet life.', '02:32': 'So how did Bulgakov manage to publish such a subversive novel under an oppressive regime? Well… he didn’t. He worked on ""The Master and Margarita"" for over ten years. But while Stalin’s personal favor may have kept Bulgakov safe from severe persecution, many of his plays and writings were kept from production, leaving him safe but effectively silenced. Upon the author’s death in 1940, the manuscript remained unpublished. A censored version was eventually printed in the 1960s, while copies of the unabridged manuscript continued to circulate among underground literary circles. The full text was only published in 1973, over 30 years after its completion.', '03:16': 'Bulgakov’s experiences with censorship and artistic frustration lend an autobiographical air to the second part of the novel, when we are finally introduced to its namesake. ""The Master"" is a nameless author who’s worked for years on a novel but burned the manuscript after it was rejected by publishers– just as Bulgakov had done with his own work. Yet the true protagonist is the Master’s mistress Margarita.', '03:42': 'Her devotion to her lover’s abandoned dream bears a strange connection to the diabolical company’s escapades– and carries the story to its surreal climax.', '03:52': 'Despite its dark humor and complex structure, ""The Master and Margarita"" is, at its heart, a meditation on art, love, and redemption, that never loses itself in cynicism. And the book’s long overdue publication and survival against the odds is a testament to what Woland tells the Master: “Manuscripts don’t burn.”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich. And it comes in a male form, too -- very glamorous. Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo. But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters, but also comes in other forms."", '00:40': ""A magazine? Well, it's certainly not this one. This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips. Sex tips are not glamorous. And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm, is not glamorous either. But there is a glamour of industry. This is Margaret Bourke-White's -- one of her pictures she did. Fantastic, glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. This is the Hewlett-Packard garage. We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett-Packard. There's the glamour of physics. What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe, grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene -- he has other kinds of glamour."", '01:29': 'And there is, of course, this glamour. This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space -- and not the alien-style glamour, but the nice, clean, early \'60s version. So what do we mean by glamour? Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary. Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning, and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it. You had ""a"" glamour. It wasn\'t glamour as a quality -- you ""cast a glamour."" Glamour was a literal magic spell. Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today, but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent, Celtic magic. And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century, it started to take on this other kind of deception -- this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with, an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. But still, glamour is an illusion. Glamour is a magic spell. And there\'s something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you, it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest.', '02:53': 'Well of course, in the 20th century, glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. And this is Hedy Lamarr. Hedy Lamarr said, ""Anyone can look glamorous, all you have to do is sit there and look stupid."" (Laughter) But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy -- about whom we\'ll hear more later -- there\'s a lot more to it. There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour. There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts. You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor\'s special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up. So you\'ve got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star. And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time -- they call them false color.', '03:46': 'Glamour is a form of falsification, but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film. And it involves a great deal of technique. It\'s not -- glamour is not something -- you don\'t wake up in the morning glamorous. I don\'t care who you are. Even Nicole Kidman doesn\'t wake up in the morning glamorous. There is a process of ""idealization, glorification and dramatization,"" and it\'s not just the case for people. Glamour doesn\'t have to be people. Architectural photography -- Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration, took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House. Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. It puts you into this special, special world. This is Alex Ross\'s comic book art, which appears to be extremely realistic, as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art. Except that light doesn\'t work this way in the real world.', '04:43': 'When you stack people in rows, the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour. What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine, which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday. And I think that that\'s starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. This is Filippino Lippi\'s 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia. And I don\'t know who she is either, but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel. It\'s a very glamorous portrait. Why is it glamorous? It\'s glamorous, first, because she is beautiful -- but that does not make you glamorous, that only makes you beautiful. She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent, and those are the central qualities of glamour. You don\'t see her eyes; they\'re looking downward. She\'s not looking away from you exactly, but you have to mentally imagine her world. She\'s encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture. Mel Gibson\'s ""Passion Of The Christ"" -- not glamorous. That\'s glamour: that\'s Michelangelo\'s ""Pieta,"" where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they\'re both awfully happy and pleasant.', '06:07': ""Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant -- that's why, often in these glamour shots, the person is not looking at the audience, it's why sunglasses are glamorous -- but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. In some sense, there has to be something like us. So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent, omniscient -- too far above us. And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms. As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people, but it has to have this transcendent quality. What is it about Superman? Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous, one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly."", '06:58': ""Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside. The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough. The story is about where you're arriving, or thinking about where you're arriving. And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period, but because, in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday."", '07:55': 'The same thing -- arches are very glamorous. Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous. Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because, to me, it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life -- but maybe that\'s because I went to Princeton. Anyway, skylines are super glamorous, city streets -- not so glamorous. You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality. The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous. There are few things more glamorous than the horizon -- except, possibly, multiple horizons. Of course, here you don\'t feel the cold, or the heat -- you just see the possibilities. In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book, ""The Book Of The Courtier."" There\'s the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today, after a few centuries.', '08:56': 'And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art. It makes things look effortless. You don\'t think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural. And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies, how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. Of course, they covered that with make-up, because Lara Croft did all those same stunts -- but she doesn\'t get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura. ""To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort"": And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. Glamour is about editing. How do you create the sense of transcendence, the sense of evoking a perfect world? The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this -- I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world. We don\'t tell you all the grubby details.', '09:47': 'Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year. This is underneath Jeff\'s desk. This is what the real world of computers, lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like. But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this. There are no cords. Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. But there\'s always this illusion that if you buy this lamp, you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter) And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras, you don\'t get to live in the world without cords. You have to have mystery and you have to have grace. And there she is -- Grace. This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever. Part of the thing is that, in ""Rear Window,"" the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world? And the answer is no, but of course it\'s really just a movie.', '10:46': ""Here's Hedy Lamarr again. And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time. Translucence is glamorous -- that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque. It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous. It has that sense of going up and away, and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down. And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning. All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality."", '11:49': ""They have contradictions, they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other -- whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals. And the way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world, an imagined world, an age of heroes, the world to come. And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object. The white picket fence, the perfect house. The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like. The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace, the perfect diamond ring. The perfect getaway in your perfect car. This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia. The perfect office -- again, no cords, as far as I can tell. And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office. I mean, there's no paper on the desk. We want this golden world. And some people get rich enough, and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense, they get to acquire their perfect world."", '12:54': 'Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is -- I don\'t think accidentally -- in Art Deco style. That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. This is not always good, because what is your perfect world? What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out? Is it something important? ""The Matrix"" is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on ""The Matrix"" and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence, because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course, they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world. This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo. This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too. You know, we\'re marching toward Utopia.', '13:41': 'I\'m not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad. Because what they\'re doing is they\'re saying, your coat\'s not so glamorous, what\'s been edited out is something important. But actually, what\'s even more important than remembering what\'s been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good? Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. And it\'s not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. This is from ""Triumph Of The Will"" -- brilliant editing to cut together things. There\'s a glamour shot. National Socialism is all about glamour. It was a very aesthetic ideology. It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world, and ridding it of anything unglamorous. So glamour can be dangerous.', '14:20': ""I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it. And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all, and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy, but also enjoy how it happens. And here's Hedy Lamarr. She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology. So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid, even though she thought she could look stupid."", '14:58': 'David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash, which only took a fraction of a second to happen. There is a book out in the bookstore -- it\'s called ""Symphony In Steel,"" and it\'s about the stuff that\'s hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. And that has a fascination. It\'s not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal. There\'s a wonderful book called ""Crowns"" that\'s all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats. And there\'s a quote from one of these women, and she talks about, ""As a little girl, I\'d admire women at church with beautiful hats. They looked like beautiful dolls, like they\'d just stepped out of a magazine. But I also knew how hard they worked all week. Sometimes under those hats there\'s a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."" And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it. Thank you.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers who fought to maintain slavery -- mostly in the South -- from the 1890s to the 1950s, when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect. To this day, black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders in our public spaces. These memorials are a physical representation of a system that is actively working to define whose lives matter and whose lives do not.', '01:01': 'If we are going to disrupt the narrative, we have to start at the origin. Genocide, slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas with Christopher Columbus. Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 1492. Fewer people know that an estimated 250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out within two years of his arrival. Even fewer people know that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doña Juana de la Torre that ""nine and 10-year-old girls were in high demand, and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid."" Yet New York City\'s Columbus Circle has had him perched 76 feet high next to Central Park since 1892.', '01:48': ""I started Movers and Shakers, a nonprofit, to get the statue removed. Movers and Shakers is a group of activists, artists, educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology to highlight the narratives of the oppressed. In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal, we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism. We created an augmented reality installation on the true story of Christopher Columbus and used it to host teach-ins in Columbus Circle and Times Square. Many see the controversy around the statue as tension between the Italian-American community and the indigenous community. The reality is that most black people are here in this country as a result of the atrocities that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus. So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade. I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue. I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment at their football team's home opener."", '03:04': ""We gave it everything that we had, but in the end, New York City decided to keep the statue, and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark. The news was devastating, but it opened up another door. We realized that with augmented reality you don't need permission from the government to put up a monument or to make a statement. You can just do it. So New York City right now currently has more than 150 statues of men and six of women and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well. So we decided, why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments of women and people of color throughout the city?"", '03:45': ""Typically, monuments are created to commemorate the achievements of the deceased, but with augmented reality, we can reroute the rules. We started with sports. Colin Kaepernick. He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, and he wanted to use his platform to highlight the injustice of systemic racism. So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this, and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem. He lost his contract with the 49ers, he was blackballed by every NFL owner, he was criticized by millions and even the president of the United States decided to insult him. It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage, so our team decided to do this. Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee in augmented reality, and there's nothing they can do about it."", '04:43': '(Laughter)', '04:45': ""Representation matters. Serena Williams proved to the world that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs. Let's celebrate her now."", '04:59': ""Jackie Robinson.

We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field so that anyone can see him swing for the fences in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn."", '05:16': 'With augmented reality, we have the power to tell stories in public spaces that need to be told. The achievements of people like Frida Kahlo, Audre Lorde, Toussaint Louverture, Madam C.J. Walker -- this should be common knowledge. Our vision is a ""Pokémon Go"" for a contextualized history.', '05:38': 'Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations that are fighting against systemic oppression.

The tiniest is practically invisible. Some bloom high up in trees, while others live underground. All in, there are around 28,000 species of orchid on earth – about as many as all the bird, mammal and reptile species combined. They grow all over the world, bearing every imaginable colour, shape, and pattern. And there’s a cunning purpose behind these elaborate displays: many orchids trick insects, sometimes even into having sex with them.', '00:52': 'Like other flowers, most orchids need to attract insects to gather their pollen and carry it between plants. But unlike most flowers, which attract a range of pollinators with sweet nectar, these masters of deception deploy other tactics– like pretending to be an insect’s mate, letting off alluring scents, and mimicking the appearance of other species.', '01:18': 'One of their most intriguing methods is sexual deception. Through a combination of sexy shapes and pheromones, orchids convince insects to mate with them. Take the bee orchid, whose petals look almost exactly like the velvety body of a bee. This disguise is so convincing that male bees land on the orchid and try to have sex with it, picking up pollen as they go. Other orchids have evolved contrasting colours and ultraviolet spots– invisible to humans but irresistible to insects. Still others have tactile ‘love-handles’ that ensure insects are positioned precisely for pollination. When a male wasp lands on the hammer orchid, for example, his enthusiastic mating motion flips a hinge in the flower, forcing his body into the pollen. At the next flower he visits, that same hinge pushes his pollen-covered body onto the stigma, fertilizing it. Some orchids make such convincing mates that insects even ejaculate on them, wasting valuable sperm.', '02:29': 'But the most vital component of sexual deception is scent: orchids mimic the precise scent of a single insect species. This is possible because many insects and flowers produce simple organic compounds called hydrocarbons, which form a layer that protects their bodies from drying out. The precise blend of compounds in this layer is species-specific. Its scent can double as a way for insects to attract potential mates, known as a sex pheromone. Over the course of many thousands of years, random compound combinations have given some orchid species precisely the same signature scent as particular insect species. This matching scent allows them to attract male pollinators who fall over and over again for the flowers masquerading as females of their own species.', '03:24': 'Sexual deception isn’t the only trick orchids have up their sleeves. Their oldest scam is mimicking the shapes and colours of other nectar-producing flowers— but without the sweet nectar. Some orchids also masquerade as places where insects lay their eggs. One species not only has the colour and appearance of rotting meat; it emits a scent of decay as well– drawing in flies who deposit their eggs on the flower and unwittingly pollinate the plant. Other orchids look and smell just like the fungi on which certain insects lay their eggs.', '04:01': 'Where do all these bizarre adaptations come from? Random genetic mutations in orchids may result in a trait– like a scent or a shape– that, by chance, matches the needs of a single insect species. The huge diversity within the insect world also increases the likelihood that an orchid will find a unique audience. Able to make more seeds and offspring with the help of its dedicated pollinators, the orchid successfully reproduces in isolation, and becomes a new species. But because of their dependence on sometimes just one pollinator species, orchids are also vulnerable, and many quickly go extinct.', '04:43': 'Over time, though, more orchid species have formed than died out, and orchids are some of the most diverse flowering plants. They have such exuberant and otherworldly shapes that they occasionally deceive human senses, too: In their petals we see what appear to be tiny, dancing people, monkey’s faces, spiders, and even birds in flight.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And so, the whole range of references to information elsewhere on the internet is the domain of the hyperlink."", '01:05': ""Back when I was in school -- this is before people had wide access to the internet -- if I was going to do a research paper, I would have to physically walk to the library, and if they had the book that you needed, great. You sometimes had to send out for it, so the process could take weeks. And it's kind of crazy to think about that now, because, like all great innovations, it's not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted."", '01:31': 'Back in 1945, there was this guy, Vannevar Bush. He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put forth was, ""Wow, humans are creating so much information, and we can\'t keep track of all the books that we\'ve read or the connections between important ideas."" And he had this idea called the ""memex,"" where you could put together a personal library of all of the books and articles that you have access to. And that idea of connecting sources captured people\'s imaginations.', '02:01': 'Later, in the 1960s, Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu, and he said, ""Well, what if it wasn\'t just limited to the things that I have? What if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?"" In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland developed a system they called HyperTIES. They were the first to use text itself as a link marker. They figured out that this blue link on a gray background was going to work really well in terms of contrast, and people would be able to see it.', '02:31': 'Apple invented HyperCard in 1987. You had these stacks of cards, and you could create links in between the cards. HyperCard actually created the ability to jump around in a story. These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along, because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative.', '02:54': ""These ideas and inventions, among others, inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block, this very basic building block to a very complex web of connections that exists all around the world. Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed, they were intended to be not only used by many people, but created by many people. To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since HPV is often transmitted through sexual activity, this usually means the cells of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth and throat. We can test for HPV in cells from these areas, but while testing for the virus is scientifically possible, it isn’t common. The main reason is that, while there are treatments for the adverse health effects caused by HPV, there’s no treatment for the virus itself. So testing for HPV would yield many, many positives, and although most of them won’t be cause for concern, there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus.', '01:13': 'But there are other good ways to protect yourself from HPV. We’re going to walk through how HPV can cause harm, who’s at risk, and how to minimize those risks.', '01:23': 'The body’s immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HPV before they cause any harm— and without people even knowing they’ve been infected. Certain other strains– like HPV 6 and 11– cause abnormalities in the cells of the infected tissue, which can develop into genital warts. While these are infectious and require treatment, usually with topical creams, wart-causing strains don’t create longer-term damage. But another 13 strains can cause DNA mutations that cause cells to divide at a much faster pace than normal, propelling the development of cancerous growths. The cells of the cervix are especially at risks. Two in particular– HPV 16 and 18– are responsible for the majority of cases of cervical cancer, which is now the fourth most common type of cancer in women.', '02:14': 'It can take up to 20 years for cancer symptoms to appear, but with regular screening, we can discover cellular abnormalities in the cervix before they develop into cancer. Women over 21 can undergo a regular pap smear, where a sample of tissue is gently scraped from the lining of the cervix to test for abnormal cells. A positive test doesn’t mean the person has cervical cancer, but rather that there are irregular cells in the cervix that could develop into cancer in the future.', '02:43': 'Patients are then either monitored with more frequent pap smears, or, for more severe irregularities, undergo a procedure called a colposcopy. This involves a doctor examining the cervix through a microscope, and possibly taking a small biopsy of tissue for closer examination. In some cases, the affected tissue may be removed.', '03:04': 'HPV infections of the throat may lead to head and neck cancers, but for now there’s no equivalent of the pap smear for the throat. Using condoms helps prevent the spread of HPV during sex. And there are three safe, effective vaccines that all target HPV 16 and 18. The vaccine comes in two or three doses a few months apart, and it’s only beneficial if you receive them all. Right now the vaccine is part of standard care for girls aged 11 to 18 in many countries– though it’s increasingly becoming available to boys as well. Adult women and men in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom can opt to receive the vaccine, and evidence suggests that vaccination of women and men could reduce the worldwide incidence of cervical cancer by almost 90%. Researchers are also developing an injection for people who are already infected with HPV 16 and 18, which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into cancerous ones. So while there’s still room for improvement in screening, treatment, and access to each, condom use, vaccination, and cervical screening can each reduce the harm caused by HPV.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But as Stepan and his men ride towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds.', '00:30': 'Having made their home in the Wild Fields north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic word for ""free man""— are renowned as one of Europe’s most formidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these fertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly difficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning of their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but their victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing on what their next move should be.', '01:41': 'Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, he cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions on recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military training and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby villages, outside Cossack lands.', '02:23': 'Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with the tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well- organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several hundred man regiment.', '02:55': 'Inside, the men dine on dried fish, sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to lighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument has broken out. One of his men has raised a toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance with Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and he expects his men to do the same.', '03:28': 'Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, or general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their way towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman camp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, and bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed sense of brotherhood.', '04:04': 'Over the next 200 years, these freedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of independence and defiance.

Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age. And there is a major shift coming on the horizon. The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the 12th of January in 2010. Haiti was a game changer. The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince, claiming the lives of some 320,000 people, rendering homeless about 1.2 million people. Government institutions were completely decapitated, including the presidential palace. I remember standing on the roof of the Ministry of Justice in downtown Port-au-Prince. It was about two meters high, completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake.', '00:59': ""For those of us on the ground in those early days, it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that Haiti was something different. Haiti was something we hadn't seen before. But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented. Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper-connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices."", '01:27': 'Because out of the urban devastation in Port-au-Prince came a torrent of SMS texts -- people crying for help, beseeching us for assistance, sharing data, offering support, looking for their loved ones. This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered. We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet, but 80 percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands. And we were unprepared for this, and they were shaping the aid effort.', '02:00': 'Outside Haiti also, things were looking different. Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers were scouring the Internet, converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open-source maps, layering them with all sorts of important information -- people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map -- and putting these on the Web for everybody -- the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves -- to participate in and to use.', '02:28': ""Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS. People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress, were signaling their need for help. On street sides all over Port-au-Prince, entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations. They understood more than we did people's innate need to be connected."", '02:55': ""Never having been confronted with this type of situation before, we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource, how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology. We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voilà, which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International. We had basically three requirements. We wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication. We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well. We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities. We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time. And we wanted it to be easy to use."", '03:37': ""Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since. It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters. It has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather-related disasters. It's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera. And it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence."", '04:09': 'But does it work? We have just published an evaluation of this program, and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable. Some 74 percent of people received the data. Those who were intended to receive the data, 74 percent of them received it. 96 percent of them found it useful. 83 percent of them took action -- evidence that it is indeed empowering. And 73 percent of them shared it.', '04:44': 'The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region. It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect. Technology is transformational. Right across the developing world, citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change, positive change, in their own communities. The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models, the old analog models of control and command.', '05:20': ""One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera. Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums. It's on the outskirts of Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. It's home to an unknown number of people -- some say between 250,000 and 1.2 million. If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map, Kibera is represented as a lush, green national park devoid of human settlement."", '05:47': 'Young people living in Kibera in their community, with simple handheld devices, GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones, have literally put themselves on the map. They have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible. People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information, real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use. You can find out about the latest impromptu music session. You can find out about the latest security incident. You can find out about places of worship. You can find out about the health centers. You can feel the dynamism of this living, breathing community. They also have their own news network on YouTube with 36,000 viewers at the moment.', '06:34': ""They're showing us what can be done with mobile, digital technologies. They're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible. And they are giving a voice to themselves. They are telling their own story, bypassing the official narrative."", '06:50': ""And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories. In Mongolia for instance, where 30 percent of the people are nomadic, SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns. SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. And if people are migrating into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments, they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge. In Nigeria, open-source SMS tools are being used by the Red Cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria. My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program, tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things."", '07:43': 'And not only is it empowering to the communities, but really importantly, this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices. We are on a planet of seven billion people, five billion mobile subscriptions. By 2015, there will be three billion smartphones in the world. The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the Developing World, compared to 20 percent today. We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart, fast mobile devices.', '08:29': 'People are understanding, from Cairo to Oakland, that there are new ways to come together, there are new ways to mobilize, there are new ways to influence. A transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models. The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing. We need to, for example, embrace the big data, the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data.', '09:09': 'One idea that I\'d like you to consider, for instance, is to take a look at our IT departments. They\'re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers, but they need to be elevated to software strategists. We need people in our organizations who know what it\'s like to work with big data. We need technology as a core organizational principle. We need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question, ""What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data?"" and convert it to humanitarian good.', '09:42': ""The possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations, not only ensure that people's right to information is met, or that they have their right to communicate, but I think in the future, humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard, that they're truly participating, that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world. It has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort. We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities. There are no more reasons not to do it. I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital."", '10:34': 'Thank you very much.', '10:36': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it will be quite a challenge for me.', '00:30': 'Most African stories these days, they talk about famine, HIV and AIDS, poverty or war. But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success. It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia. Namibia has got 2.1 million people, but it is only twice the size of California.', '00:59': ""I come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country. It's called Kunene region. And in the center of Kunene region is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born. This is where I'm coming from. Most people that are following the story of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will know where Namibia is. They love Namibia for its beautiful dunes, that are even taller than the Empire State Building. Wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes, and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land."", '01:47': 'I\'m a Himba. You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes? I\'m a Himba and Namibian. A Himba is one of the 29 ethnic groups in Namibia. We live a very traditional lifestyle. I grew up herding, looking after our livestock -- goats, sheep and cattle. And one day, my father actually took me into the bush. He said, ""John, I want you to become a good herder. Boy, if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it. Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."" (Laughter) ""And he will let go of the goat and run off."" But then he said, ""Boy, if you run into a lion, don\'t move. Don\'t move. Stand your ground. Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you."" (Laughter) But then, he said, ""If you see a leopard, boy, you better run like hell."" (Laughter) ""Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."" In this way -- (Laughter) In this way, I actually started to learn about nature.', '03:29': ""In addition to being an ordinary Namibian and in addition to being a Himba I'm also a trained conservationist. And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from. I was born in 1971. We lived under apartheid regime. The whites could farm, graze and hunt as they wished, but we black, we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife. Whenever we tried to hunt, we were called poachers. And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail."", '04:10': 'Between 1966 and 1990, the U.S. and Soviet interests fought for control over my country. And you know, during war time, there are militaries, armies, that are moving around. And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks. They could sell these things for anything between $5,000 a kilo. During the same year almost every Himba had a rifle. Because it was wartime, the British .303 rifle was just all over the whole country.', '04:47': 'Then in the same time, around 1980, we had a very big drought. It killed almost everything that was left. Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction, protected as well. We were hungry. I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed. It\'s a very sad story. But even today, that memory is still in people\'s minds. They can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened. And then, in the same year, we almost lost everything. And my father said, ""Why don\'t you just go to school?"" And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.', '05:37': 'And the year I went to school, my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities. They were trusted by the local communities like our leader, Joshua Kangombe. Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening: wildlife disappearing, poaching was skyrocketing, and the situation seemed very hopeless. Death and despair surrounded Joshua and our entire communities.', '06:12': 'But then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua: What if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife? Do you have anybody in your communities, or people, that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well? The headman said: ""Yes. Our poachers."" ""Eh? The poachers?"" ""Yes. Our poachers."" And that was my father. My father has been a poacher for quite a long time. Instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in Africa, IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and manage wildlife. And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife, wildlife numbers started coming back, and that\'s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia. With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government.', '07:22': ""Three things that actually help to build on this foundation: The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas. Here is our tradition: At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire. And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water, where to get grazings, and where to go and hunt. And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment. And here are the new ideas. Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it? And these things we were taught by outsiders. We learned these things from outsiders. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands; we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether -- can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West? And we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world. And through this, we actually started realizing our dreams, and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas."", '08:51': ""The second element is that we wanted to have a life, a better life where we can benefit through many things. Most poachers, like my father, were people from our own community. They were not people from outside. These were our own people. And sometimes, once they were caught, they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams. The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father -- (Laughter) they were put in charge to stop others from poaching. And when this thing started going on, we started becoming one community, renewing our connection to nature. And that was a very strong thing in Namibia."", '09:40': ""The last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships. Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands. The other partners that we have got is business communities. Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative, through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up-to-date conservation practices. They have also given funding for two decades to this whole program. And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund, we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today. Namibia ... or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere, hidden away in Namibia. With these assets we are now part of the global village."", '10:49': ""Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as I and my children see it today. When I finished school in 1995, there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area. But today, there are more than 130 lions. (Applause) So please, if you go to Namibia, make sure that you stay in the tents. Don't walk out at night!"", '11:28': '(Laughter)', '11:29': 'The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982. But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino -- free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world. This is outside the protected area.', '11:44': '(Applause)', '11:47': 'The leopard -- they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village, because the natural plain has multiplied, like zebras, springboks and everything. They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.', '12:08': 'What started as very small, community rangers getting community involved, has now grown into something that we call conservancies. Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government, and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit. Today, we have got 60 conservancies that manage and protect over 13 million hectares of land in Namibia. We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country. Nowhere else in the world has community-adopted conservation at this scale.', '12:51': '(Applause)', '12:56': 'In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars. This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources. And we are able to use this money for many things: Very importantly, we put it in education. Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food. Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops.', '13:32': '(Applause)', '13:39': ""And now, what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in Namibia to other places with similar problems: places like Mongolia, or even in your own backyards, the Northern Great Plains, where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline. I like that one: Namibia serving as a model to Africa, and Africa serving as a model to the United States. (Applause) We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife. We knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities. So, come and talk to me about Namibia, and better yet, come to Namibia and see for yourself how we have done it. And please, do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM in Africa and across the world.

I don\'t believe in a life or history written as decision ""A"" led to consequence ""B"" led to consequence ""C"" -- these neat narratives that we\'re presented with, and that perhaps we encourage in each other. I believe in randomness, and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random. I\'m colorblind. I was born unable to see most colors. This is why I wear gray and black most of the time, and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes.', '01:03': 'And I\'d always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, and sure enough, I failed. I couldn\'t see all the blinking different lights, and I can\'t distinguish color. So I had to choose another career, and this was in fact relatively easy for me, because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood, which was international relations. As a child, I read the newspaper thoroughly. I was fascinated by the Cold War, by the INF negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles, the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan. These things really interested me. And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. And I, one day, I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said, ""Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."" And he turned to me, and he said, ""Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."" (Laughter) And my ambition was sealed.', '02:14': ""In 1989, I entered the British Foreign Service. That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat, and 20 of us succeeded. And as those numbers suggest, I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. Being a diplomat, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it. I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. I traveled to the Gaza Strip. I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. I met Yasser Arafat. I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. Later, I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan, surrounded by my Special Forces escort, who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines, because it was so dangerous. And that was exciting -- that was fun. It was really interesting. And it's a great cadre of people, incredibly close-knit community of people."", '03:43': ""And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out, was when I was posted to New York. I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. And my responsibility was the Middle East, which was my specialty. And there, I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process, the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later, if you wish -- but above all, my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons. I was the chief British negotiator on the subject, and I was steeped in the issue. And anyway, my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time. I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before, which were, of course, deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time. So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times kind of experience. I lived the high-life. Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant. (Laughter) I had a good time."", '05:16': ""But in 2002, when my tour came to an end, I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London. I decided to take a sabbatical, in fact, at the New School, Bruce. In some inchoate, inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work, with me. I was exhausted, and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. And I decided to take some time out from work. The Foreign Office was very generous. You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them, and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work. It was nice. And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration."", '06:06': ""And two things happened in Kosovo, which kind of, again, shows the randomness of life, because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage. But they were random things. One was that, in the summer of 2004, the British government, somewhat reluctantly, decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War, a very limited subject. And I testified to that inquiry in secret. I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD, and my testimony to the inquiry said three things: that the government exaggerated the intelligence, which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us. Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war, which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. The third reason, I won't go into. But anyway, I gave that testimony, and that presented me with a crisis. What was I going to do? This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues, of my ministers, who had, in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood."", '07:24': 'And so I was in crisis. And this wasn\'t a pretty thing. I moaned about it, I hesitated, I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife, and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. I felt -- there\'s a scene in the Al Pacino movie ""The Insider,"" which you may know, where he goes back to CBS after they\'ve let him down over the tobacco guy, and he goes, ""You know, I just can\'t do this anymore. Something\'s broken."" And it was like that for me. I love that movie. I felt just something\'s broken. I can\'t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them. So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff.', '08:06': 'And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling. And I started to fall. And today, that fall hasn\'t stopped; I\'m still falling. But, in a way, I\'ve got used to the sensation of it. And in a way, I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff, wondering what to do. A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me. A second thing happened in Kosovo, which kind of delivered the answer, which I couldn\'t really answer, which is, ""What do I do with my life?"" I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country. I wanted to be an ambassador, and my mentors, my heroes, people who got to the top of my profession, and here I was throwing it all away. A lot of my friends were still in it. My pension was in it. And I gave it up. And what was I going to do?', '09:09': ""And that year, in Kosovo, this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw. In March 2004, there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo. 18 people were killed. It was anarchy. And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy, to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street. And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing. And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it. And I went through it. I went through those mobs. And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed. And that riot taught me something, which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story."", '09:55': ""But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots, which went on for several days, took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future. There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then, and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people, were not actually participating in those talks. There was this whole fancy diplomatic system, this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo, and the Kosovars weren't part of it. And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that. Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives. It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. But that was one of the reasons."", '10:40': 'And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise, it gave my wife the inspiration. She said, ""Why don\'t you advise the Kosovars? Why don\'t you advise their government on their diplomacy?"" And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. They were not allowed diplomats. They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process, which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea. That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat, the world\'s first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot. And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him, ""Look, I\'m proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. I know this stuff. It\'s what I do. Why don\'t I come and help you?"" And he raised his glass of raki to me and said, ""Yes, Carne. Come.""', '11:32': ""And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo. And Kosovo became independent. Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world, and we're advising seven or eight different countries, or political groups, depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions. We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. We're advising the Burmese opposition, the government of Southern Sudan, which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years. We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara, who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession. We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations, which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen."", '12:30': 'There\'s a bit of randomness here too because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat, I went to a party in the House of Lords, which is a ridiculous place, but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me. And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York. And he said, ""Why don\'t you see my colleagues in New York?"" And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!, which some of you have probably heard of. And one thing led to another, and I ended up having a desk in ?What If! in New York, when I started Independent Diplomat. And watching ?What If! develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy, like business, is a business of solving problems, and yet the word innovation doesn\'t exist in diplomacy; it\'s all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they\'ve always done things.', '13:43': ""And Independent Diplomat, today, tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!. We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with, but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients. It's not easy, because our clients, by definition, are having a difficult time, diplomatically."", '14:14': ""There are, I don't know, some lessons from all of this, personal and political -- and in a way, they're the same thing. The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing, and I recommend it. And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world, which is that the world is fragmenting. States mean less than they used to, and the power of the state is declining. That means the power of others things is rising. Those other things are called non-state actors. They may be corporations, they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs, they may anything, any number of things. We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world, then that means, who is left to deal with them, who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them? Us. If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it? We have no choice but to embrace that reality."", '15:31': ""What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations, or global affairs, or chaos in Somalia, or what's going on in Burma is none of your business, and that you can leave it to governments to get on with. I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia. Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough, but that connection is there. We are all intimately connected. And this isn't just Tom Friedman, it's actually provable in case after case after case. What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things, you have to look to yourself to do things. And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way."", '16:17': ""There aren't neat examples, but one example is this: the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. was established in 1945. Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict. Today, 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states, involving non-state parties -- guerillas, separatists, terrorists, if you want to call them that, people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states. That is the state of the world today. When I realized this, and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars, and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there, weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council, I thought, this is wrong. Something's got to be done about this."", '17:14': 'So I started off in a traditional mode. Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis -- you name them, we went to see them -- the secretary general, all of them, and said, ""This is all wrong. This is terrible that you don\'t consult these people who are actually affected. You\'ve got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think. This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think. It\'ll be great. You can have an exchange. You can actually incorporate these people\'s views into your decisions, which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."" Super-logical, you would think. I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it. And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, ""Yes, of course, you\'re absolutely right. Come back to us in maybe six months."" And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything. The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago.', '18:15': ""So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought, what can we do about it. And I thought, I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done. So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. So now, Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council. So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups, the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots, rebels from Aceh, and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world. And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council, and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. So there's actually a conversation, which has never before happened. And of course, describing all this, any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult, and I entirely agree with you. The chances of failure are very high, but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen."", '19:36': 'And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today, and I think that outputs is what matters, not process, not technology, frankly, so much either. Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran, where Ahmadinejad remains in power. Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. You\'ve got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself, ""What can I do to produce that particular output?"" That is the politics of the 21st century, and in a way, Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation, that change, that is happening to all of us.', '20:18': ""That's my story.

Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt for extraterrestrial life.', '00:31': 'We’ve honed in on these three moons because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains a liquid ocean– and liquid can support the formation of life.', '00:43': 'Living organisms have to be able to grow, reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the formation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under the force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently in a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that lead to the formation of living matter.', '01:15': 'That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules that we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively temperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against large shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in aquatic environments may have supported the emergence of life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true in other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons.', '01:54': 'Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most intriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker than Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden ocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its potential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a mystery until we can explore it further.', '02:25': 'Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that might have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of ice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area of the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an ocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and tiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether these geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether the geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material from that hidden sea.', '03:07': 'Although it’s the best known substance for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium that can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other organic molecules. Its clouds condense and rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas full of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means it’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities of organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could possibly support unfamiliar life forms.', '03:50': 'So what might indicate that life exists on these or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists speculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria we have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly observe from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues called biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral traces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be challenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our probes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally contaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life.', '04:37': 'Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many ocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto.', '04:55': 'If there’s this much potential for life to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might the rest of the universe contain?'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see. We're not the only ones."", '00:31': '(Laughter)', '00:34': '(Applause)', '00:40': 'And you know, it\'s amazing. I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that, you know? And this is typically what we\'ve been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now, why is that a problem? A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, ""OK, you know, Ory, you\'re Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, \'Forget the poor people. Let\'s focus on business and the markets, and whatever.\' "" And they\'re all, ""There\'s the 80 percent of Africans who really need help.""', '01:24': ""And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK? And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad, we had porridge. And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey. Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free."", '02:16': ""And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school? Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did."", '03:11': 'They talk about corruption. In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there\'s national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed, and I was like, ""Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"" And my father said, ""OK, listen. Let\'s go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know, it\'s just one point. I mean, maybe she\'ll let you in if that slot\'s still there."" So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn\'t have privilege, and because my father didn\'t have the right last name, he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are? And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there. And there\'s nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know? And we left, and I swore to myself, and I was like, ""I\'m never, ever going to have to beg for anything in my life."" They called me two weeks later, they\'re like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.', '04:36': '(Laughter) (Applause)', '04:38': ""Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999. He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know. Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on."", '05:28': ""The first time he got sick, he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know, so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him."", '06:38': 'And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me? With pity, you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don\'t see the other side of me. You don\'t see the blogger, you don\'t see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know? And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what? But it\'s damaging. And I\'m not unique, right? Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn\'t know about the windmill, you know? And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like, I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him, you know, ""Just do it!""', '07:37': '(Laughter)', '07:40': ""And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- we're ignoring the potential. So, what is to be done? First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example, you know, blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers. The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up -- is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this."", '08:50': ""People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing? Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers? Why are we not generating our own content? You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach, you know, is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture. No, you're not."", '09:27': '(Laughter)', '09:39': ""But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay? You know, just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough, you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures. With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here, you know? I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing."", '10:28': ""One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities. But there is such a need, you know? I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress. It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask."", '11:20': ""And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing? You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies, we need -- where's that coming from, you know? Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know? They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like? And how can we change that? So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here? I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge."", '12:15': 'And I\'d ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you\'ve gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I\'ve had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like, ""OK, if you don\'t do aid, I\'m a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"" And when I talk about my ideas, they\'re like, ""BBut it\'s not scalable, you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal."" It\'s not that easy, you know? And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you\'ve met, and the businesspeople you\'ve met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom\'s business had collapsed, so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees, and she\'s really smart. I was paying her school fees.', '13:18': 'A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her? You know, she\'s now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people. So, don\'t underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He\'s a professor. He\'s now at Vanderbilt. He\'s an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson. And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don\'t normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said, ""What do you want to do when you grow up?"" I said, ""I want to be a lawyer."" And he was like, ""Why? You know, we don\'t need another lawyer in the United States."" And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, ""OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I\'m poli-sci Ph.D. But, you know, let\'s figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out.""', '14:14': 'It was like, ""Where do you want to go?"" And to me at that time university -- I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I\'m like, ""Yeah, I\'m just applying to Pitt for law school."" He was like, ""Why? You know, you\'re smart, you have all these things going for you."" And I\'m like, ""Because I\'m here and it\'s cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."" Like, that\'s the dumbest reason I\'ve ever heard for applying to law school. And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. And he said, ""Look, you can get into Harvard, you\'re that good, OK? And if they don\'t admit you, they\'re the ones who are messed up."" And he built me up, you know? And this is just an illustration.', '14:55': ""You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know? A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us. And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you."", '16:15': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What have you done with so many years of being away? And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines. And obviously they were, ""Is this what you spent years doing? And we expected huge masterpieces!"" But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything -- just in a reduced, small version. In a way, I feel like that. I feel like I’m coming home to talk about what I’ve been away doing for 20 years. And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about: a handful of films -- nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films. So, we’ll go with the first piece.', '01:58': '(Video) Woman: ""I destroy lives,"" mum said. I love her, you know. She’s not even my real mum.

Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real? You make people fuckin' sleep. Dream about bullshit."", '05:45': '(Applause)', '05:49': ""Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me, and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema. The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there. These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through. I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now. I've been away 20 years in total. And so it’s really -- it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history. So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated."", '06:58': 'Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality. Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people? And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think, I mean, with all this anger that\'s built up inside of him? What happens with that? What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, ""Oh well, France is a liberal society."" But I lived in England for 18 years. I\'ve lived in France for about four, and I feel actually thrown back 20 years, living in France. And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question: What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema? There\'s a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means. I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me. My life started as a -- I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war. So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.', '09:08': ""(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother. Onicha: Yes, mama.

But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. So for me, the thought that we have all these children -- it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage, and Africa has to live with that. But I’m just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement.

We who are diplomats, we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states. And I can tell you, our agenda is full. There is trade, there is disarmament, there is cross-border relations."", '00:38': 'But the picture is changing, and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene. We loosely call them ""groups."" They may represent social, religious, political, economic, military realities. And we struggle with how to deal with them. The rules of engagement: how to talk, when to talk, and how to deal with them.', '01:03': ""Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today. You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict, the ones we used to read about. The red is modern conflict, conflicts within states. These are quite different, and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy. And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries. And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries. So in a way, it is everybody's business."", '01:45': ""Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years, recent years, is that very few of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily. They may have to be dealt with with military means, but they cannot be solved by military means. They need political solutions. And we, therefore, have a problem, because they escape traditional diplomacy. And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them. Plus, during the last decade, we've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous. After 9/11, either you were with us or against us. It was black or white. And groups are very often immediately label terrorists. And who would talk to terrorists? The West, as I would see it, comes out of that decade weakened, because we didn't understand the group. So we've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others."", '02:49': ""Now I'm not naive. You cannot talk to everybody all the time. And there are times you should walk. And sometimes military intervention is necessary. I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary. And my country relies on its security through military alliance, that's clear. But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict."", '03:16': 'Let us turn to Afghanistan. 10 years after that military intervention, that country is far from secure. The situation, to be honest, is very serious. Now again, the military is necessary, but the military is no problem-solver. When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister, I met the commander of ISAF, the international troops. And he told me that, ""This can be won militarily, minister. We just have to persevere."" Now four COM ISAF\'s later, we hear a different message: ""This cannot be won militarily. We need military presence, but we need to move to politics. We can only solve this through a political solution. And it is not us who will solve it; Afghans have to solve it."" But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001, 2002. They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues.', '04:17': ""Everybody seems to agree with that. It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago. Now everybody agrees. But now, as we prepare to talk, we understand how little we know. Because we didn't talk. We didn't grasp what was going on. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC, is talking to everyone, and it is doing so because it is neutral. And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk."", '04:52': 'My point is that you don\'t have to be neutral to talk. And you don\'t have to agree when you sit down with the other side. And you can always walk. But if you don\'t talk, you can\'t engage the other side. And the other side which you\'re going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree. Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process, ""You don\'t make peace with your friends, you make peace with your enemies."" It\'s hard, but it is necessary.', '05:22': ""Let me go one step further. This is Tahrir Square. There's a revolution going on. The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter. It will last for a long, long time. And who knows what it will be called in the end. That's not the point. The point is that we are probably seeing, for the first time in the history of the Arab world, a revolution bottom-up -- people's revolution. Social groups are taking to the streets. And we find out in the West that we know very little about what's happening. Because we never talk to the people in these countries. Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups, because they were terrorists. So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution, we find out how little we know."", '06:18': 'Right now, the discussion goes, ""Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood? Should we talk to Hamas? If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."" I think that is wrong. If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing. And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood, as we should, that they must respect minority rights, if we don\'t accept majority rights? Because they may turn out to be a majority. How can we escape [having] a double-standard, if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don\'t want to deal with the groups that are representative? How will we ever be interlocutors? Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups. But talking can be done in different ways. We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid. Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.', '07:21': ""There's a big array of the ways of dealing with this. So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come, we will further radicalization, I believe. We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel. And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy, if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states, there are some rewards on the other side. The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this."", '08:03': 'And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily. And the reason is what happened in South Africa: Nelson Mandela. When Mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity, if he had told his people, ""It\'s time to take up the arms, it\'s time to fight,"" he would have been followed. And I think the international community would have said, ""Fair enough. It\'s their right to fight."" Now as you know, Mandela didn\'t do that. In his memoirs, ""Long Road to Freedom,"" he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being, also being a human being. So he engaged a political process of dialogue, not as a strategy of the weak, but as a strategy of the strong. And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked. Now South African friends will know that was very painful.', '09:18': ""So what can we learn from all of this? Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments -- but it is very necessary. If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts, if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up, supported by technology, which is available to all, we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations. We have to connect with these profound changes."", '09:52': ""And what is dialogue really about? When I enter into dialogue, I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view, that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values. I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals. We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward. We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk, and sometimes you may need to fight. And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances. Sometimes you have to. But that strategy seldom takes you very far. The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue. And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy, not only between states, but also within states."", '10:49': 'We are seeing some new signs. We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently, by engaging with civil society. All of a sudden, NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans, but they were taking [them] into the negotiations, partly because they represented the victims of these weapons. And they brought their knowledge. And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up. This is perhaps a first element of a change. In the future, I believe, we should draw examples from these different illustrations, not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society.', '11:37': ""And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times, climate change. How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations, unless we are able to make civil society and people, not part of the problem, but part of the solution? It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations, but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization. It's crucial to understand, I believe, because of technology and because of globalization, societies from bottom-up."", '12:17': 'We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities. What is it that makes people trust each other, not only between states, but also within states? What is the legitimacy of diplomacy, of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups?', '12:47': 'The good thing is that we are not powerless. We have never had as many means of communication, means of being connected, means of reaching out, means of including. The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication. But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it. Now, I hope, in the coming years, that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving, among the Afghans, inside the Palestinian population, between the peoples of Palestine and Israel.', '13:36': 'And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world, we are not powerless. We need to improve the necessary skills, and we need the courage to use them. In my country, I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together, not as a government initiative, but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension.

Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, and will vote accordingly. What is the fairest way to conduct that vote?', '00:46': 'The most straightforward solution would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose the location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, or ""first past the post."" In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents than any other. And yet, most colonists would consider this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote really the fairest method?', '01:18': 'What if we tried a system like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes for first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences and cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone, the votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, making it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among their two least preferred options.', '02:22': 'Instead of using rankings, we could try voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners proceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North winning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have the votes to win, they can still skew the results in their favor. In the first round, they vote for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North from advancing. Thanks to this ""tactical voting"" by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily, despite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good if it incentivizes lying about your preferences?', '03:07': ""Maybe what we need to do is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: West versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference between the two. So that's West's 42 versus the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same for the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base wins the most times. Here, North wins three and South wins two. These are indeed the two most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being anyone’s least preferred choice."", '03:51': 'So does that make the Condorcet method an ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election with three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner.', '04:10': ""Over the decades, researchers and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been put into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering an unfair result."", '04:27': 'It turns out that our intuitive concept of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions that may contradict each other. It doesn’t seem fair for some voters to have more influence than others. But nor does it seem fair to simply ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system. In fact, mathematical proofs have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically desirable criteria. So while we often think of democracy as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits from the different ways of counting them.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I study health systems in these countries. And one of the major gaps in care, almost across the board, is access to safe surgery. Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place, and the safety of those surgeries that do happen, is anesthesia. And actually, it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments."", '00:34': ""Here, we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the US, or any other developed country. In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind. In order to operate, this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer. It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily. And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives."", '01:25': ""It's a pretty expensive machine. It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000. And perhaps most obviously, but also most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrates this -- it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity, of compressed oxygen, and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine. In other words, this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer."", '02:00': ""This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi. In this hospital, there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia, and she's qualified because she has 12, maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia. In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer. So when this machine breaks, the machines that they have to work with break, they've got to try and figure it out, but most of the time, that's the end of the road. Those machines go the proverbial junkyard. And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital."", '02:37': 'And finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong. This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid, one that goes down frequently. So it runs frequently, the entire hospital, just on a generator. And you can imagine, the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel. And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month. Similarly, compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury, and can often be out of stock for months or even a year.', '03:10': ""So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. It's not just inappropriate, it becomes really unsafe."", '03:28': ""One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago. And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case. A woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section to save her life and the life of her baby. And everything began pretty auspiciously. The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in. The nurse was there. She was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation. And everything began well until the power went out. And now in the middle of this surgery, the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case, which he can do -- he's got a headlamp. But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient, to keep her patient asleep. Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power. This routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced, and others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy. And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event; this happens across the developing world. 35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia."", '04:38': 'My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton, was living this reality. He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi, a teaching hospital. He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one, trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital. And after umpteen surgeries and, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy, he just said, ""That\'s it. I\'m done. That\'s enough. There has to be something better."" He took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them, I think that\'s the scientific term, and he started tinkering. He took one part from here and another from there, and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing.', '05:23': 'And what he came up with: was this guy. The prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine -- a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. Here it is, back at home at that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later, working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.', '05:45': ""Let me show you a little bit about how this machine works. Voila! Here she is. When you have electricity, everything in this machine begins in the base. There's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there. Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point. Essentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible, because eventually you're going to dilute it, essentially, with the gas. And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous. But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air. Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen. So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here, where it mixes with the anesthetic agent."", '06:38': ""Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs, it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it, but there's an oxygen sensor here -- that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered. Now if you don't have power, or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of a surgery, this machine transitions automatically, without even having to touch it, to drawing in room air from this inlet."", '07:03': ""Everything else is the same. The only difference is that now you're only working with 21 percent oxygen. Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game, because you only knew if you gave too little oxygen once something bad happened. But we've put a long-life battery backup on here. This is the only part that's battery backed up. But this gives control to the provider, whether there's power or not, because they can adjust the flows based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving the patient."", '07:30': ""In both cases, whether you have power or not, sometimes the patient needs help breathing. It's just a reality of anesthesia, the lungs can be paralyzed. And so we've just added this manual bellows. We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this."", '07:46': ""So it's a straightforward machine. I shudder to say simple; it's straightforward. And it's by design. You do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine, which is good because, in these rural district hospitals, you're not going to get that level of training. It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in."", '08:10': ""This is an incredibly rugged machine. It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts. And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver. And finally, it's affordable. This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier. So in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives, because it was designed for its environment, just like the first machine I showed you."", '08:50': ""But we're not content to stop there. Is it working? Is this the design that's going to work in place? Well, we've seen good results so far. This is in 13 hospitals in four countries, and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events. So we're thrilled. This really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive. But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals."", '09:22': ""So to do that, we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities, to gather data on the user interface, on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for, and ways we can enhance the device itself. One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for, and in a contained, safe environment, evaluating its effectiveness. We're then able to compare the results from that study with real-world experience, because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone, including the hospital where that emergency C-section happened."", '10:09': ""So I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that. I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health. And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it, until we don't have access to it, and then it becomes a gatekeeper. Who gets surgery and who doesn't? Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't? But you know, it's just one of so many ways that design, appropriate design, can have an impact on health outcomes. If more people in the health-delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries could start their design process, their solution search, from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital -- In other words, if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world, rather than the one that we wished existed -- we might just save a lot of lives."", '11:01': 'Thank you very much.', '11:02': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had no idea that at that moment, my life was going to change forever. While I was preparing my dog for the run, a man was finishing drinking at a bar, picked up his car keys, got into a car and headed south, or wherever he was.

And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth."", '00:57': 'What had happened is, he ran a red light and hit me and my dog.

Your aorta comes up behind your heart, it\'s your major artery -- and it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth. It foamed, and ... horrible things were happening to me.

I was wrapped in ice, and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.', '02:16': 'Eighteen months later, I woke up. I was blind, I couldn\'t speak and I couldn\'t walk. I was 64 pounds.

But who's counting?"", '03:16': '(Laughter)', '03:18': 'So eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go. They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through. Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover. So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home, here in Colorado. And I know all of you are scratching your head: ""A senior citizens\' home? What in the world are you going to do there?"" But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now, that\'s what a senior home has. So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had. The one advantage they had over most of you is wisdom, because they had a long life. And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.', '04:08': 'But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep. At that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.

So while Sally, the office manager, was teaching me to speak in the day -- it's hard, because when you're a kid, you take things for granted. You learn things unconsciously. But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out. So, I acted like a two-year-old, and refused to work."", '06:38': 'But the men had a better idea. They were going to make it fun for me.

And it\'s a picture we\'ve seen several times. Basically, ""Emergence"" was published on 9/11. I live right there in the West Village, so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us. We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn\'t taken it from somebody else.', '00:41': '(Laughter)', '00:43': ""And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density, of largely urban density, of connecting people and putting them together in one place, and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together."", '01:22': ""And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling, those towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons here was that density kills. And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being, probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings 110 stories above the ground. If they hadn't been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers, and you can see that very powerfully. And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call."", '02:03': ""And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy. And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know, a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond, which was located about 20 blocks away, north. And so I went out. And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) -- so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks. And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter, which was that the streets were completely alive with people."", '02:48': 'There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively. I walked up along Hudson Street -- where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in ""Emergence"" -- past the White Horse Tavern, that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death, and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids. And all the people who lived in the neighborhood, who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood, were all out there -- had them all open. People were out. There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways. And it was a beautiful urban day, and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. The city was there. All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating -- they were all on display there on those streets.', '03:35': ""And I thought, well, this is the power of a city. I mean, the power of the city -- we talked about cities as being centralized in space, but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail. If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero. I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there, was destroyed by the attacks, and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later, the city had never looked more alive. If you'd gone into the minds of the people, well, you would have seen a lot of trauma, and you would have seen a lot of heartache, and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover."", '04:16': ""But the system itself of this city was thriving. So I took heart in seeing that. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well, and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood? Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality? Well, there are some kind of executive decisions, but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody. Everybody contributes a little bit. No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood."", '05:03': 'Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood? Well, it was the whole city. The whole system kind of working on it, and everybody contributing a small little part. And this is increasingly what we\'re starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -- most of which weren\'t around, actually, except in very experimental things, when I was writing ""Emergence"" and when the book came out. So it\'s been a very optimistic time, I think, and I want to just talk about a few of those things. I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that\'s starting to emerge online right now.', '05:35': 'And the old one looked like this. This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it. It\'s some guy, it\'s a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who\'s interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and ""my hometown"" -- those are his links. But nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than ""Click here for a picture of my dog."" That is -- you know, there\'s no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.', '06:19': 'And, you know, I don\'t want to belittle that. That, in a sense -- to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday -- that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web: that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it, and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. But it\'s still a very one-to-one kind of relationship. There\'s one person putting up the link, and there\'s another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not. The new model is much more like this, and we\'ve already seen a couple of references to this. This is what happens when you search ""Steven Johnson"" on Google. About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough -- one of my great, kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for ""Steven Johnson."" There\'s some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots, I\'m happy to say.', '07:10': '(Laughter)', '07:11': ""And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this, but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. So there's this collective decision-making that's going on. This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web, and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place."", '07:57': ""Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this. There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati -- that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs. He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs, and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page? And you can get a list. This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority. You can also rank it by the latest posts."", '08:41': 'So when I was talking in ""Emergence,"" I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn\'t necessarily know that you were pointing to them. And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn\'t quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. Well, something like Technorati is supplying that. Now what\'s interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there\'s nothing artificial. He has this line where he says, you know, you\'re going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there. And he says, the link to one site didn\'t just grow on the other page ""like a tree fungus.""', '09:21': ""And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore. I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right-hand side of my page, and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes. That little list there would change. I wouldn't really be directly in control of it. So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense, wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there. Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. And there are all these interesting tools. Google does the Google Zeitgeist, which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in, and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google, so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing."", '10:06': ""There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist, which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news. The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia. Well, you know, we should expect to see that. That's not necessarily something we didn't know already. So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain, that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream -- the question is, are you finding out something new?"", '10:35': ""And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically, you take an abstract term, and you search Google for that term, and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name. So basically, the number of pages that mention this term, that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term. So you can do kind of interesting contests. Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. So Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference. Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add."", '11:15': '(Laughter)', '11:17': ""But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit. And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish. I had no idea. No, that's not true. (Laughter) I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish."", '11:33': '(Laughter)', '11:35': ""I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages, so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly. Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker. So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. So Gary Bauer is not too far behind -- has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection. And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So -- (Laughter) you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good. And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there."", '12:22': '(Laughter)', '12:27': ""Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that, I think it would be good next year. Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing, but this analysis some of you may have seen. It just came out. This is bursty words, looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere, so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off, that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s -- slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas. That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting. They're talking about slavery in 1860. 1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks. And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious. 1985, right at the center of the Reagan years -- that's, we're, there's, we've, it's."", '13:14': '(Laughter)', '13:16': 'Now, there\'s one way to interpret this, which is to say that ""emancipation"" and ""depression"" and ""recovery"" all have a lot of syllables. So you know, you can actually download -- it\'s hard to remember those. But seriously, actually, what you can see there, in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise, is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic -- contracting all those verbs. You know, 20 years before it was still, ""Ask not what you can do,"" but with Reagan, it\'s, ""that\'s where, there\'s Nancy and I,"" that kind of language. And so something we kind of knew, but you didn\'t actually notice syntactically what he was doing. I\'ll go very quickly. The question now -- and this is the really interesting question -- is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.', '14:07': ""And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago, and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs. It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs, and a long tail of blogs with very few links. So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links. Now this is a very interesting thing. It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man, one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard."", '14:43': 'And so the question is, ""Why is this happening?"" It\'s not being imposed by fiat from above. It\'s an emergent property of the blogosphere right now. Now, what\'s great about it is that people are working on -- within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. And basically, the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage. if you\'re the first site there, everybody links to you. If you\'re the second site there, most people link to you. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links, and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future, and then you get this kind of shape. And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on, literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece -- was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don\'t have a lot of links, that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.', '15:35': ""So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices. So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system. And it creates a kind of planned emergence. You're not totally in control, but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note -- is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. I hope it continues here. Thanks a lot.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, treeless desert between the towering Andes and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, and using them to build fishing boats.

He brings the herbs he gathered to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes from the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual to ward off the storms.', '02:34': 'Around lunchtime, the sprawling temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along the coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions— they’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed to do the trading, but shamans are an exception.

He puts on his ceremonial garb: red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth and vertebrae.

Many of them are Quexo’s friends from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans who would have cinnabar.', '03:32': 'He begins to panic.

Dodge,Educator,"{'00:14': 'How big was that fish you caught? This big? This big? This big? Without photographic evidence, there\'s nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that\'s been true since the dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them. To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn\'t until the mid 1800\'s that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is quite different than it used to be. Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn\'t tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish. For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can hold it up to say, ""The fish was exactly this big!""'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gorgeous photos show the hidden worlds that Gjerde and other lawyers are working to protect from trawling and trash-dumping, through smart policymaking and a healthy dose of PR.",0:15:31,15.51666667,400047,2010-11-19T14:03:13+00:00,"['global issues', 'law', 'mission blue', 'oceans', 'politics', 'science', 'global commons']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Kristina Gjerde,High seas policy advisor,"{'00:10': 'Today I\'m going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. It\'s a place of myth and legend. It\'s a place marked on ancient maps as ""here be monsters."" It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.', '00:48': 'We are talking about the high seas. The ""high seas"" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet. With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all. But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I\'m going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. We\'re going to voyage to some of these special places that we\'ve been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally, we\'re going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that\'s rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.', '01:56': ""So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue. To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent. This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas. It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case."", '03:03': ""So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community. Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules. And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify."", '03:47': ""What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that? Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed."", '04:35': 'So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. Instead of ""go anywhere, do anything you want,"" we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you\'re going and a duty to prevent significant harm. In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected. This does not mean that it\'s the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection. But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime. So I\'m looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia\'s wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.', '05:54': ""Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently."", '06:32': ""But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area."", '07:44': ""Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay. It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem. But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime."", '09:05': ""Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season. As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round."", '09:53': ""Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present. So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention. But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch."", '11:10': 'So what I\'d really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up. We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide. We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative. We\'ve heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects. It\'s provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that\'s going to be launched in October. So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it\'s also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. And fortunately, we\'ve been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us. We\'ve been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots. At the same time we\'re saying, ""Yes, we need more. We need to move forward.""', '12:34': ""But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean. We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing."", '13:32': ""So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas. But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management. Our species are ocean-basin-wide. Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization."", '14:52': ""So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote."", '15:19': 'So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.', '15:31': 'Thank you.', '15:33': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s made of armor, sequins and broken jewelry, and I was the first person to wear armor to Parliament since Oliver Cromwell banned it in the 17th century.

Were you exposed to it? Or was it trial and error? As child rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman said, ""You can\'t be what you can\'t see."" Fortunately, we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem.', '00:29': 'For the past two years, I\'ve been developing an extended reality program that enables middle school students from across the country to take on the role of a marine biologist -- even if they\'ve never seen the ocean. As one seventh grader who recently completed our program said, ""I could see myself as a scientist, because I enjoyed this game.""', '00:51': 'This feedback really excited me, because too few students do see themselves as scientists. A 2014 study showed that 57 percent of eighth- and ninth-grade students said, ""Science isn\'t me."" Coincidentally, also in 2014, I met Mandë Holford, a marine biochemist, and Lindsay Portnoy, an educational psychologist. The three of us shared a passion for getting students excited by and comfortable with science. We thought about how we could give children the most realistic experience of a scientific career. We discussed the research; it showed that students felt comfortable taking risks when playing games.', '01:32': 'So the three of us started an educational games company to bring science to life. Virtual reality seemed like a low-cost way of increasing access. In addition, academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention. This was perfect for us, as we wanted to be in schools so that we could reach the most number of students possible, particularly students who have been underrepresented in science.', '01:59': ""So, with funding from the National Science Foundation, we began developing our extended reality program that combined virtual reality with personalized digital journaling. We worked with teachers while developing it to ensure that it would fit seamlessly into existing curricula and empower teachers to use cutting-edge technology in their classroom. We designed the virtual reality for Google Cardboard, which requires only a smartphone and a 10 dollar VR viewer made of cardboard. With this inexpensive headset, students are transported to an underwater expedition. Students use their digital journal to write down their notes, to answer questions, to construct models and to develop hypotheses. Students then go to the virtual world to test their hypotheses and see if they're accurate, much as scientists go to the field in their careers. When students return to their digital journal, they share their observations, claims, reasoning and evidence. The students' written answers and virtual interactions are all updated live in an educator assessment dashboard, so that teachers can follow their progress and support them as needed."", '03:12': ""To give you a better sense, I'm going to show you a little bit of what students see. This is the virtual reality when they're underwater observing the flora and fauna. This is the digital journal where they're constructing their models based on this abiotic data to show what they expect to see. Here, they're supporting that with qualitative statements. And this is the educator dashboard that shows progress and enables [teachers] to see the students' answers as they go."", '03:42': ""When we were creating BioDive, again, we really wanted to focus on access, so we designed it to require only one phone for every four students. We also knew how collaborative science work is, so we constructed the experience to only be solved through collaborative teamwork, as each student is an expert in a different geographic location. Given that these children's brains are still developing, we limited each experience to last a maximum of two minutes. And finally, because we know the importance of repeated exposure for internalizing knowledge, we constructed BioDive to take place over five class periods."", '04:21': 'We started piloting BioDive in 2017 in 20 schools in New York and New Jersey. We wanted to see students as they were using this new technology. In 2019, now, we are now piloting in 26 states. What we have heard from teachers who have taught our program: ""It was a nice way to show ocean dynamics without the luxury of actually being there since we are in Ohio.""', '04:45': '(Laughter)', '04:46': '""It\'s pretty mind-blowing."" ""The students were totally engaged."" But what really gives us hope is what we\'re hearing from students. ""I liked how it felt like I was there."" ""It\'s interactive and a fun way to learn."" ""It really gave me realistic examples of how these organisms appear."" ""I could see myself as a scientist because it seems really fun.""', '05:08': ""Our feedback wasn't always so positive. When we began developing, we started off by asking students what they liked, what they didn't like and what they found confusing. Eventually we began asking what they wished they could do. Their feedback gave us concrete items to build in to be sure that we were including student voices in what we were designing. Overall, what we have learned is that this is the beginning of a new platform for giving students both voice and ownership in deciding how they want to have impact in their careers."", '05:43': 'We focused on science, because we know we need scientists to help us solve our current and future challenges. But virtual reality could support students in any area. How could we support students in exploring all of their desires with these eye-opening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources? Could we create VR for inexpensive headsets that lets them be immersed in oral literature or in critical moments of human history?', '06:13': ""Extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory of our children's lives and lead them to careers they never imagined by giving them the chance to see what they can be."", '06:25': 'Thank you.', '06:26': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A film also exists in time; it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something, or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas. And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey. So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes, and we meet people along the way. We only meet them once. They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey. It's something like life, that once you get in it you can't get out."", '00:54': ""There are two clips I want to show you, the first one is a kind of hodgepodge, its just three little moments, four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight. It's not the way they occur in the film, because they are part of much larger scenes. They play off each other in a wonderful way. And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life. I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental, and perhaps not planned at all. And those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He built the capital over there. And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen -- it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew. We were the first film crew in there."", '01:44': ""So you'll see images of this remarkable building. A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year. It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding, people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads, dumping them in the forms. It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. It took as long as the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished. He died in 1974. The building was finished in 1983. So it continued on for many years after he died. Think about that when you see that building, that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished."", '02:32': 'And that really struck me about my father, in the sense that he had such belief that somehow, doing these things giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it, even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point, and the construction stopped totally and he kept working, because he felt, ""Well when the war is done they\'ll need this building.""

You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him. I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life, you know? I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane, or I'm going to die in an airport, or die jogging without an identification on me. I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died.

He is not a political man, but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy, from where we can rise. In that way it is so relevant. He didn't care for how much money this country has, or whether he would be able to ever finish this building, but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.

In social aspect of his life he was just like a child, he was not at all matured. He could not say no to anything, and that is why, that he cannot say no to things, we got this building today. You see, only that way you can be able to understand him. There is no other shortcut, no other way to really understand him. But I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him, that's why, he has given love for us. He could not probably give the right kind of love for you, but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love, that is important. You have to understand that.

Do you want to try? Why don't we stop breathing together for, let's say, even 10 seconds. Is that OK? Let's do it. Get ready ... OK, now!"", '00:48': ""Oof, difficult, isn't it?"", '00:51': ""Well, this is an incredible number that will again take your breath away: seven. Seven what? Seven million premature deaths a year caused by exposure to the bad quality of the air we breathe. Imagine -- it's like more than the entire population of my dear Madrid will be wiped out in one year."", '01:19': 'And you may ask: Has this information been disclosed? Has this information been publicized, distributed? Well, yes. We have at the moment more than 70,000 scientific papers examining the relationship between air pollution and our health, and the global media has been regularly covering this issue. In fact, in a relatively short period of time, we have come to know that air pollution is having a negative impact on almost all our major organs.', '01:58': ""Let's start by the lungs. When we think about air pollution, we always think about the lungs. In fact, every time we take a breath, we are inhaling toxic pollutants, and our poor pink and lovely lungs are suffering all of that."", '02:19': ""Over the last 10 years, we have put together a lot of knowledge about what's happened to that, but let me tell you first what is air pollution. OK, air pollution is a very complex mixture of solid particles, liquid droplets and gaseous chemicals. Imagine all of this mixture that might come from sources like household fuel burning or industry or traffic or many other indoor and outdoor sources. And, of course, different sources of pollution will make different mixtures of pollutants. The point is that all of these toxins, they can be combined in different ways. Let's take, for instance, the particulate matter, the PM. It can be a mixture that will include -- look at the cocktail here -- soil and road dust, sea salt, toxic metals, diesel smog, nitrates and sulfates, and all of this toxic poison, this delicious cocktail, is going through our lungs every day, and we are constantly exposed to this air pollution because we cannot stop breathing. I mean, we can do it for 10 seconds, but no more than that. We cannot stop breathing and, in addition, we need, every day, around 10,000 liters of air."", '03:58': ""So we said that we have seven million deaths caused by air pollution every year. Are we panicking? Are we keeping calm? Are we declaring a national disaster, a global emergency? Well, no, and in fact I'm asking myself this question every day: What is happening? But here is something that maybe will force us to react more quickly. Air pollution is not just affecting our lungs. It's affecting our brain as well."", '04:33': 'This is our brain. Beautiful. We all have it. We all need it. Hopefully, we all use it --', '04:43': '(Laughter)', '04:44': ""some more than others. And in the last 10 years of history, the research about the relationship between air pollution and our brain's health has been increased dramatically, so maybe now our brain is going up in smoke. But let me tell you the evidence, what we know so far about air pollution in our brain."", '05:08': ""First, there is an emerging body of evidence regarding the potential harmful effects of air pollutants into our central nervous system. But let's go back to the toxic particles. Remember? We left them at the lungs, enjoying life, polluting everything. But now the smallest of them, they can cross into the bloodstream, and from the bloodstream, pumped by the heart, they can reach the whole body, threatening every organ, including the brain. We used to say that air pollution has no borders, and it's true as well within our bodies, because air pollutants will cross the placental barrier and reach the fetus and alter the cerebral cortex of our children even before they take their first breath."", '06:06': ""Second, several studies have suggested that both prenatal and early childhood long-term exposure to air pollution will have a negative influence on neural development, will have lower cognitive test outcomes, and there will be an influence as well, a negative influence, on some behavioral disorders like autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In addition to that, some evidence found that exposing our children's and young adults' brains for a long time to particulate matter will cause some reactions like brain inflammation, altering the neural response and [also] leading to the influence of more protein plaques that are accumulating, and those can increase the risks for diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's."", '07:15': ""Ironic, isn't it: we are investing in our children's future, we are sending them to school every day to expand their minds, the society is investing in their education, and yet the air they breathe while waiting for the school bus is influencing negatively the development of their brain."", '07:40': ""Let's go to the third: What about adults? According to recent scientific evidence, long-term exposure to particulate matter will cause a cognitive decline in study participants as they age. And not only that, if you expose them to long-term, very fine particulate matter, their brain will age more rapidly, and they will have higher odds of having small, silent strokes."", '08:17': 'The last one -- and I will not give you more evidence, because there is a ton of [it] -- some epidemiological studies in animal models have suggested that there might be an increased risk of dementia with sustained exposure to air pollutants.', '08:35': ""So, almost everybody is exposed to air pollution. Whether you live in a rural area or an urban area, whether you live in a high-income country or a low-income country, everybody's brains, including yours, are at risk."", '08:54': 'As a medical doctor, I have been dedicating the last more than 20 years now of my professional life to raise awareness about public health issues, public health risks, at the World Health Organization, and I know that the knowledge is there and the solutions as well. Sure, some places are more polluted than others, but this a global issue, and no individual, no city, no group, no country, no region will be able to solve it alone. We need very strong commitments and very strong action by everyone: civil society, private sector, even individuals. We all have a role to play. Yes, we need to influence the way we consume, the way we commute, the way we use our energy.', '09:52': 'And the good thing is that all of those solutions are available. The question is, if we postpone action by one day, there might be thousands of lives that we will lose, but if we postpone it by one year, we might be losing again seven million. So every policy maker, every politician, needs to be aware of the consequences on human health of postponing their decisions.', '10:23': ""In fact, this is not the first time in history that we are confronted with the risks of this invisible killer. This was London in 1952, and as was done in London in the '50s and the '60s, governments and cities, they need to take urgent action to stop the terrible impact of air pollution. Every politician must know that delaying what they call the tough actions, like reducing traffic in cities or investing in public transport and engaging in promoting cycling in cities, investing in renewable energy, promoting cleaner energy for cooking, cooling and transportation and heating are solutions that are very smart, because, in fact, they reduce emissions, they improve air quality in line with WHO standards, which are the standards that will protect ourselves."", '11:37': 'So in fact, all politicians that we need these very strong political commitments and political will from, but [we need] all of them now. Those who fail, who postpone action, they have been requested even to defend their position in court. And from now on, no politician will be able to say, ""I didn\'t know.""', '12:05': 'So the question here is: How many lives, loss of quality of life and losing our brain power are we ready to accept? If the answer is ""none,"" I will request that you, while our brains are still functioning, while we are still intelligent, please exercise your right, put pressure on your politicians and make sure that they take action to stop the sources of air pollution. This is the first thing we need to do to protect yourself and to protect our beautiful brain.', '12:41': 'Thank you very much.', '12:43': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit or narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there so much traffic?', '00:27': 'When traffic comes to a near standstill for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own, greater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic in the future.', '00:52': 'For a phantom traffic jam to form, there must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights that propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves can travel along a highway for miles.', '01:34': 'With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more.', '02:16': 'The instability is a positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up to stop-and-go traffic.', '02:41': 'Drivers tend not to realize they need to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having to brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic.', '03:11': 'In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good sense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles or roadway sensors might be able to counteract phantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen and prevent traffic waves.', '04:06': 'Traffic jams are not only a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bill Shillito shows us how to work with matrices, with tips for adding, subtracting and multiplying (but not dividing!).

In particular, though, some fields don\'t just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a ""matrix,"" and many of them hanging out together, ""matrices"". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let\'s get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can\'t divide them, but that\'s a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that\'s pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there\'s more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It\'s not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It\'s more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here\'s how it works. Let\'s say you have two matrices. Let\'s make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We\'ll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there\'s two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let\'s put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here\'s your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There\'s one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can\'t be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you\'re careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it\'s pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There\'s so much you can do with them. For example, let\'s say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let\'s say it\'s ""Math rules"". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you\'ve got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There\'s even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it\'s pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After receiving his ornate crown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, towering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers know that the first king of Haiti would also be its last.', '00:31': 'Enslaved at birth on the island of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being moved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s first encounter with violent revolution.', '00:53': 'There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately after the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, as Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s slaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity to fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels fought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces seeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose through the ranks, proving himself the equal of more experienced generals.', '01:29': 'By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated all of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the island as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte had assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore slavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— but the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, and left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son would share only a few years later.', '02:16': 'Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions in the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power alienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited a political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a Civil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as president of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south from Port-au-Prince.', '02:56': 'Pétion tried to stay true to the revolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after the United States. He even supported anti-colonial revolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared him to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth.', '03:13': 'Christophe, conversely, had more aggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while retaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with many foreign nations, including Great Britain and the United States, and pledged non-interference with their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case the French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe instituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, he crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an elegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their three remaining children.', '03:50': 'Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid development of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European artists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order to establish public education. But while the king was initially popular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an uncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian policies lost support, and his opponents to the south gained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally reached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke left him unable to govern, key members of his military defected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, the king committed suicide.', '04:38': 'Today, the traces of Christophe’s complicated history can still be found in the crumbling remains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation to permanently abolish slavery.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And then when you say children, they will pretty quickly agree with you.', '00:23': ""(Video): We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years."", '00:44': ""The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. There are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school. And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go."", '01:16': ""So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype, it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children, and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops. That's smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number."", '01:50': ""In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops. It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived."", '02:19': ""And suddenly, the kids have connected laptops. They've leapfrogged. The change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone, yes, there will be television. But the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages, so the children grow up with access to information, with a window into the rest of the world. Before, they were closed off."", '02:53': ""Interestingly enough, in other countries, it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years. It's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. Thirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them, and by the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop."", '03:31': 'Now what are some of the results? Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets. Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. They own the laptops. They take them home. And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother. And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write. Her mother had not gone to primary school. And this is such an inversion, and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change.', '04:29': ""So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops? Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No. The reason you want laptops is that the word is education, not laptop. This is an education project, not a laptop project. They need to learn learning. And then, just think -- they can have, let's say, 100 books. In a village, you have 100 laptops, each with a different set of 100 books, and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books. You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school."", '05:02': 'Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway. So we\'re once again doing ""Give One, Get One."" Last year, we ran a ""Give One, Get One"" program, and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free. And by being a zero-dollar laptop, we can go to countries that can\'t afford it at all. And that\'s what we did. We went to Haiti, we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mongolia. Places that are not markets, seeding it with the principles of saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc. And then we can actually roll out large numbers.', '05:52': ""So think of it this way: think of it as inoculating children against ignorance. And think of the laptop as a vaccine. You don't vaccinate a few children. You vaccinate all the children in an area.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less than a century later, people repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts insisted they wouldn’t catch on.', '00:30': 'Of course, we can’t predict exactly what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change in ourselves. Three psychologists documented our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment.', '01:17': 'The researchers recruited over 7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics had been ten years before. The other half described those features in their present selves, and predicted what they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated the degree of change each participant reported or predicted.', '01:49': 'For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which 18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change came up short compared to the changes their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less than younger people on the whole, they underestimated their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life, the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk of our personal change is behind us.', '02:53': 'One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, there’s no real way to predict what our preferences will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult to make any long-term plans.', '03:34': 'So the end of history illusion applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things are now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately, there are countless records to remind us that the world does change, sometimes for the better.

See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer, and when I was growing up, he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go-kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day, he came home, when I was about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, we were going to build ... a robot."", '00:59': ""A robot. Now, I was thrilled about this, because at school, there was a bully named Kevin, and he was picking on me, because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this, so I could introduce Kevin to my robot."", '01:16': '(Laughter)', '01:17': '(Robot noises)', '01:27': '(Laughter)', '01:28': ""But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind."", '01:32': '(Laughter)', '01:33': 'See, he owned a chromium-plating company, and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this, that could basically do the heavy lifting.', '01:49': ""But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted, either. He and I worked on it for several years, but it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later, he was diagnosed with cancer."", '02:13': ""You see, what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time, and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of 45. I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college, I decided to study engineering, like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since."", '02:52': ""So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects, and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By 1993, I was a young professor at USC, and I was just building up my own robotics lab, and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it, and we would -- we were just amazed. We started playing with this, and that afternoon, we realized that we could use this new, universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab."", '03:34': ""So, rather than have it fight or do industrial work, we decided to build a planter, put the robot into the center of it, and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote some special scripts and software, so that anyone in the world could come in, and by clicking on the screen, they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden, remotely. And if you watered it a few times, we'd give you your own seed to plant."", '04:16': ""Now, this was an engineering project, and we published some papers on the system design of it, but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited, after the first year, by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria, to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say, it remained online there, 24 hours a day, for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history."", '04:50': 'Now, one day, I got a call out of the blue from a student, who asked a very simple but profound question. He said, ""Is the robot real?"" Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was, because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant, because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then, basically, index them in a computer system, such that it would appear that there was a real robot, when there wasn\'t. And the more I thought about it, I couldn\'t think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference.', '05:30': 'This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who\'s a world-renowned professor of philosophy, And I talked with him about this and he said, ""This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It\'s the issue of epistemology, the study of how do we know that something is true.""', '06:00': 'So he and I started working together, and we coined a new term: ""telepistemology,"" the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists, engineers and philosophers to write essays about this, and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student, who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true, this project taught me an important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions.', '06:33': ""Now, the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating, my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other, and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment? Like, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House?"", '06:55': '(Laughter)', '06:57': ""So, because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware, we decided that, rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party, we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele-Actor."", '07:15': 'We got a human, someone who\'s very outgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly, they could participate, by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go, and then conveying those to the Tele-Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up, I had about 30 seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said, ""The Tele-Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project, and people are watching her on their screens, there\'s cameras involved and there\'s microphones and she\'s got an earbud in her ear, and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next."" And he said, ""Wait a second. That\'s what I do.""', '08:38': '(Laughter)', '08:43': 'So he loved the concept, and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage, she walked right up to him, and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips.', '08:52': '(Laughter)', '08:54': ""We were totally surprised -- we had no idea that would happen. And he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return, and it worked out great. But that night, as we were packing up, I asked the Tele-Actor, how did the Tele-Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson? And she said they hadn't. She said, when she was just about to walk onstage, the Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do, and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural."", '09:23': '(Laughter)', '09:28': 'So, the success of the Tele-Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life, which is that, when in doubt, improvise.', '09:45': '(Laughter)', '09:48': ""Now, the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment -- chemotherapy treatments -- and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy, where tiny, radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done, as you can see here, is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage, which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered: what if we could modify the system, so that the needles could come in at different angles?"", '10:49': 'So we simulated this; we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs, and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation.', '11:04': ""So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins, and we're building a robot that has a number of -- it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here, they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel, this project also taught me an important lesson: When in doubt, when your path is blocked, pivot."", '11:43': ""And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing, and currently, all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering, what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks, and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery, and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster?"", '12:42': ""Now, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters, do incredibly interesting, beautiful acrobatics, by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task -- with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task, and we record the motions of the robot."", '13:22': ""So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot -- this is what the robot's path looks like, those three examples. Now, those are much better than what a novice like me could do, but they're still jerky and imprecise."", '13:41': ""So we record all these examples, the data, and then go through a sequence of steps. First, we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory, that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations -- they're all noisy and imperfect -- and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot, we observe what happens, then we adjust the controls, using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results, adjust the controls again, and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds."", '14:42': ""And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory, and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask, at 10 times the speed of a human. So this project also, because of its involved practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice."", '15:30': ""So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays, high school students can build robots, like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build."", '15:50': ""But, it's very -- now ... And now, I have a daughter, named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots, too. Maybe it runs in the family."", '16:04': '(Laughter)', '16:06': ""I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work, and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them."", '16:19': ""Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems, but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in, the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations, the devices we dream about, can inspire us to be better humans."", '16:55': 'Thank you.', '16:56': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do you find it beautiful? Is it creative? Now, would you change your answers if you learned the composer was this robot? Believe it or not, people have been grappling with the question of artificial creativity, alongside the question of artifcial intelligence, for over 170 years. In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician considered the world's first computer programmer, wrote that a machine could not have human-like intelligence as long as it only did what humans intentionally programmed it to do. According to Lovelace, a machine must be able to create original ideas if it is to be considered intelligent. The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001, proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea. A machine can pass this test if it can produce an outcome that its designers cannot explain based on their original code. The Lovelace Test is, by design, more of a thought experiment than an objective scientific test. But it's a place to start. At first glance, the idea of a machine creating high quality, original music in this way might seem impossible. We could come up with an extremely complex algorithm using random number generators, chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic to generate a sequence of musical notes in a way that would be impossible to track. But although this would yield countless original melodies never heard before, only a tiny fraction of them would be worth listening to. With the computer having no way to distinguish between those which we would consider beautiful and those which we won't. But what if we took a step back and tried to model a natural process that allows creativity to form? We happen to know of at least one such process that has lead to original, valuable, and even beautiful outcomes: the process of evolution. And evolutionary algorithms, or genetic algorithms that mimic biological evolution, are one promising approach to making machines generate original and valuable artistic outcomes. So how can evolution make a machine musically creative? Well, instead of organisms, we can start with an initial population of musical phrases, and a basic algorithm that mimics reproduction and random mutations by switching some parts, combining others, and replacing random notes. Now that we have a new generation of phrases, we can apply selection using an operation called a fitness function. Just as biological fitness is determined by external environmental pressures, our fitness function can be determined by an external melody chosen by human musicians, or music fans,  to represent the ultimate beautiful melody. The algorithm can then compare between our musical phrases and that beautiful melody, and select only the phrases that are most similar to it. Once the least similar sequences are weeded out, the algorithm can reapply mutation and recombination to what's left, select the most similar, or fitted ones, again from the new generation, and repeat for many generations. The process that got us there has so much randomness and complexity built in that the result might pass the Lovelace Test. More importantly, thanks to the presence of human aesthetic in the process, we'll theoretically generate melodies we would consider beautiful. But does this satisfy our intuition for what is truly creative? Is it enough to make something original and beautiful, or does creativity require intention and awareness of what is being created? Perhaps the creativity in this case is really coming from the programmers, even if they don't understand the process. What is human creativity, anyways? Is it something more than a system of interconnected neurons developed by biological algorithmic processes and the random experiences that shape our lives? Order and chaos, machine and human. These are the dynamos at the heart of machine creativity initiatives that are currently making music, sculptures, paintings, poetry and more. The jury may still be out as to whether it's fair to call these acts of creation creative. But if a piece of art can make you weep,  or blow your mind, or send shivers down your spine, does it really matter who or what created it?""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He shows how we can restore more of our oceans to this healthy, balanced state, and the powerful ecological and economic benefits of doing so.",0:18:42,18.7,388215,2010-05-12T08:52:00+00:00,"['economics', 'fish', 'mission blue', 'oceans', 'science', 'marine biology', 'coral reefs']","['Deutsch', 'Eesti keel', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Enric Sala,Marine ecologist,"{'00:09': ""I'm going to tell you two things today: One is what we have lost, and two, a way to bring it back. And let me start with this. This is my baseline: This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish, bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae. Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain. Now, if an alien came to earth -- let's call him Joe -- what would Joe see? If Joe jumped in a coral reef, there are many things the alien could see. Very unlikely, Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef, a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles, manatees, groupers, turtles, etc. So, probably, what Joe would see would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture. Here we have the extreme with dead corals, microbial soup and jellyfish. And where the diver is, this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now, with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals, lots of bacteria, and where the large animals are gone. And this is what most marine scientists have seen too. This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems."", '01:35': ""So I'm going to get us all on a time machine, and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like. And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands, where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions. This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited, unfished, pristine islands and a few inhabited islands. So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people. Most of the reefs are dead, most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae -- and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them. We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005. We didn't see a single shark. This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore."", '02:31': ""Let's move the dial a little bit to the past. Fanning Island, 2,500 people. The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish. This is what many divers would consider paradise. This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. And many people think this is really, really beautiful, if this is your baseline. If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll, where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago, the corals are doing better and there are sharks. You can see sharks in every single dive. And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs. But then, if we shift the dial 200, 500 years back, then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous, forming spectacular structures, and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing, where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive."", '03:24': 'What have we learned from these places? This is what we thought was natural. This is what we call the biomass pyramid. If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them, this is what we would expect. Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores, the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae. Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish, the little animals floating in the water. And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores, and a lower biomass of top head, or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers. But this is a consequence. This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs.', '04:03': ""When we went to pristine reefs, we realized that the natural world was upside down; this pyramid was inverted. The top head does account for most of the biomass, in some places up to 85 percent, like Kingman Reef, which is now protected. The good news is that, in addition to having more predators, there's more of everything. The size of these boxes is bigger. We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers, more biomass of herbivores, too, like these parrot fish that are like marine goats. They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen, they eat, and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish. Not only do these places -- these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish, but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons, up to 20, 25 per square meter. These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world, and they filter the water; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens."", '05:02': ""But still, now we have global warming. If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness, this is great. But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. So how are these fish, these predators going to help? Well, what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino, year '97, '98, the water was too warm for too long, and many corals bleached and many died. In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down, where the large animals are gone, the corals have not recovered. In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered. But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed. And the fish have grazed the algae, so the turf of algae is a little lower. Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores, and the dead corals are clean, and the corals are coming back. And when you go to the pristine side, did this ever bleach? These places bleached too, but they recovered faster. The more intact, the more complete, [and] the more complex your food web, the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events. And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure. We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming."", '06:31': ""So if we have to reset the baseline, if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left, how can we do it? Well, there are several ways. One very clear way is the marine protected areas, especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life. And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean. This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid. And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV, with all this richness and abundance and diversity. And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas, and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea. But, little did I know, until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve. And this is what I saw, lots of fish."", '07:17': 'After a few years, between five and seven years, fish come back, they eat the urchins, and then the algae grow again. So you have this little algal forest, and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae, mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish, so that the system recovers. And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve, is only 94 hectares, and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy, 20 times more than fishing, and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue. So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem.', '08:00': 'So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do. These places, when we protect them, if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens. The number of species increases 21 percent; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve. This is very substantial. The size of organisms increases a third, so your fish are now this big. The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter, increases almost 170 percent. And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change -- 4.5 times greater biomass on average, just after five to seven years. In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves.', '08:40': ""So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do? They reproduce. That's population biology 101. If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die, they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example. These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile, and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom. Outside the reserve, you cannot even detect this. One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant. So these organisms reproduce, the little larvae juveniles spill over, they all spill over, and then people can benefit from them outside too. This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper. Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve, and the closer you get to the reserve, the more fish you have. So the fishermen are catching more. You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. So there is spill over; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them, while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience."", '09:51': ""So what we have now -- or a world without reserves -- is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit. Reserves are like savings accounts. We have this principal that we don't touch; that produces returns, social, economic and ecological. And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves, this is like compound interest. Two examples, again, of how these reserves can benefit people. This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya, fishing over a series of years, in a place where there is no protection; it's a free-for-all. Once the most degrading fishing gear, seine nets, were removed, the fishermen were catching more. If you fish less, you're actually catching more. But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that, the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected."", '10:50': ""Another example: Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef. This is grouper sex, and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week. They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare, in one aggregation. Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them. When I went there for the first time in 2000, there were only 3,000 groupers left. And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year. So we did a simple analysis, and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year, your fishery is going to collapse very quickly. And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct. It happened in many places around the Caribbean. And they would make 4,000 dollars per year, total, for the entire fishery, several fishing boats. Now, if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut, if we brought just 20 divers one month per year, the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time."", '12:02': ""So how much of this do we have? If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have? And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean's protected. We're getting closer to one percent now, thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago, and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing. Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected. The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience."", '12:31': ""Now, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost? Well, let's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing: 35 billion dollars per year. Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices. Well, there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing. People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing. A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits."", '13:14': ""So how can we do that? If it's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people, why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean? And how can we reach that goal? Well, there are two ways of getting there. The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago. The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict, where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low. And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this."", '13:52': ""But what about the rest of the coast of the world, where people live and make a living out of fishing? Well, there are three main reasons why we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves: The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do, and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area, even if it's small. Second, the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it. It's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources."", '14:33': ""Which takes us to the third reason, why we don't have many more reserves, is that the funding models have been wrong. NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas, usually. So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money, and this is not sustainable. So the solutions are just fixing these three issues. First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now. It's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits. Second, we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized, so conservation efforts don't depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities, like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places. And third, and very important, we need to develop new business models. The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable. We really need to develop models, business models, where coastal conservation is an investment, because we already know that these marine reserves provide social, ecological and economic benefits."", '15:57': ""And I'd like to finish with one thought, which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean. There has been a lot of competition in the past, and we need to develop a new model of partnership, truly collaborative, where we are looking for complementing, not substituting. The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. So let's do that. Thank you very much."", '16:25': '(Applause)', '16:33': 'Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric.', '16:35': 'Enric Sala: Thank you.', '16:38': 'CA: That was a masterful job of pulling things together. First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid, showing 85 percent biomass in the predators, that seems impossible. How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent?', '16:54': ""ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears of a watch, a big one and a small one. The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast. That's basically it. The animals at the lower parts of the food chain, they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs. Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years. They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism; and, basically, they just maintain their biomass. So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving. They are like capacitors of the system."", '17:28': ""CA: That's very fascinating. So, really, our picture of a food pyramid is just -- we have to change that completely."", '17:34': 'ES: At least in the seas. What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti, with five lions per wildebeest. And on land, this cannot work. But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure. We think this is universal. But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently.', '17:56': ""CA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing. You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies. It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well. If the world was a smarter place, we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars. We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something."", '18:21': 'ES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars. So again, one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices.', '18:34': ""CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. So thank you for those numbers. The last one's a personal question. A lot of the experience of people here who've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse, depressing. Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back."", '18:59': ""ES: It is a spiritual experience. We go there to try to understand the ecosystems, to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know. But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about, where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature, of raw nature. And there, only there, you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem. And if it were not for these places that show hope, I don't think I could continue doing this job. It would be just too depressing."", '19:36': 'CA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you.', '19:40': 'ES: Thank you very much.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But one thing is clear. In the last 100 years alone, our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America -- our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so, how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing."", '01:00': 'So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating ""you are here,"" I\'m trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology, and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the -- excuse me, it\'s fairly blatant -- is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools.', '01:58': 'So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster. So, albeit a very small creature and very modest, this creature is incredible, because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures. It can grow; you can grow it; and -- did I mention? -- it\'s quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called ""oyster-tecture."" And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now.', '02:46': ""Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with."", '03:44': ""When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map, there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept, harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water."", '04:36': ""So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way, I think. Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster. And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again, we got the short end of the deal there. (Laughter) Finally, oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many, many species depend on them."", '05:45': ""So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive."", '06:29': ""How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that -- the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing -- it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope, you ask? It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. (Laughter) So in the studio, rather than drawing, we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change."", '07:35': 'It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end, what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century -- an amphibious park, if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water, and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring.', '08:13': 'Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: this is the word ""flupsy"" -- it\'s short for ""floating upwelling system."" And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them. So rather than having 10 oysters, you have 10,000 oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here\'s the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines -- the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef.', '09:05': ""I get asked two questions about this project. One is: why isn't it happening now? And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters? And the answer is: not yet, they're working. But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster."", '09:23': 'To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future.', '09:43': 'Thank you.', '09:45': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As simple as it sounds, it's really not that easy to find."", '00:25': ""After a brief stint as an English teacher, I went to law school and ended up becoming an attorney at a big law firm here in New York City. Like most Americans, for the next two, three years, I was holding on to my job for dear life, working really late hours at a job that I thought maybe I was good at but certainly not one that I really loved. I then came upon the epiphany that it takes years if not tens of thousands of hours to get really good at something. I really didn't have a lot of time to waste."", '00:49': ""This talk isn't for those looking to quit their job because they don't like their boss or they had a long day at work. This is for those that are ready to make the completely scary leap into a brand-new career. So as you think about making a career change, here are a few tips I hope you consider and a few things I've picked up along the way."", '01:05': ""First, there's three things to think about before you're ready to move on. Number one: professional life is about learning. If you're not even interested in learning anymore, that's a huge red flag that there might not be a future for you in that industry."", '01:17': 'Number two: career changes are often gut-driven. If you constantly have sleepless nights where you\'re wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking, ""Oh, man. I can\'t live with myself if I never try to make this change or if I don\'t even actually investigate it,"" then trust your gut. It might be time for that career change.', '01:33': ""On the flip side, one reason to not move on is short-term pain. If you don't like your boss or people at the office are grating on you, that's actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career, because when you do change a career, you generally have to start from the bottom, and you'll probably feel a lot of short-term pain, whether it's through a lack of salary or lack of a title. Pain at any job is inevitable."", '01:53': 'So now you\'re convinced that it\'s time to change your career. Then there\'s three things to do immediately. First: network, network, network. No one ever builds a career without a good mentor or a good support network. What I mean by networking is getting all the great advice that you can possibly get. Technology has made it so simple to reach out to new people to say, ""Hey, I\'m thinking about making a career change. Do you have just five minutes to chat with me?"" That passion and that hunger and that ability to be a sponge really attracts awesome mentors and people willing to give you their time to give you some good advice. So go out there and meet new people.', '02:27': ""The second thing you need to do immediately is shore up your finances. The reality is, when you change your career, you'll either start with a job with a lower title or lower pay or maybe even no pay, especially if you're starting your own business. So going out there and making sure your finances are in order to make the transition less painful is really, really important. For me personally, as I made the transition from being an attorney over to a video game creator, I wanted to have at least six to 12 months of personal runway in the bank. Six to 12 months might not be the right number for you, but be honest with yourself on what that number should be."", '02:59': ""Number three, if you're not ready to make the full jump right at this moment, then get your side hustle on. Side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization that's in the new industry you want to go into, could be starting your business part-time on the weekends. It's a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something."", '03:16': ""So you're ready to make the move or maybe you already made the move. Here are three things you should think about doing, right now. One: do not -- I repeat -- do not burn bridges. You spent years building those bridges, why burn them now? The world is such a small place, especially with all these online platforms, that, believe me, you will see these people again and probably in the most inopportune times."", '03:37': ""Number two: take stock of what you've learned in your previous career or careers. Most likely, a lot of those things are really applicable to your new job and your new career, whether it's interacting with people, playing on a team or dealing with jerks and assholes. All those things are really universally applicable. You'll find jerks no matter what industry you're in; no one's immune to it, everyone's got to figure it out, and you probably know how to do it already."", '04:01': ""Lastly, when you start your new job, you're going to be nervous. But don't worry, take a deep breath, because this is what I want to tell you: you're part of a new team now, and everyone around you is rooting for your success, because your success is their success. So welcome to your new career.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our political, ethnic, religious, and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self and our social communities.', '02:38': 'But this becomes a problem when the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team commit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated to maintain a positive relationship with their group than perceive the world accurately.', '03:21': 'This behavior is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies that aren’t grounded in truth or reason.', '03:53': 'This problem isn’t new— political identities have been around for centuries. But studies show that partisan polarization has increased dramatically in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering geographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas from people with similar views.', '04:24': 'Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been presented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying to persuade someone else, affirming their values and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive.', '05:06': 'We still have a long way to go before solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based decisions about our shared reality.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a curator of architecture and design; I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity, because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great, because it seems like every time I change jobs."", '00:35': 'And what I\'m going to do today is I\'m going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I\'m working on, which is called ""Design and the Elastic Mind."" The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved, but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at.', '01:05': ""If you think about your life today, you go every day through many different scales, many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people, you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic, others are a little slower, others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear, little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have, these kinds of discomforts that we have, and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know, we really need, we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic, and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers, but it's also scientists."", '02:16': ""And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview, I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women -- and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know, Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard -- what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest, this real passion for design."", '02:55': ""So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up, atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers, just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine -- that's now a multimedia company, you might know it -- we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant. And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation, I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language, and now we're already at the point that they collaborate."", '03:47': ""Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York, and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists, and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now, just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance, have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work, because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts, not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins -- not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms"", '04:44': ""at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails, and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very, very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell -- everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate."", '05:16': 'Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed -- he calls them ""typosperma."" He\'s thinking -- of course it\'s all a concept -- of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa, I don\'t know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter) I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.', '05:46': ""So, tissue design. In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be? When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like? So this particular student, James King, went around the beautiful English countryside, picked the best, best cow that he could see, and then put her in the MRI machine. Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat -- of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker, but you know, in the future it could be made better -- which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find."", '06:44': 'Instead, this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally. So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.', '07:00': ""This is SymbioticA, and they've been working -- they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat -- and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat. It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future."", '07:18': 'One of the most important topics of the show -- you know, as anything in our life today, we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints, and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often: we change resolution of screens, and we\'re not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably. So you go, even in the exhibition, from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data -- the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is ""Human vs. Chimps"" -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here\'s the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized with all the go-to, go-back-to, also made into a beautiful choreography.', '08:11': 'And then also graphs by scientists, this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations, otherwise they\'re afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface. It\'s only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first ""pretty"" -- if we can say so -- scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design. You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child, is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So, the more the merrier. The more computers, the stronger the signal, and children work on the interface so that it\'s all based on doing things together, tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future, and this is chosen as an example.', '09:21': ""Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together, and at the same time how these small objects, like the Walkman first and then the iPod, create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod."", '09:54': ""And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial, maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature, and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here, Social Tele-presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit, but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear], so if you're too shy to be really at the date, you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you."", '10:43': ""Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are, I think, bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling. It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very, very fragile, and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins. Techniques became better -- not only carving but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins, whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger, to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair, but you know what? One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home, customize your chair. You know, companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner"", '11:56': ""and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous, not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process, but also no tracking, no warehousing, no wasted materials. Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine -- you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles, which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in."", '12:44': 'Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big, and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger, we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also, we do it in order to share with other people. Again, this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So, various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way.', '13:24': 'This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment -- the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense, and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer -- bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies, in this case, pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer.', '13:59': 'Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don\'t design objects, products, things that we\'re going to actually use, but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based. They\'re still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It\'s Dunne and Raby, ""All the Robots."" Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us, and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room, and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down. So it\'s really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and ""Accessories for Lonely Men"": the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup, what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there\'s another one that breathes on your neck. There\'s another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it\'s just this idea of what we really miss in life.', '15:19': ""Elio Caccavale: he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation, and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees, and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads, in-vitro -- there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now."", '15:57': ""One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life, even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning, and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures, you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have, you know, Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive."", '16:39': 'And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, ""AfterLife."" It\'s the idea that some people don\'t believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death, they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them, and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever. It\'s quite amazing how these things can make you smile, can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes. But I\'m hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that one sister is 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set of ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French than the other?', '00:34': 'Tests like these rely on our DNA to answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually can’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great at answering some questions, like who your parents are, but can provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors from a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where our DNA comes from in the first place.', '01:06': 'Each person’s DNA consists of about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes— 46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount of information, but 99% of our genome is shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything distinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize less than 1% of that 1%.', '01:40': 'One chromosome in each pair comes from each parent. These halves join at conception: when a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, combine. The story of our ancestry becomes muddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes in a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes of every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair swap some sections. This process is called recombination, and it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes that are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely in each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different not only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA from each parent, but going further back things get more complicated.', '02:54': 'Without recombination, you would get 1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, and so on, but because recombination happens every generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed an ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented in your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come from each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, that number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high— or it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more ancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply more represented in her DNA.', '03:51': 'But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA of the sisters\' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes of deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results are based on a comparison to the DNA of people living in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, or combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences that appear in specific places. The sister deemed ""more French"" shares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these shared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France.', '04:40': 'It’s important to note that results are based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples are barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people not represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove race or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, your results might change.', '05:11': 'Looking further back, you may get a result like 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate species from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% of our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things.', '06:08': 'Looking for traces of our ancestry in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things with 100% certainty.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can, and actually is changing the world, and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers, a Monty Python type of sketch. Here it is."", '00:24': ""It is December 15, 2010. Somebody gives you a bet: you will look at a crystal ball, and you will see the future; the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. OK, curiosity killed the cat, you take the bet, you look at the crystal ball. One hour later, you're sitting in a building of the national TV, in a top show, and you tell the story. Before the end of 2011, Ben Ali, and Mubarak, and Gaddafi would be down, and prosecuted. Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged, or already on their knees. Osama bin Laden would be dead, and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague."", '01:05': 'Now, the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face. And then, on top of it you add: ""And thousands of young people from Athens, Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice, claiming they are inspired by Arabs.""', '01:20': 'Next thing you know, two guys in white appear, they give you the strange t-shirt, take you to the nearest mental institution. So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power.', '01:39': 'Well, people power has been there for a while. It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India, it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle. It helped a local, Lech Walesa, to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland, and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.', '01:57': ""So what's new in it? What seems to be very new, which is the idea I would like to share with you today, is that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle. If this is true, we can help these movements."", '02:16': ""Well, the first one - analytic skills. I'll try where it all started in the Middle East. And for so many years, we were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East. It was looking like the frozen region. Literally a refrigerator. And there were only two types of meal there. Steak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship, or a potato, which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies. And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened, and millions of young, mainly secular people stepped out to do the change. Guess what - they didn't watch the demographics. What is the average age of an Egyptian? 24. How long was Mubarak in power? 31. So, this system was just obsolete, they expired. And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning, and understood that power lies in their hands. The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what? The same Generation Y, with their rules, with their tools, with their games, and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me. I'm 38 now. And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe? It seems that Generation Y is coming."", '03:31': 'Now, let me set another example. I\'m meeting different people throughout the world, and they are, you know, academics, and professors, and doctors, and they will always talk conditions. They will say: ""People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive."" They will say: ""People power will work, if the annual income of the country is between X and Z."" They will say: ""People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure."" They will say: ""People power will work only if there is no oil."" And, I mean, there is a set of conditions. Well, the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. Namely, the skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.', '04:12': ""Let me give you an example. I come from a country called Serbia. It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders, with their big egos, behind one single candidate against the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Guess what? That was the day of his defeat. You look at the Egyptians, they fight on Tahrir Square, they get rid of their individual symbols, they appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt. I will give you a counter-example. You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko, you all know the outcome. So unity is a big thing. And this can be achieved. Same with planning. Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution. That thing doesn't exist in the world. Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military, somebody was thinking about it before."", '05:04': ""Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline. And this is probably the game-changer. If you maintain nonviolent discipline, you'll exclusively win. You have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march, one idiot or agent-provocateur throwing a stone. Guess what takes all the cameras. That one guy. One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement."", '05:26': ""Now, let me move to another place. It's the selection of strategies and tactics. There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow. First, you start small. Second, you pick the battles you can win. It's only 200 of us in this room. We won't call for the march of a million. But what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night, all over Krakow. The city will know. So, we pick tactics accommodated to the event, especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion. They're very useful in violent oppression. We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used. It was on Tahrir square, where the international community was constantly frightened that, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution. What they organized -- Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying, a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims, the world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously. So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place, shouting, and you know, showing off in front of the security forces."", '06:35': ""Now, there is also another very important dynamic. And this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see. This is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side, and enthusiasm and humor on another side. So, it works like in a video game. You have the fear high, you have status quo. You have the enthusiasm higher, you see the fear is starting to melt. Day two, you see people running towards the police instead of from the police, in Egypt. You can tell that something is happening there."", '07:04': ""And then, it's about the humor. Humor is such a powerful game-changer, and of course, it was very big in Poland. You know, we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit. We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait of Mr. President on it, in the middle of the Main Street. There was a hole in the top. So you could literally come, put a coin in, get a baseball bat, and hit his face. Sounds loud. And within minutes, we were sitting in a nearby café having coffee, and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing. Well, that's just the beginning of the show. The real show starts when the police appears."", '07:45': '(Laughter)', '07:46': '""What will they do?"" Arrest us? We were nowhere to be seen. We were like three blocks away, observing it from our espresso bar. Arrest the shoppers, with kids? Doesn\'t make sense. Of course, you could bet, they did the most stupid thing. They arrested the barrel. And now, the picture of the smashed face on the barrel, with the policemen dragging it to the police car, that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have.', '08:11': 'So, I mean, these are the things you can do. And you can always use humor. There is also one big thing about humor, it really hurts. Because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously. When you start to mock them, it hurts.', '08:25': 'Now, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet, and it is also a very useful skill. But don\'t rush to label things like ""a Facebook Revolution,"" ""Twitter Revolution."" Don\'t mix the tools with the substance. It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper. They also make it a bit safer for the participants, because they give partial anonymity.', '08:51': 'We\'re watching the great example of something else the Internet can do. It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. This is the famous group ""We are all Khaled Said,"" made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt, and his friend. This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police. This is how he became known to the public, and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel\'s back.', '09:15': 'But here is also the bad news. The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy, or, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click. There are risks to be taken, and there are living people who are winning the struggle.', '09:33': 'Well, the million-dollar question. What will happen in the Arab world? And though young people from the Arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators, shaking the region, kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco to do substantial reforms, it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome. Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition, or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts, whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline, faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already, or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war. Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds? We cannot tell. The same works for the Western sector, where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that. Are they going to become the world wave? Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate? This is the difference between the two paths.', '10:57': ""Now, what do the statistics have? My friend Maria Stephan's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle, and there are some shocking data. If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions, from dictatorship to democracy, you will see that, out of 67 different cases, in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power. This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon, this is one more reason to look at Generation Y. Enough for me to give them credit, and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world."", '11:44': 'Thank you.', '11:45': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I flew on the space shuttle twice, and I lived on the International Space Station for almost six months. People often ask me the same question, which is, ""What\'s it like in space?"" as if it was a secret. Space belongs to all of us, and I\'d like to help you understand why it\'s a place that is magic for all of us.', '00:35': ""The day after my 50th birthday, I climbed aboard a Russian capsule, in Russia, and launched into space. Launching is the most dangerous thing that we do, and it's also the most thrilling. Three, two, one ... liftoff! I felt every single bit of the controlled fury of those rocket engines as they blasted us off the Earth. We went faster and faster and faster, until, after eight and a half minutes, on purpose, those engines stop -- kabunk! -- and we are weightless. And the mission and the magic begin."", '01:20': ""Dmitry and Paolo and I are circling the Earth in our tiny spacecraft, approaching the space station carefully. It's an intricate dance at 17,500 miles an hour between our capsule, the size of a Smart Car, and the space station, the size of a football field. We arrive when those two craft dock with a gentle thunk. We open the hatches, have sloppy zero-G hugs with each other, and now we're six. We're a space family, an instant family."", '02:00': ""My favorite part about living up there was the flying. I loved it. It was like being Peter Pan. It's not about floating. Just the touch of a finger can actually push you across the entire space station, and then you sort of tuck in with your toes. One of my favorite things was drifting silently through the space station, which was humming along at night. I wondered sometimes if it knew I was there, just silent. But sharing the wonder of that with the crew was also part of what was important to me."", '02:39': ""A typical day in space starts with the perfect commute. I wake up, cruise down the lab and say hello to the best morning view ever. It's a really fast commute, only 30 seconds, and we never get tired of looking out that window. I think it reminds us that we're actually still very close to Earth."", '03:05': 'Our crew was the second ever to use the Canadian robotic arm to capture a supply ship the size of a school bus containing about a dozen different experiments and the only chocolate that we would see for the next four months. Now, chocolate aside, every single one of those experiments enables yet one more scientific question answered that we can\'t do down here on Earth. And so, it\'s like a different lens, allowing us to see the answers to questions like, ""What about combustion?"" ""What about fluid dynamics?""', '03:40': 'Now, sleeping is delightful. My favorite -- I mean, you could be upside down, right side up -- my favorite: curled up in a little ball and floating freely.', '03:49': 'Laundry? Nope. We load our dirty clothes into an empty supply ship and send it off into space.', '03:57': ""The bathroom. Everyone wants to know. It's hard to understand, so I made a little video, because I wanted kids to understand that the principle of vacuum saves the day and that just a gentle breeze helps everything go where it is supposed to. Well, in real life it does."", '04:15': '(Laughter)', '04:16': ""Recycling? Of course. So we take our urine, we store it, we filter it and then we drink it. And it's actually delicious."", '04:24': '(Laughter)', '04:26': ""Sitting around the table, eating food that looks bad but actually tastes pretty good. But it's the gathering around the table that's important, I think both in space and on Earth, because that's what cements a crew together."", '04:40': 'For me, music was a way to stay connected to the rest of the world. I played a duet between Earth and space with Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight.', '04:54': ""Connecting to family was so important. I talked with my family almost every day the whole time I was up there, and I would actually read books to my son as a way for us just to be together. So important. Now, when the space station would go over Massachusetts, my family would run outside, and they would watch the brightest star sailing across the sky. And when I looked down, I couldn't see my house, but it meant a lot to me to know that the people I loved the most were looking up while I was looking down."", '05:26': 'So the space station, for me, is the place where mission and magic come together. The mission, the work are vital steps in our quest to go further than our planet and imperative for understanding sustainability here on Earth. I loved being a part of that, and if I could have taken my family with me, I never would have come home.', '05:48': 'And so my view from the station showed me that we are all from the same place.

John Q. Walker demonstrates how recordings can be analyzed for precise keystrokes and pedal motions, then played back on computer-controlled grand pianos.",0:13:22,13.36666667,377150,2008-08-26T01:00:00+00:00,"['entertainment', 'live music', 'music', 'performance', 'piano', 'technology', 'Best of the Web']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",John Q. Walker,Musician and inventor,"{'00:04': ""Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right? And we crave one thing, even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded, the day it was played. And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history, the little rougher it sounds. And so we said, there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things -- but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley, in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things."", '01:48': 'I\'m going to start with Glenn Gould. He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould\'s specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called ""The Goldberg Variations."" Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, ""Here\'s a theme -- 30 variations."" In fact, the theme isn\'t even the melody, it\'s the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, ""No, no, wait a minute. I\'m going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."" What I\'d like you to hear live is the 1955 version, and we\'ll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould, 1955. (Music) How about that? (Applause)', '05:29': ""So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all, let me get you to the end step. This is -- we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. (Music) That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together. (Music)"", '06:43': 'Before ""Jurassic Park,"" there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right? So, in the video world, we\'ve been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately, I started with the experience. And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound. And I got to tell you, if you haven\'t heard high-definition surround, go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer. It\'s so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don\'t have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings -- Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it\'s a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument, and it\'s got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you\'re inside of Glenn Gould\'s body. And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, ""I can\'t believe it! It\'s just what it\'s like to play the piano."" Except now you\'re inside Glenn Gould\'s body playing the piano, and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It\'s a game changer.', '08:03': ""Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt, and steel strings, and all these, and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years. Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool -- they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions, and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know."", '09:04': 'All right, there\'s this episode of ""Star Trek."" (Laughter) I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of ""Star Trek"" for me was James Daly played Methuselah -- remember this one? And at some point he\'s dancing with his -- and I won\'t ruin the episode for you, from 1967. Right, do you know where I\'m going? And Nimoy, I\'m sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round, he goes, ""James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don\'t believe this is one of them in the category."" That\'s where I\'m at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn\'t write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn\'t play. But I believe we\'re on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you\'ve seen happen in the computer graphics world. It\'s now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now, we think music is notes and how they\'re played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you\'ve just heard was a computer playing data -- no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet, it was human. And I believe you\'ll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today, every time you take out your iPod and whatever, every time you listen to it, it\'s the same thing -- it\'s frozen. Wouldn\'t it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different? This morning, you\'re sadder, you want to hear your song, the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.', '10:49': 'We\'ve seen all these ""Star Treks,"" and they\'re all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps. It\'s so amazing, it\'s so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it\'s like, ""Oh my God, I can\'t believe I\'m in the same room. I can\'t believe this is happening."" It\'s a way better experience than whatever you\'re used to listening to, in whatever form. And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I\'ve really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. And I\'ve got to tell you, we have this lab where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company, I didn\'t feel real comfortable about where we were. That\'s a real uncomfortable feeling, when all the equipment\'s come out and a whole Sony team, and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people. And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ... and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately, it\'s right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It\'s one minute long. It\'s an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor. (Music) (Applause) And that\'s just what the live audience did.

The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses, and this is how we end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals."", '01:06': 'And for us to understand what happens with them, we\'re going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people, after the animals are seized, they say, ""Yay, justice has been served. The good guys arrived, took the cute, mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers, and everyone lived happily ever after."" But did they? Actually, no, and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals.', '01:40': ""In Brazil, they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities, in which most of the cases, the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying, they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature, and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. (Laughter)"", '02:27': ""But then what? The Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we're talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore, it would be too risky to release these animals, both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument, they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized. However, this would mean having killed 26,267 birds, only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006."", '03:14': 'But, some researchers, myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health, behavior, inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations, then technically responsible releases are possible, both for the well-being of the individual, and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems, because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -- and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.', '04:05': ""All of these were released by us. On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom. (Laughter) On the middle, this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom, my personal favorite, the little male over there, four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So, this is not new, people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations."", '04:48': 'However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So, I say, ""Let\'s study more, let\'s shed light on this issue, let\'s do whatever we can."" I\'m devoting my career to that. And I\'m here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach: Talk to your neighbor, teach your children, make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.

But getting them to eat cookies or ice cream is relatively easy, and that's because our brains prefer sweetness. Now, there's a new technology called optogenetics which may be able to trick our taste buds, for instance preferring vegetables over sweets. We're going to try this today using fruit flies."", '00:29': '[DIY Neuroscience]', '00:32': ""The reason why we experiment with fruit flies is they have a small enough nervous system that gives us a fighting chance to really understand what's going on. And believe it or not, their taste buds are very similar to ours. But before we try to manipulate their taste preferences, we need to establish: What is the baseline of the fruit fly? What does it prefer? We call this a control experiment. Spencer's been hard at work doing this."", '00:54': ""OK, Spencer, let's do our first experiment. We want to test to see if fruit flies prefer bananas or broccoli. So what do we need?"", '01:00': 'Spencer Brown: So we need the fly pad, which is basically an iPad for flies. It measures the touch.', '01:05': 'GG: You put a fly in each chamber?', '01:07': ""SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll offer them banana and broccoli to see which one they prefer."", '01:12': 'GG: In order to count how many times the fruit fly eats a banana versus the broccoli, these chambers have been outfitted with a small electrode that sends data to a computer. And so what were your findings on banana versus broccoli?', '01:23': 'SB: I found that the flies visited banana the most.', '01:26': 'GG: Both were there, but like most kids, they choose not to eat the broccoli, and they go switch to something sweeter.', '01:32': ""GG: Now a quick background on how taste works. Taste buds are made up of specialized neurons called taste receptors. When we eat something that triggers a particular taste, those taste neurons will fire a signal to the brain. This allows our brain to know what's sweet and what's bitter. So when a fruit fly eats a banana, its sweet taste neurons will fire. But when it eats broccoli, those same neurons stay pretty quiet. But what if we could force those sweet-tasting neurons to fire every time the fruit fly eats broccoli? We may be able to get the fruit fly to like broccoli as much as banana."", '02:01': 'Enter optogenetics. This is the revolutionary new tool that\'s taking neuroscience by storm, and in this case, ""opto"" means light and ""genetic"" refers to the fact that these fruit flies have been modified to contain a special gene that makes only certain neurons respond to light. In our case, we\'ve added the special gene to the sweet taste receptors.', '02:20': ""Now here's the fun part. Optogenetics means that we can control these special neurons whenever they're exposed to a bright-colored light, causing them to send messages to the brain. In this experiment, we're going to have these modified fruit flies choose between banana and broccoli again, only this time, every time the fruit fly eats the broccoli, we're going to trigger a big bright red light. And when the channels see that red light, they're going to open up, and they're going to cause that neuron to fire, and the sweet taste message will be sent to the brain."", '02:47': 'How do you get them out?', '02:48': ""SB: So we're going to be using a mouth aspirator, so it's just two straws put together."", '02:53': ""GG: So it's a fancy name for a straw."", '02:54': 'SB: Basically.', '02:56': ""GG: So you're going to suck those out. Have you ever sucked up a fly before?"", '03:01': 'SB: Once or twice.', '03:07': ""GG: There we go. You got all four. OK, perfect. So you're going to turn on your OptoStimmers here. You're going to park the light right on top of the chambers. So now we sit here and we wait for them to eat broccoli, and then when the light fires, they're going to think it's tasting something sweet."", '03:23': ""Come on. Oh, he's getting closer. Come on. It tastes good now."", '03:27': ""SB: It's about to."", '03:29': ""GG: Oh, he's back. All right! All right, so now we see that some of these flies are switching over from the banana to the broccoli."", '03:36': 'SB: Exactly, yeah.', '03:38': ""GG: Every time this light goes off, that means that they think they're tasting something sweet."", '03:42': ""SB: Yeah. So this guy's really going after it."", '03:44': ""GG: So we saw that we were able to rescue broccoli and make it just as appealing as banana to our fruit flies. And we're able to replicate these same results in all of our experiments. So the question is: Can we do the same thing in humans? Well, that depends on a number of items. First, do optogenetic tools even work in humans? And that looks like the answer is yes, and in fact, clinical trials are already being planned that will treat chronic pain and blindness using optogenetics. And the next question is, can we easily trigger a light source so that every time we eat vegetables, it will go off? For that, I'm afraid at least at this time, the answer is still no. But today, we got to witness just a taste of optogenetics and its amazing potential."", '04:23': '(Music)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, I'm just going to grab a chair here."", '00:27': 'Two years ago at TED, I think -- I\'ve come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. I think that I may have believed unconsciously, then, that I was kind of a business hero. I had this company that I\'d spent 15 years building. It\'s called Future; it was a magazine publishing company. It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars, a number I didn\'t really understand. A magazine I\'d recently launched called Business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory, busy pumping hot air into the bubble. (Laughter) And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more. And all this had come from nothing. Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said, ""I really would like to start my own computer magazine."" And 15 years later, there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times. The date was February 2000. I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore\'s Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever. I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.', '02:11': 'The dotcom, ironically called Snowball, was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell. I watched everything that I\'d built crumbling, and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing. And it was gut wrenching. It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees, something which I was very proud of in the business. February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people, and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies. I felt sick. I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months. And worse than that, far worse than that, my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating. I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: ""LOSER."" (Laughter) And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back, is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing?', '03:42': ""Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball, but I was, at that point, ready to move on. And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to. And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations, that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster -- emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years. This has been a big, big transition time, and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next. The theme next year is re-birth."", '04:25': ""It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED. And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that, I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus: I started to read again. And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games, there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest: cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected. It's connected; it all hooks into each other."", '05:26': 'We talk about this a lot, and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example: Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president, was famously asked once, ""What do you most desire?"" And she answered, ""A penis."" And when you think about it, it\'s very true: what we all most desire is a penis -- or ""happiness"" as we say in English. (Laughter) And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room. (Laughter) (Applause)', '06:19': ""But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. You can ask about what causes it biochemically: neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff. You can ask what are the psychological causes of it: nature? Nurture? Current circumstance? Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing. You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem: do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly? You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness, and whereas almost all the rest of them, regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever -- are almost equally happy on average? Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing: did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized, to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate? Are we the victims of a mass delusion? And so on, and so on."", '07:48': 'To understand even something as important to us as happiness, you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions, and there\'s nowhere that I\'ve discovered -- other than TED -- where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions. And so, it\'s the profound thing that Richard talks about: to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits; a little bit about everything that surrounds it. And so, gradually over these three days, you start off kind of trying to figure out, ""Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"" And at the end of the four days, your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited, and it\'s because all these different bits have been put together. It\'s the total brain experience, we\'re going to ... it\'s the mental equivalent of the full body massage. (Laughter) Every mental organ addressed. It really is.', '08:42': ""Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right? So, I will. Here's the vision for TED."", '08:49': 'Number one: do nothing. This thing ain\'t broke, so I ain\'t gonna fix it. Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me, ""Chris, TED is a really great conference. You\'re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."" (Laughter) So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit, no bandwagoning, no platforms. Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies, across all the disciplines that are represented here. That\'s not going to be changed at all.', '09:53': ""Number two: I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year. The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines. There's a year to do this, and already -- I hope to show you a bit later -- there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year. And I'm getting fantastic help from the community; this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet. It's true."", '10:28': ""Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit. And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club. Books kind of saved me in the last couple years, and that's a gift that I would like to pass on. So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. They may well be by a TED speaker, and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey. I think it will be great."", '11:14': ""And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation, which is the new owner of TED. What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for. And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy. Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world, and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference. I'm incredibly excited about that. In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life. I'm in this for the long run, and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was afraid of a tsunami; what I didn\'t realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti, and that was building collapse. We\'ve all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake, while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace -- the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses\' college -- there are 300 nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.', '01:19': ""We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti, but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000, that displaced 1.3 million people, that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades, and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering."", '02:14': ""AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed, to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH, which is the U.N. mission in Haiti, with the Ministry of Public Works, with different NGOs, we inspected over 1,500 buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings."", '02:54': ""This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault -- who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo -- was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me, after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way, that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same: walls and slabs not tied properly into columns -- that's a roof slab hanging off the building -- cantilevered structures, or structures that were asymmetric, that shook violently and came down, poor building materials, not enough concrete, not enough compression in the blocks, rebar that was smooth, rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away."", '04:01': ""Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile, almost a month later, when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince -- 500 times the power, yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density, that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti? Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile, it's ripped in half, but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades."", '05:21': 'Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel; he\'s a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss, and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside, and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him, ""You know, we don\'t have to do this wrong. It won\'t cost us any more to do it the right way."" And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right, they poured the columns right, and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe.', '06:17': ""To make sure these buildings are safe, it's not going to take policy -- it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there, Craig Toten, he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired, through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity, AIDG, there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction, you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime."", '07:26': ""Ultimately, there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti; the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building, where the walls are tied together, the building is symmetric, and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster, there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation, so that when the next earthquake hits, it is a disaster -- but not a tragedy."", '08:08': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Laughs) And on the other hand, you need a very complex positioning system. We call it ""Agathe,"" because it\'s very heavy, and we thought Agathe was a nice name.', '01:18': '(Laughter)', '01:21': ""And, well, you need this system to move the laser through, for example, at the very accurate level, about 200 nanometers, so very accurate. And, well, what can you do with that? You can do things that you cannot see with your eyes. So you can print out whatever you want, you can print out a tower bridge, you can print out Agathe's husband ..."", '01:42': '(Laughter)', '01:45': 'OK, but, what makes it so mind-blowing?', '01:51': ""You maybe notice this scale bar, and it's 100 microns for the tower bridge and 20 microns for the fat man. For comparison, the diameter of a human hair is around 50 microns. So these objects are like a dust particle or even smaller, so you can hardly see them. What you can also do and what we are also working on is improving the system, improving the resins, the material we use for catching a worm or something else. Inside the resin, we move the laser through the resin, it gets polymerized, and we catch a living animal, here, a special worm. What we're trying to do, or what the next step would be, is to make biocompatible polymers and maybe to write some things inside your body or inside the body of a worm, or to attach cells to our structures, and so on."", '02:56': ""But, OK, that's my normal working field. Today I want to tell the story behind the microprinter. What was my motivation? Well, everything started on Monday morning, 6:30. OK, that's a lie. Maybe it was 10 o'clock."", '03:13': '(Laughter)', '03:14': 'I went to my laser lab, which is located near Karlsplatz, in Freihaus, at the Vienna University of Technology. I went in, and I saw that this laser system was broken, and I tried to fix it. It took me half a day, several hours. Then I noticed, OK, there is a major issue with the pump source. I cannot fix that myself; we have to call the service technician. And from that point on, I noticed I had time to think. So I thought, ""What to do now? Maybe start to write my PhD thesis.""', '03:46': '(Laughter)', '03:48': 'No, no, not a good idea at all. So I started thinking, maybe write a scientific paper. Not a good idea at all. And then, on Saturday, after a week of thinking, I came up with the idea to build the smallest 3-D microprinter in the world.', '04:06': '(Laughter)', '04:07': 'Or, the smallest 3-D printer in the world.', '04:09': '(Applause)', '04:14': 'So I called my professor and told him about it.', '04:18': '""Hey, let\'s build the thing! I have time. Is it OK?""', '04:21': '""Go ahead, build it.""', '04:22': ""And so I went to the university, and from that point on, I just put everything out of my brain inside the computer to make this CAD construction of the whole thing. And after a few months, we had the first test run with the system. It worked brilliantly from the first test on, and it had the same resolution as systems which cost 60,000 euros, and we only spent 1,500 euros for the system, not including my salary, but that wouldn't add so much on its own."", '04:58': '(Laughter)', '05:00': 'OK, how does this work?', '05:02': ""I brought you a video where you can see how you can put in your three-dimensional file. This video was produced by a friend of mine, Junior Veloso. And you can see, you have a set stage which moves up. And under the set stage, there is a liquid, which gets solidified by the light. And slice by slice, you create the model, so you really pull it out of the liquid. And it just depends on how big your model is. Maybe you have 100 slices, 1,000 or 10,000 slices. So that's how it works. Of course, this is a much bigger machine than the microprinter, but it uses more or less the same principles, so that's what I want to show you. At the end, this head, this alien head, is attached to the building platform, and when the process is done, you just simply have to break the head from the support structure you need, and then everything is ready. So."", '06:13': ""OK, but what does the microprinter look like? Well, maybe some of you have already seen this picture. I also brought it to you in person, so I want to kindly introduce you to the 3-D microprinter, which looks like this. So it's very small, it's really a desktop version. It's a really affordable system. And we are really proud of it, actually, and --"", '06:38': '(Laughter)', '06:41': 'And you have this tiny little system; there are bigger ones. What can you do with a cheap, affordable system? For example, you all know these hearing aids? They have to be produced individually for each person, so this is a perfect example for using this technology to create the shell for a hearing aid. Normally, you go to the store, they scan your ear, they send the data to Germany via email, and --', '07:13': '(Laughter)', '07:15': 'and then they print it out with a --', '07:17': '(Applause)', '07:18': 'Thank you.', '07:19': '(Applause)', '07:25': ""Then they print it out with a big machine, and then, when it's ready to send back to Vienna or wherever you are -- via post -- then they put in the electronics."", '07:37': 'When you have a microprinter in your store, you can go to the store, they scan your ear, they just press ""Print,"" the 3-D model gets sliced, and you can go for a coffee, you can go to the university, whatever you want, and instead of five days, you can have your ear shell or your hearing aid in just one day. And that is an example of how these tiny little machines or other cheap 3-D printers could change our everyday lives.', '08:13': 'So thank you very much, and start printing whatever you want, whatever you need.', '08:18': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections from Mozart’s beloved opera, ""The Magic Flute."" The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above the instruments. Its melody rings out across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice can be heard so clearly, above the strains of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique of an expert opera singer.', '00:54': 'All the music in this opera house originates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number of waves per second–– is how our brains determine the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them is how opera singers work their magic.', '01:52': 'Every note has a set of frequencies that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times the fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments produce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly attuned to some frequencies than others.', '02:42': 'This is the key to an opera singer’s power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard voice parts— can produce notes with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations per second. Human ears are most sensitive to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre called a singer’s squillo.', '03:30': 'Opera singers work for decades to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones while dampening others. Singers also increase their range of partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound that rings out over the instruments’ comparatively narrow vibratos.', '04:02': 'Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect sound waves towards the audience.', '04:20': 'All singers take advantage of these techniques, but different vocal signatures demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs to build up stamina to power through the composer’s four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age.', '04:48': 'But whether in an opera hall or a shower stall, these techniques can turn un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications. First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone. Consider the planet Venus in our solar system. If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life. It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun. An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin. But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface. Not by life as we know it. It's too hot. That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and is almost 100 times thicker than our own. As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is dry as a bone. So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth. In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments. We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet, in boiling waters of the ocean floor, in acidic waters of thermal springs, and in cloud droplets miles above our heads. These so-called extremophiles aren't rare. Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface. These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine. These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg. It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars. Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa, where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust. Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space. Could these geysers be raining microbes? Could we fly through them to find out? And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water? Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment. Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks. Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds. The only way to find out is to go out and explore.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We\'re in 17th century Japan on the west coast, and a little, wizened monk is hurrying along, near midnight, to the crest of a small hill. He arrives on the small hill, dripping with water. He stands there, and he looks across at the island, Sado. And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky. Then he says to himself, very quietly, ""[Turbulent the sea,] [Stretching across to Sado] [The Milky Way]."" Basho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. Basho, in 17 syllables, juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past, and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars, probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets, maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time. As he was nearing his death, his disciples and followers kept asking him, ""What\'s the secret? How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"" And toward the end, he said, ""If you would know the pine tree, go to the pine tree."" That was it.', '02:16': '(Laughter)', '02:19': ""Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans, we must go to the oceans. And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit, is really transforming the relationship, or the interplay, between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. Another is that there are bold, new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold, new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans, and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet, for what it's worth. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet, the entire planet, continents and oceans together. That's the system."", '03:39': ""And basically, our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes, two sources of energy, one of which is solar, that drives the winds, the waves, the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis. The second one is internal energy. And these two war against one another almost continuously. Mountain ranges, plate tectonics, moves the continents around, forms ore deposits. Volcanoes erupt. That's the planet that we live on. It's immensely complex."", '04:15': ""Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here, but what I want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously, and have for the last 4 billion years. This is a system that's been around a very long time. And these have all co-evolved. What do I mean by that? They interact with one another constantly. All of them interact with one another. So the complexity of this system that we're looking at, the one driven by the sun -- upper portion, mostly -- and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes. This is very, very important because this is the system, this is the crucible, out of which life on the planet came, and it's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it. That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about: understand this ocean of ours, this basic life support system, the dominant life support system on the planet."", '05:20': ""Look at this complexity here. This is only one variable. If you can see the complexity, you can see how tiny, little eddies and large eddies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature, but it's immensely complicated. Now a layer in, the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting, partly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors, and you've got a really complicated system. That's our challenge, is to understand, understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. And there's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. And part of the issue is for Cody -- who's here, 16 years old -- and I have permission to relay this number. When he, 40 years from now, is the age of Nancy Brown, there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet. We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans, but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now, then the stresses that we will face, and that Cody will face, and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98, will have really problems coping."", '06:52': ""All right, let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. Look at this diagram, which is showing warm waters in red, cool waters in blue, and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green, is the growth of vegetation, and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation. And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from 1982 to 1998 and then cycling again. What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth, of vegetation -- a subset of which is food on the continents -- is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. The oceans control, or at least significantly influence, correlate with, the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents. So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas, need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans. I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates, gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference."", '08:06': ""And I share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time. Seconds after this video was taken, people in Beijing, people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam, people in Washington D.C. were watching this. Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents, but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor, there is vast reservoir of microbial activity, which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet. It's an astonishing insight, and we have only found out about this recently. This is very, very exciting. It may be the next rainforest, in terms of pharmaceuticals. We know little or nothing about it."", '09:08': 'Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that, ""The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory, but possibly in having new sets of eyes,"" new ways of seeing things, a new mindset. And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography, when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. And it wasn\'t easy. It wasn\'t easy in those days. Some of you remember this, I\'m sure. And now, we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful -- ships, satellites, moorings. But they don\'t quite cut it. They don\'t quite give us what we need.', '09:50': ""And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here, was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. Modeling: on the right hand side, there's a very complex computational model. On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring, which I'll show you in just a second. And on the basis of several points, the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth. They are changing rapidly, but not predictably. And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. The computational power is amazing. But without data, those models will never ever be predicted. And that's what we really need. For a variety of reasons they're dangerous, but we feel that OOI, this Ocean Observatory Initiative, which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund, has the potential to really transform things. And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins, utilizing widely accessible, interactive telepresence. It's a new world."", '11:02': ""We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean, at will, communicating in real time. And this is what the system involves, a number of sites in the southern hemisphere, shown in those circles. And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. I won't talk a lot about most of them right here, but the one on the west coast, that's in the box, is called the regional scale nodes. It was once called Neptune. And let me show you what's behind it."", '11:31': ""Fiber: next-generation way of communicating. You can see the copper tips on these things. You can transmit power, but the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter. And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. This is phenomenal bandwidth. And this is what the planet looks like. We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like. This is what it looks like. And the cables go really continent to continent. It's a very powerful system, and most of our communications consist of it."", '12:11': ""So this is the system that I'm talking about, off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate, the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume -- in the overlying ocean, on the sea floor and below the sea floor. Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. This is what one of those primary nodes looks like, and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle. And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table. They will bring it and link it in. It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope, except you'll have your own port. Climate change, ocean acidification, dissolved oxygen, carbon cycle, coastal upwelling, fishing dynamics -- the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. And this is just the first of these. In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up."", '13:28': ""Now I want to take you into the caldera. On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. Very powerful. That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down, but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it. Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while, because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet. There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore, all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location, then move to a new location."", '14:17': ""We're flying across the caldera floor. There is a number of robotic systems. There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will, if those are your experiments. The kinds of systems that will be down there, the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor, consist of -- if you can read them there -- there's cameras, there's pressure sensors, fluorometers, there's seismometers. It's a full spectrum of tools. Now, that mound right there actually looks like this. This is what it actually looks like. And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high-definition video, because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo HD systems running continuously and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land. Very, very powerful. And these are the things that we're funded to do today."", '15:13': ""So what can we actually do tomorrow? We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography, which we will incorporate into oceanography, and through that convergence, we will transform oceanography into something even more magical. Robotics systems are just incredible these days, absolutely incredible. And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. Nanotechnology: this is a small generator. It's smaller than a postage stamp, and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. Just as you move, it generates power. There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously. Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I, but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years."", '16:09': ""And this is the magic one. As a result of the human genome process, we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean -- like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort -- can actually be sampled. We pump the fluid through one of these systems, and we press the button, and it's analyzed for the genomic character. And that's transmitted back to land immediately. So in the volume of the ocean, we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry, but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. Grid computing: the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. The power generation will come from the ocean itself. And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. It's far beyond what we currently have. So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented."", '17:16': ""So within five to seven years, I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet, so we can reach many, many folks. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. Here's an example. When earthquakes take place, massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. We have a way of addressing that, a new way of addressing that. We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting, so we deploy the troops. What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course. And they fly into the erupting volcano. They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption, which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before. They eject it to the surface where it floats, and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane, and it's brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption. This is doable. All the pieces are there."", '18:28': ""A laboratory: many of you heard what happened on 9/7. Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning, and it would be on live TV, if we have interesting things to show. So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world, throughout the ocean. This -- I've shown you sea floor -- but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth. It's going to be amazing."", '19:03': ""And as I go here, I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms, and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket. Many of you don't think of this yet, but the ocean will be in your pocket. It won't be long. It won't be long."", '19:22': 'So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet, if you\'ll forgive me. In 1943, T.S. Eliot wrote the ""Four Quartets."" He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948. In ""Little Gidding"" he says -- speaking I think for the human race, but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia -- ""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time, arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for, but heard, half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea.""', '20:27': 'Thank you.', '20:29': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/barbara_block_tagging_tuna_in_the_deep_ocean,Tagging tuna in the deep ocean,"Tuna are ocean athletes -- fast, far-ranging predators whose habits we're just beginning to understand. Marine biologist Barbara Block fits tuna with tracking tags (complete with transponders) that record unprecedented amounts of data about these gorgeous, threatened fish and the ocean habitats they move through.",0:19:51,19.85,370392,2010-10-06T08:53:00+00:00,"['mission blue', 'oceans', 'science', 'technology']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Barbara Block,Marine biologist,"{'00:09': ""I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty, form and function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warmblooded like us. They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish. They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift, powers its movements with a lunate tail. It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body, so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines."", '00:59': ""Now, bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal, and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back 3,000 years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth, and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet, the type of fishing going on today, with pens, with enormous stakes, is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin, in general, goes to one place: Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem; we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small. The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton. The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year."", '02:31': ""The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population, there's been tremendous decline on both sides, as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950. For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago, despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about, perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks, sharks, marlin, albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna, and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room."", '03:50': ""It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors, and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna, a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU, getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays, an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome."", '05:14': ""So the story of our team, a dedicated team, is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts, or the same parts that are in your computer, chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time, we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean, put it behind glass, and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning, we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean, one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function, their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space, ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty."", '06:25': ""Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here, for over 14 or 15 years, we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat? What is it that they're happy with? We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption, its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder: how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did? So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now, the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean."", '07:48': ""So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas. It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out, we measure it. A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills, give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes, we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected, when that tag comes back, because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward, we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now, on a backboned animal."", '09:02': ""Now sometimes the tunas are really large, such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort, a team effort, to bring the fish in. In this case, what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna, senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish, detach, float to the surface and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag, pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City, every winter for over a decade, held a party called Tag-A-Giant, and together, fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish. In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles, we can get information on gender, checking the pop-up tag one more time, and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite."", '10:43': ""With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically, we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex -- and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this, we're able now to put the map up, and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas -- that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that -- and a second population. Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations."", '12:01': ""And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission, building new models, showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day, used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model isn't the right model. This model, a model of overlap, is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species, the single population, can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job. But in the international realm, where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild, these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna."", '12:54': 'Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we\'re one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas. So what we\'ve done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say ""very carefully,"" -- we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna. It\'s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren\'t the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey.', '14:17': 'Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target -- it\'s a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat. It\'s a several thousand-pound animal. And we\'ll wind in the target. And we\'ll place an acoustic tag that says, ""OMSHARK 10165,"" or something like that, acoustically with a ping. And then we\'ll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that\'s on the fish. So in this case, Sal\'s looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues, blue sharks. And now, together, what we can see on this ocean of color that\'s temperature, we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go.', '15:27': 'The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned, and when they get returned, here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor, returning to the Western Pacific.', '16:01': ""Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags, light-based tags, that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back, journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small, we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes, up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean."", '17:09': ""And from this information, we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles."", '18:10': ""This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together."", '18:57': ""So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere? And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps, if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths."", '19:38': 'So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans.', '19:50': 'Thank you.', '19:52': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the novel, she interrogates the culture of her native India, including its social mores and colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary social class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated with specific occupations had been divided into some 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was Constitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape social life in India, routinely marginalizing people of lower castes.', '01:43': 'In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a close relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called “untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu, embark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the “love laws” forbidding intimacy between different castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.”', '02:15': 'Roy’s writing makes constant use of these ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most tragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the twins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and crisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like raindrops from a roof.', '02:40': 'The novel forays into the past to explore the characters’ struggles to operate in a world where they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s political turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her beloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her parents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her for being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair with Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment to their family, but also with his membership to a budding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.”', '03:15': 'In the 1960s, the misleadingly named “Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes off their land and caused widespread environmental damage.', '03:35': 'When the twins return to Ayemenem as adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution are all around them. The river that was bursting with life in their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile, with holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised from a hospital bed.”', '03:53': 'As Roy probes the depths of human experience, she never loses sight of the way her characters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of ""The God of Small Things,"" “Various kinds of despair competed for primacy… personal despair could never be desperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible public turmoil of a nation.”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I work as an artist and designer. And I like to try to find the hidden talents of everyday things. So before I get started, I want to show you a fast smattering of some examples of what I do. But this talk today is really less about what I make and is more about why I make these things."", '00:26': 'So, I get to tinker with everyday experiences. As we go through our everyday lives, visual and experiential things exert this invisible authority over our brains at all times. And they yield this power in subtle and sneaky ways. So visuals, for example, speak volumes through these teeny, tiny details, codified in things like type, shape, color and texture. So these small, picky things form the vocabulary that come together and make the sentences, enabling us to make tangible things like ... a solar-powered Popsicle truck.', '01:11': '(Laughter)', '01:12': ""It educates the public about renewable energy. It's basically a physical infographic on wheels. And this unexpected pairing of sugar, bright colors and the threat of humanity's self-inflicted demise actually makes for a pretty convincing argument for solar."", '01:31': ""People arrive at experiences like these with expectations. And when we make things, we're actively choosing what to do with those expectations. In my work, I want to create disruptive wonder. I want to confound these expectations, because I think that every day, fundamental things and experiences frame reality in a way that we often take for granted. The small things we make can work to reinforce our assumptions about the world. Or small things can come out of left field and draw us into reassessing our complacent expectations about reality. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's awesome. Because then, these small things act as sort of a humble back door into understanding a reality that's infinitely surprising."", '02:23': 'So, as a little demonstration, back to the most basic and fundamental part of myself again: my name, kellianderson.com, spelled out in block letters. This is how people find me in the world. It means me. But in a more objective sense, it\'s really just this random jumble of letters that I\'ve confined to the single possibility of making my name. So naturally, I wondered: What else can these letters spell? Turns out, all kinds of interesting phrases, like ... ""Ken doll is near dot com.""', '02:56': '(Laughter)', '02:59': 'A little bit creepy. And ""A colder melon skin."" Period.', '03:07': '(Laughter)', '03:08': ""Far better use of those kellianderson.com letters, I'm sure you'll agree."", '03:14': ""This is a dumb game, but it underscores a belief I have, that the world is full of order that doesn't necessarily deserve our respect. Sometimes, there's meaning, justice and logic present in the way things are. But sometimes there just isn't. I think that the moment we realize this is the moment we become creative people, because it prompts us to mess things up and do something better with the basic pieces of experience. What I'm after in my work, really, is this: the hidden talents of everyday things -- all of those overlooked powers bestowed on the things that surround us by the wonders of physics, the complexities of cultural associations and a gazillion other only partially chartable things. So today, I want to show you three projects that reconsider the vast properties of commonplace experience and try to do something better by doing something more absurd."", '04:13': ""This first project is a holiday card I made for my friends. My goal in this was to get people to notice this going-through-the-motions holiday thing that I'm sure we've all felt before. And I did that through a holiday card, of course. From the outside, it looks pretty normal. But paper has this memory; paper never forgets how it was bent. I was able to use that material memory to guide the recipient through the experience of the card. So when you first pick it up, while floppy, it's clear it wants to bend in all of these certain ways. As people tinker with it, they discover that bending the card brings them through this simple story. And as you can see, it's a story about itself."", '04:56': '(Laughter)', '04:59': 'This card is literally a four-frame documentary about receiving the card.', '05:05': '(Laughter)', '05:09': ""So it's a recursive experience."", '05:11': '(Applause)', '05:12': ""Oh, well, thank you. This excites me, because it's a recursive experience of a holiday card that gets the viewer to feel this repetitive ritual of all holiday cards. And it begins life as a humble piece of paper that came out of my inkjet printer. I think that's pretty cool."", '05:33': 'In a sense, that project was all about ritual becoming empty gesture. And it speaks to the fact that the more an experience repeats itself, the less it means --', '05:44': '(Laughter)', '05:45': ""because we begin to take it for granted. And that's why cliches aren't interesting, and why people get in car wrecks near their homes. When we experience things over and over again, they just lose their gravity. So while paper does have all of these astonishing, overlooked capabilities, it takes a hell of a lot of intervention into getting us to see it as new again."", '06:07': 'This next project I want to show you is a wedding invitation, which is a format practically begging for reinvention.', '06:14': '(Laughter)', '06:16': ""This is a card I made for my friends Mike and Karen, who happen to be really awesome people. Far more awesome, in fact, than the format of wedding invitations. So it was a really good excuse to push the boundaries of this format. And as far as how to push it, the facts of our shared history made it clear that this card should be about music. We're all total music nerds, and Karen and Mike have even recorded songs together. But you know, you also find inspiration in the darnedest of places. And we found some with this guy, Mr. Wizard --"", '06:49': '(Laughter)', '06:50': ""who had a much-beloved TV show, teaching kids about the science behind everyday things. And I remembered this episode that demonstrated sound is physical, with this simple experiment. He rolled up a cone of paper, he taped it shut, he taped a needle to the end of it, and -- voilà! -- it was a record player. I remember seeing this as a kid, and it totally blew my mind. If you can make a record player out of a piece of paper and a sewing needle, what isn't possible out of the world?"", '07:20': ""So I explained this idea to Mike and Karen, and we all decided that it would be way better to make their guests paper record players, rather than traditional, boring invitations. We started getting really, really excited. And I started getting really nervous, because I'm the one who had to actually make it work. So I began spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about needles: Like, would we find needles with the right fidelity? I started calling paper suppliers, looking for the paper with the best audio properties."", '07:47': '(Laughter)', '07:48': 'And they thought I was crazy.', '07:53': 'Meanwhile, Mike and Karen were recording a song, which they had mastered to a clear flexi disc. I had this black-and-white character printed on it, so that way, when the disc is turned, it completes the couple in all of these different guises.', '08:05': '(Laughter)', '08:08': 'So we did it, we really did it! We made a paper record player -- 200 recipient-operated paper record players. This is an actual recording of how it sounds. And then it segues into the real song for comparison.', '08:24': '(Music and singing)', '08:48': '(Music ends)', '08:51': 'We were so excited when we finally got that to work.', '08:53': '(Laughter)', '08:55': 'And I was excited that we uncovered this hidden talent of paper in the process.', '09:01': 'I also love that project because it brings attention to the fact that we approach media with all these expectations that we do not necessarily need. We have assumptions about material experience, like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat. But we also have these assumptions --', '09:20': '(Laughter)', '09:21': ""that should be a lot scarier in a democracy, because they're like these little thought loopholes. We sleepwalk through our assumptions about the authority in media and assumptions put forth about political realities by media, like newspapers. But I, for one, have faith in these small, hacked experiences to inspire a sense of skepticism at this limited reality we've been handed. And this next project demonstrates just that."", '09:50': 'Imagine your normal, everyday commuter-newspaper-reading ritual. But what if you are handed a paper filled with stories from an alternate reality?', '09:59': '(Laughter)', '10:01': 'Specifically: What if some crazy person had meticulously recreated a typical paper depicting an alternate reality? This is something we actually did do in the fall of 2008, in a project that was conceptualized by artist Steve Lambert, organized by The Yes Men and executed by many, many people, some of whom are me. We made a perfectly counterfeited ""New York Times."" We didn\'t ask anyone for permission, we just did it.', '10:29': '(Laughter)', '10:30': 'We had it mass-produced, and we put it in the hands of hundreds of thousands of commuters on a Thursday morning in New York City.', '10:37': '(Laughter)', '10:38': '(Applause and cheers)', '10:40': 'Thanks!', '10:42': '(Applause)', '10:46': '""Why?,"" you might ask. ""Why make a fake newspaper?"" Well, quite frankly, because the real newspaper is depressing. We ostensibly live in a democracy where we should have some say in what happens in the world. But the truth is, we never see the stories we want to see in the newspaper. So we made a paper with only good news.', '11:07': '(Laughter)', '11:08': 'We put in all the policy ideas we thought would actually help the world. Years before the withdrawal was even discussed, we ended the war in Iraq. Years before Occupy Wall Street, we put in a maximum wage law --', '11:21': '(Laughter)', '11:24': 'to end the ginormous wage inequities between the lowest and highest income earners. We returned civics class to high school curriculum.', '11:32': '(Laughter)', '11:34': ""See? These are good ideas! So then students would know how their government works again. There's a very important difference between these two papers."", '11:44': '(Laughter)', '11:46': 'While the real ""New York Times"" has this slogan of, ""All the News that\'s Fit to Print,"" we offered a more forward-thinking message of, ""All the News We Hope to Print.""', '11:56': '(Laughter)', '11:57': ""And that's because our paper is postdated six months into the future, so when people are handed these on the street, they were literally getting an artifact from the utopian future, sort of a blueprint for an attainably utopian future brought about by this very important idea of popular pressure."", '12:14': ""And our hoax worked perfectly. We suspended people in this strange mental space, because while the stories in the paper couldn't be real, it just felt so perfectly, impeccably real. Here's a video showing --"", '12:26': '(Laughter)', '12:28': 'yes, we did that! -- showing the first few seconds of conflicted belief, where people could feel for a moment what --', '12:35': '(Laughter)', '12:44': 'Yes!', '12:46': '(Laughter)', '12:54': ""This guy's good."", '12:57': '(Laughter)', '13:01': 'But in order to get this type of reaction, our paper had to be radically believable. And Daniel Dunnam, my other half, and I formed the believability team. He made sure that the typography, the layout, the smell of the ink -- everything -- was just like a real ""New York Times."" And I supplied fake advertisements from the utopian future.', '13:25': '(Laughter)', '13:26': 'We decided that the utopian future would be a perfect venue to help these companies who had done wrong in the past try making amends for that wrongdoing.', '13:34': '(Laughter)', '13:35': 'And we do this through the vocabulary of their own advertising. So for Ikea, what if instead of cheap furniture, you could buy your own wind farm? It comes flat-packed, clearly easy to assemble --', '13:49': '(Laughter)', '13:52': 'with that little zigzag tool and the wooden pegs. That would be awesome, right? More nefarious are companies like De Beers, who are making amends for their sale of blood diamonds by donating prosthetics to war-torn African countries. And this is our take on a used car dealership ad. They\'re now offering a ""cash for polluters"" program. So now you can trade in your car for a non-polluting type of transportation: a bicycle!', '14:19': '(Laughter)', '14:20': ""And here's my favorite, Dr. Zizmor, who is giving you a beautiful, clear conscience. If you haven't taken a ride on the New York City subway, you may not know Dr. Z. But if you have, then you do, because his cheesy rainbow ads are everywhere. But now he is foregoing these superficial services. He's no longer cleaning up your face, now he's cleaning up our mess in Iraq."", '14:43': '(Laughter)', '14:46': 'So the news of our fake paper made it onto the real news all around the world. These unexpected messages of hope were able to get out there through our sheer brazenness in ripping off the ""New York Times,"" but also because we leveraged this pathway that no one had expected. We pushed our paper beyond its expected role in reporting the news, and we made a blueprint for a better world.', '15:12': ""With those three projects, I demonstrate that by rejecting normal order, by messing things up and by rearranging the pieces, we can expand our notion of what we demand from reality. So today, I want to put forth this idea that an avenue to better is through a million teeny, tiny disruptions to whatever is sitting in front of you. So go mess with the complacently rational.

But don’t be fooled by their beachside behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are incredible endurance hunters. Hurtling around at speeds from 4 to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time, these majestic mammals live up to their name. And thanks to a suite of physical adaptations, finely tuned over millions of years, they make for resourceful foragers.', '00:48': 'To find their favorite food, sea lions hunt much deeper than many of their semi-aquatic peers. With some species diving to depths of nearly 400 meters, they’re able to cope with the mounting pressure by collapsing their pliable rib cage, and compressing a pair of springy lungs. This pushes air up through the smaller airways, collapsing rings of cartilage as oxygen travels out from the lungs, to be held in the larger, upper airways. Upon surfacing, this air will be used to re-inflate the lungs, but for now their heart slows down to preserve oxygen. Blood flow is redirected towards only the most essential organs like the heart, lungs, and brain, which rely on reserve oxygen stored in blood and muscle.', '01:34': 'Once they arrive at their hunting ground, sea lions depend on their superior vision to find their prey. Most mammal eyes have a structure called a lens– a transparent, convex structure whose shape refracts light to enable sight. In humans, this lens is curved to process light waves traveling through air. But sea lions need to see their best at hundreds of meters deep. To accommodate, their eyes have a much rounder lens to refract light underwater, as well as teardrop-shaped pupils which can expand to 25 times their original size. This lets in as much light as possible, helping them pinpoint their prey in even the dimmest conditions.', '02:15': 'But once they’ve closed in, they rely on something akin to a sixth sense to actually catch their meal. Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are composed of keratin and full of nerve fibers that run deep into the connective tissue of their face. Sea lions have full directional control over these whiskers, which can lie flat against their face, or stick out at a 90-degree angle. When properly tuned, these whiskers can sense the slim trails of moving water fish leave in their wake. And they’re precise enough to let blindfolded sea lions tell the difference between objects less than two centimeters different in size.', '02:55': 'With these tools a healthy sea lion can catch generous helpings of fish such as anchovy, mackerel, and squid on every outing. And with their exceptional memories, they can remember multiple hunting grounds, including those they haven’t visited in decades. This memory also extends to breeding territories and birthing areas, as well as which neighbors are friend and foe. There’s even evidence that sea lions can remember how to perform tasks after 10 years with no practice in between, letting them navigate old stomping grounds with ease.', '03:28': 'Yet despite these incredible adaptations, there are changes unfolding in their habitats too rapidly for sea lions to handle. As climate change warms the oceans, certain toxic algae species thrive. This algae is harmless to the fish who eat it, but for the sea lions which ingest those fish, the algae’s domoic acid can trigger seizures and brain damage. Changing ocean conditions keep this algae blooming year round, causing more and more sea lions to wash up on beaches.', '03:59': 'This tragic discovery is just one of the many ways the health of aquatic animal communities can help us better understand Earth’s oceans. These red flags help us take action to protect ourselves and other maritime mammals. And the more we can learn about the changing ocean that sea lions inhabit, the better equipped we’ll be to help these clever creatures thrive.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the bad backs, elbow pain, and creaky knees so common in older people is more than just “old age."" In fact, the source of this stiffness plagues many young people as well. The culprit is arthritis: a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the joints of over 90 million people in the U.S. alone. But are stiff, creaky joints really inevitable? What makes arthritis so pervasive, and why haven’t we found a cure for this widespread condition?', '00:48': 'The first hurdle is that arthritis is actually a spectrum of over 100 different arthritic conditions. All these conditions share symptoms of joint pain and inflammation, but the origin and severity of those symptoms vary widely.', '01:03': 'Even the most common type, osteoarthritis, is trickier to prevent than one might think. It’s a general misconception that arthritis is confined to old age. The origins of osteoarthritis can often be traced to a patient’s early life, from any seemingly ordinary joint injury. Following impact, immune cells rush in to help clean and repair the damaged site and begin pumping out enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases. These enzymes clear out the damaged tissue and contribute to inflammation. But while this rapid swelling helps protect the joint during recovery, inadequately healed tissue can cause these immune cells to overstay their welcome. The continuing flood of enzymes starts to degrade the cartilage, weakening the joint and leading to arthritis later on.', '01:49': 'Not all forms of arthritis can simply be traced to an old sports injury. Take rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 1.3 million U.S. adults. This condition is actually an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies target natively produced proteins, some of which are secreted by cartilage cells. We still don’t know what causes this behavior, but the result is that the body treats joint tissue like a foreign invader. Immune cells infiltrate the joint despite there being no tissue damage to repair. This response leads to chronic inflammation, which destroys bone and cartilage.', '02:24': 'Yet another condition, spondyloarthritis, has similarities to both of the conditions we’ve covered. Patients experience continuous inflammation in the joints and at the sites where ligaments and tendons attach to bones, even without any initial injury. This leads to the flood of enzymes and degradation seen in osteoarthritis, but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cytokines. As the enzymes eat away at cartilage, the body attempts to stabilize smaller joints by fusing them together. This process sometimes leads to outgrowths called bone spurs, which also cause intense stiffness and joint pain.', '03:02': 'With so many factors causing arthritis, our current treatments are tailored to tackle specific symptoms rather than underlying causes. These range from promising MACI techniques, which harvest cells from small pieces of cartilage to grow replacement tissue. To a technique called microfracture, where surgeons create small holes in the bone, allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new cartilage. As a last resort, people with withered cartilage can even undergo full joint replacements.', '03:30': 'But outside these drastic measures, the underlying drivers of autoimmune arthritis still present a unique treatment challenge. Scientists are making progress with therapies that block TNF-alpha, one of the primary proteins causing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. But even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition, not the cause.', '03:52': 'In the meantime, some of our best defenses against arthritis are lifestyle choices: maintaining a healthy weight to take pressure off joints, low-impact exercises like yoga or cycling, and avoiding smoking.

The people of the wall spend their days gathering up works of art and literature, from all across the land. On feeding day, the furnace-bots arrive, ravenous. If they eat, the lights stay on, and the food gets delivered. If they starve, the people do too.', '01:06': 'Hedge’s fuel supply runs out just as he and Ethic reach the outskirts of town, and they come in for a crash landing. Luckily, everyone is too busy preparing for the feeding to notice.', '01:21': 'Today’s feeding is where Ethic can find the leader of an underground resistance movement. This person knows the location of the first of three powerful artifacts. The problem is, Hedge and Ethic don’t know the resistance leader’s name or appearance. But Hedge has gathered the following information:', '01:40': 'The leader has green eyes. If the leader has red hair, their name has at least one consecutive double letter. If the leader wear glasses, their name has exactly 2 vowels. Otherwise, their name has exactly 3 vowels. There is exactly one person for whom these are all true.', '02:03': 'As a fugitive, Ethic can’t sneak into the crowd without drawing attention to herself. But she can give instructions to Hedge. And one tool she has is what programmers call a conditional. That’s a statement of the form “If A, then B.” Flowcharts are great illustrations of how those work. This conditional translates to: if A is true, carry out instruction B. There are also conditionals that account for different possibilities. This says, “If A is true, perform instruction B. Otherwise, carry out instruction C.”', '02:39': 'So what instructions does she give Hedge so he can find the resistance leader?', '02:44': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '02:49': 'With a problem like this, it can help to simplify first. What if Hedge just has to examine this one person? What information does he need to collect about her?', '03:00': 'He might ask, “Does she have green eyes?” What other questions should Hedge ask to find the resistance leader, and how can he track those answers?', '03:11': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '03:16': 'It may seem intuitive how you’d approach this problem as a human. But Hedge isn’t a human, and so the challenge comes from needing to give him systematic instructions that will work in any scenario.', '03:29': 'Hedge needs to examine the settlers, one at a time, until he discovers the right person. In other words, like with the lock on the prison cell, this is a loop that repeats the same instructions. Only this time the loop will involve a series of questions in the form of conditionals, and will end as soon as Hedge finds his target.', '03:51': 'But first, you’ll want to organize your information. Each person has a set of characteristics: Eye color, hair color, glasses, and name.', '04:01': 'Does this person have green eyes? If so, mark a check next to “eye color."" If not, mark an X there.', '04:08': 'If they have red hair, does their name contain a double letter? If so, mark a check next to “hair color.” If they don’t have a double letter, mark an X next to “hair color.” Anyone with red hair and no double letter can’t be the resistance leader. But notice that if they have blue hair, Hedge will skip this question and go on to the next one.', '04:31': 'For the last question, we can say, “If they wear glasses, does their name have exactly 2 vowels? If they don’t have glasses, does their name have exactly 3 vowels?” There will be people in the crowd with glasses and 1 vowel, or no glasses and 2 vowels. But they’re not who we’re looking for, so they’ll get X’s.', '04:54': 'The resistance leader must be someone with either check marks or blanks next to every question. Blanks are ok, because if someone has blue hair, the rule about red hair doesn’t apply to them.', '05:07': 'You could have Hedge ask every question about every person, and then choose the person with only checks and blanks. But there’s a way to save yourself lots of time: as soon as Hedge marks an X, have him move on to the next person. You don’t need to know the answer to every question; just one X means they’re not the target of your search.', '05:32': 'Hedge buzzes through the crowd, and within minutes finds Adila, the resistance leader, and brings her back to Ethic.', '05:39': 'Adila agrees to help them steal the first artifact— the node of power— but under one condition: that Ethic and Hedge jump-start the revolution by reprogramming the furnace-bots that terrorize the town. And right on cue, the robots descend.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were absolute truths, until ... they weren't. Which of our accepted truths will fall apart in the years ahead? Financier-turned-philosopher Yannick Roudaut believes we're on the cusp of another historical reckoning -- and another renaissance.",,,365938,2019-02-15T23:01:16+00:00,"['future', 'philosophy', 'economics', 'finance', 'science']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', '日本語']",Yannick Roudaut,"Philosopher, author, entrepreneur","{'0:00': 'Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I knew everything about finance, for sure. I knew the global economy because it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that I knew like the back of my hand I didn\'t really believe in them. In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred, you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster. The whole conception I had of the world, all the certainties that I had until then, were all fallen apart within a few months. That\'s why I\'m here tonight, I\'ve realized that, finally, it wasn\'t all so bad, and that it was an opportunity because we have the exceptional opportunity of living in an exceptional period of human history: we are going to change the world. But before changing the world, we have to do something, we have to do some grieving, we have to turn the page - turning the page of the world we live in today. To do so, I need some help from an American who goes by the name of Jared Diamond and who published ""Collapse,"" and soon you will see that the 5 factors of the collapse of civilizations are reunited today. Jared Diamond has identified 5 factors in which we find the collapse of the Mayas, the Vikings, and all of the great Mesopotamian civilizations. And every time, those 5 factors were reunited. The bad news is that the 5 factors are reunited only at the beginning of the 21st century, but this time not only a single civilization is threatened but the global village, humanity, all of us. It\'s extremely important to be aware of this. The first factor of the collapse is the environmental factor. For two centuries, especially the last 50 years, we have done environmental damage, sometimes irreversible. The second factor is climate change. All the great civilizations did face those changes in climate. This weakens the ecosystems, that weakening also results in shortage of resources, destabilization of a society economical, geopolitical, social consequences, you name it. Third factor, still reunited today, the revival of military conflicts. These two first factors result in: when the ecosystems are destabilized and there is a shortage of resources, we continue having conflicts, we make war. And let me remind you, at the moment France is at war in Mali; let\'s not forget that. Fourth factor, equally important than the last one, the cancellation of diplomatic and commercial alliances. Things look bad, and the alliances concluded yesterday are undermined. Today, we are all aware of the fact that the future of Europe is unknown, we don\'t know what will come. And the fifth factor, not the least worrisome: the blindness of our elites. In this whole collapse of the civilization, the elites are not able to evaluate the fall of their world. They are incapable of changing their prism for the analysis. And the result? The result is simple: we will have a political caste system which emphasizes, which accelerates the collapse of a world. After everything I just told you, you have to know that the end of a world is not the same as the end of the world. If I told you that we live in an extraordinary time, extraordinary in the sense of etymology, there is no doubt, we live in a transition period, between two worlds. In the world of today, we are about to turn the page. And the world of tomorrow, the world to come, the sustainable world, about which I am talking today, starts to slighty assume its shape but there is still nothing precise. How do we live? We live in a historical period inspiring enough that we have to reinvent things. The nearest time period, in which man reinvented everything, is the Renaissance. The question which comes up in the 21st century is, ""Do we experience a new Renaissance?"" Let\'s see if the factors of a renaissance are reunited. First factor of a renaissance is a new understanding of the world. In the 15th century, Columbus discovered the Americas, man discovered the immensity of planet Earth, we discovered the immensity of the world. What happens at the moment, for some decades, for some years? We discover the finiteness of the world. The planet is very small in terms of resources, capacity, if we look at the current economic model. New understanding. Second factor: The Renaissance is a period of very much creativity. We all know Leonardo da Vinci, the Flemish painters. 2012, 2013, what has happened? Very much creativity. 3D printing is only one example. There are lots of others. Third factor of the Renaissance: Contrary to common beliefs, the Renaissance was not only a period of creativity, but also of much violence: religious wars, civil wars, extermination of the Native Americans, slavery. And how is it in 2012, 2013? Violence on a daily basis, and children which get killed in school by automatic weapons. Fourth factor of a renaissance: The whole world knows Gutenberg the inventor of the printing press who fundamentally changed the distribution of knowledge in Europe, and later in the rest of the world. Imagine, today, there is a new technological tool which allows us to distribute knowledge in a whole new way. This tool, which we have in our hands, provides instantaneous information. We hold the knowledge of the world in our hands. Soon, we will see how this is going to change. And finally, a renaissance - that brings me to the subject of today - it\'s the fact that all the certainties of humanity have fallen apart. Let me remind you, from Aristoteles through Ptolemy in the 2nd century to the Renaissance, the Earth was flat, man was the center of the world, and the stars turned around us. And those who dared to question this unique thought, those who dared to dispute this received, non-negotiable truth, - you know what came next - had to deal with the Inquisition. At the stake, they had to answer the question. Copernicus and Galilee had nearly paid with their lives because they dared to say that the Earth was not flat and it was not the center of the universe. So today, the question presenting itself to us in the 21st century is: ""Are we committing the same mistake as our ancestors? Are we, also in making the mistake, or in our certainties, the ones who will fall apart over the next few years?"" The next question which follows is: ""What are those certainties which are of received and non-negotiable value, which could fall apart in 10, 15, 20, or 50 years?"" There are a lot of them. As a former economist, there are at least three certainties in economy. At first, there is the truth that growth is the only motor of the economy. Let me remind you what the word \'economy\' means in Greek. Economy means resource management, domain and household management. So it doesn\'t necessarily mean growth. It\'s not a synonym. Second truth which could fall apart is that growth is infinite. That\'s our consumption model in a finite and increasingly shrinking world as the population grows more and more but with less resources. And we don\'t question this dogma. Third dogma, third received truth is the necessary sacrifice of the living in favor of this growth. But still, we have authorized the right to pollute, to right to poison, the right to intoxicate. Why? Because growth demands it. The question that we are confronted with today is: If we continue like this, if we continue to sacrify the living, do we challenge this, will we authorize this dialogue? The answer is also not that evident because we can ask ourselves if the people who question these dogmas of growth as motor of the economy, and of the myth of infinite growth are today maybe still seen like yesterday\'s heretics. I must say that I am not sure, that at this time, in the 21st century, we show a great wisdom to those who dare to question a system which we all benefit from. It should be extremely important for us to keep an open mind. And yet, we become more and more people. All here, I think, are convinced of the fact that we know that the road we have taken for two centuries leads us directly to - how did the philosopher Jonas say? To a tragic impasse. The economic development on which we base our model leads us to a tragic impasse. Hans Jonas adds a very beautiful expression: ""Nature will eventually make its ultimate veto, anyway, and it will be over."" After what I just said, another question arises I am concerned with personally: ""What will our children and descendants think of our behavior, our stubbornness of our obsession of a destructive economic model?"" It is very likely that they will call us perhaps barbarians of the living world, and maybe they will feel the same contempt, the same indignation which we can feel today about those who developed slavery two or three centuries ago. Our behavior today is not any better than that of those we despise today. Why? Because three centuries ago, slavery was non-negotiable. The European and American economic model was based on slavery. And today, in 2013, what happens? Our entire economic model, our entire society is based on what? On exploitation, on the sacrifice of the living. The question, which, of course, arises is, ""What are we going to do?"" But before we know what we will do we have to know why we got there in order not to commit the same mistake in tomorrow\'s world. And how did we get there? The answer is simple and can be said in a few words. The philosopher Descartes already said it four centuries ago: ""Man is the only master and owner of nature."" Period. We dominate nature, we shape and form it. We do what we want. But what has happened since this Cartesian thought? We consider nature as a bottomless pit, as a mine where we draw from and throw things. And that\'s the problem. We consider this kind of nature as what? Finally, that puts man outside of nature. And this exteriority is our problem. In 1990, Michel Serres had an extremely truthful thought, like always, he said: ""But finally, the notion of nature is a problem for us because nature assumes that man is put into, surrounded by a living world. We are disconnected from nature. As long as we haven\'t solved that problem, as long as we haven\'t reconciled with nature, it won\'t work. It\'s not about sacralizing nature, or putting it on an altar like a sacred goddess, it\'s just about including nature and not acting against or without it."" Well, how are we going to do that? The conclusion of my talk is we\'ll have to organize it, really simple. It\'s extremely simple, we need a new controversy. What is a controversy? It\'s a dispute, a global debate. What happened in Valladolid in the 16th century, in 1550? A dispute took place in Spain as to whether Native Americans are living beings or not. Because if we exploited this tame workforce for free, we would develop the New World. If they were human beings we couldn\'t make them slaves. That would be intolerable. So, we discussed about the humanity of Native Americans. In the 21st century, we need to organize a new controversy. But this time it will be about determining where are the tolerance limits towards nature compared to human activity. What can nature bear? What kind of economic model can it bear? Do we have the right to pollute, the right to destroy the future of our children and their common heritage? This new controversy allows us to draft the Universal Declaration on the Duties of Man towards Nature. Yes, I said duties. Why? The Declaration on Human Rights has been the corner stone of the modern world, of today\'s world. The Universal Declaration on the Duties of Man will be the cornerstone of the new tomorrow. The declaration will fix the limits of our activity. But how to launch this new controversy? It needs to be organized. But before organizing and launching it, you will tell me: ""Roudaut has taken drugs. He\'s a utopian. He lives in an ivory tower. it\'s all in his fantasy."" Once more, I go back to history. Who would have thought before Constantin and Theodosius I that the Romans would see their empire destroyed by a handful of people from inside called Christians? Who would have thought before the French Revolution and the end of the monarchy that a handful of men would write the Universal Declaration on Human Rights? Today, those who reflect about another world, who strive for new values, are perhaps - perhaps you and I are - the first Christians of the Roman Empire. We may be about to change the things from inside through the only aspiration of our values to another world. How to organize this new controversy? That\'s very simple because of an unprecedented challenge, we have a new tool in our hands, and that\'s connection. We are all connected, and that will change everything. The fact that we are connected allows us to launch a controversy to consider the world of tomorrow. I finish my talk with this connection, as from tonight on, I suggest to launch the first tweet about the new controversy. Here and now in Nantes, here we go, sent. I invite you to continue the debate without me, after or with me. Thank you.

You've seen this in sci-fi movies: machines that can read our thoughts. However, there are devices today that can read the electrical activity from our brains. We call this the EEG. Is there information contained in these brainwaves? And if so, could we train a computer to read our thoughts?"", '00:26': 'My buddy Nathan has been working to hack the EEG to build a mind-reading machine.', '00:31': '[DIY Neuroscience]', '00:34': ""So this is how the EEG works. Inside your head is a brain, and that brain is made out of billions of neurons. Each of those neurons sends an electrical message to each other. These small messages can combine to make an electrical wave that we can detect on a monitor. Now traditionally, the EEG can tell us large-scale things, for example if you're asleep or if you're alert. But can it tell us anything else? Can it actually read our thoughts? We're going to test this, and we're not going to start with some complex thoughts. We're going to do something very simple. Can we interpret what someone is seeing using only their brainwaves?"", '01:05': ""Nathan's going to begin by placing electrodes on Christy's head."", '01:08': 'Nathan: My life is tangled.', '01:10': '(Laughter)', '01:11': ""GG: And then he's going to show her a bunch of pictures from four different categories."", '01:15': 'Nathan: Face, house, scenery and weird pictures.', '01:18': ""GG: As we show Christy hundreds of these images, we are also capturing the electrical waves onto Nathan's computer. We want to see if we can detect any visual information about the photos contained in the brainwaves, so when we're done, we're going to see if the EEG can tell us what kind of picture Christy is looking at, and if it does, each category should trigger a different brain signal."", '01:37': ""OK, so we collected all the raw EEG data, and this is what we got. It all looks pretty messy, so let's arrange them by picture. Now, still a bit too noisy to see any differences, but if we average the EEG across all image types by aligning them to when the image first appeared, we can remove this noise, and pretty soon, we can see some dominant patterns emerge for each category."", '02:00': ""Now the signals all still look pretty similar. Let's take a closer look. About a hundred milliseconds after the image comes on, we see a positive bump in all four cases, and we call this the P100, and what we think that is is what happens in your brain when you recognize an object. But damn, look at that signal for the face. It looks different than the others. There's a negative dip about 170 milliseconds after the image comes on."", '02:22': 'What could be going on here? Research shows that our brain has a lot of neurons that are dedicated to recognizing human faces, so this N170 spike could be all those neurons firing at once in the same location, and we can detect that in the EEG.', '02:36': ""So there are two takeaways here. One, our eyes can't really detect the differences in patterns without averaging out the noise, and two, even after removing the noise, our eyes can only pick up the signals associated with faces."", '02:48': 'So this is where we turn to machine learning. Now, our eyes are not very good at picking up patterns in noisy data, but machine learning algorithms are designed to do just that, so could we take a lot of pictures and a lot of data and feed it in and train a computer to be able to interpret what Christy is looking at in real time?', '03:06': ""We're trying to code the information that's coming out of her EEG in real time and predict what it is that her eyes are looking at. And if it works, what we should see is every time that she gets a picture of scenery, it should say scenery, scenery, scenery, scenery. A face -- face, face, face, face, but it's not quite working that way, is what we're discovering."", '03:30': '(Laughter)', '03:34': 'OK.', '03:35': ""Director: So what's going on here? GG: We need a new career, I think."", '03:39': '(Laughter)', '03:40': ""OK, so that was a massive failure. But we're still curious: How far could we push this technology? And we looked back at what we did. We noticed that the data was coming into our computer very quickly, without any timing of when the images came on, and that's the equivalent of reading a very long sentence without spaces between the words. It would be hard to read, but once we add the spaces, individual words appear and it becomes a lot more understandable."", '04:04': ""But what if we cheat a little bit? By using a sensor, we can tell the computer when the image first appears. That way, the brainwave stops being a continuous stream of information, and instead becomes individual packets of meaning. Also, we're going to cheat a little bit more, by limiting the categories to two. Let's see if we can do some real-time mind-reading."", '04:23': 'In this new experiment, we\'re going to constrict it a little bit more so that we know the onset of the image and we\'re going to limit the categories to ""face"" or ""scenery.""', '04:32': 'Nathan: Face. Correct. Scenery. Correct.', '04:37': ""GG: So right now, every time the image comes on, we're taking a picture of the onset of the image and decoding the EEG. It's getting correct."", '04:45': 'Nathan: Yes. Face. Correct.', '04:47': 'GG: So there is information in the EEG signal, which is cool. We just had to align it to the onset of the image.', '04:52': 'Nathan: Scenery. Correct. Face. Yeah.', '04:58': 'GG: This means there is some information there, so if we know at what time the picture came on, we can tell what type of picture it was, possibly, at least on average, by looking at these evoked potentials.', '05:10': 'Nathan: Exactly.', '05:11': 'GG: If you had told me at the beginning of this project this was possible, I would have said no way. I literally did not think we could do this.', '05:18': ""Did our mind-reading experiment really work? Yes, but we had to do a lot of cheating. It turns out you can find some interesting things in the EEG, for example if you're looking at someone's face, but it does have a lot of limitations. Perhaps advances in machine learning will make huge strides, and one day we will be able to decode what's going on in our thoughts. But for now, the next time a company says that they can harness your brainwaves to be able to control devices, it is your right, it is your duty to be skeptical.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That technology is simulating humans. It\'s simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. Now, before I talk more about that technology, let\'s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games. This is a clip from a game called ""Grand Theft Auto 3."" We already saw that briefly yesterday. And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game. It\'s one of the most successful games of all time. But what you\'ll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. They pretty much look the same. I\'ve made him run into a wall here, over and over again. And you can see he looks always the same. The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters. They are a graphical visualization of a character.', '01:08': ""To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game, and then has to animate that particular sequence. So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen, and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity. All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times. It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be, because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character, what you actually put into it. There's no real emergence there."", '01:51': ""And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that. Now, the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body. And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because, I mean, it's very, very trivial. If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it. If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently, and that's because he has a physical body, and because he has the motor skills to control that body. It's a very trivial thing. It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?"", '02:30': ""Torsten Reil: That's it, yes. So, that's what we're trying to simulate -- not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general. Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University, and we tried to start very simply. What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk. That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen. So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc. If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this. The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work. And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans. It's called the central pattern generator. So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms."", '03:21': ""We heard about those already yesterday, and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already. But, just briefly, the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks, in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning. You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting. At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring. Most of them won't move at all, but some of them might make a tiny step. Those are then selected by the algorithm, reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. And you repeat that process over and over again, until you have something that walks -- in this case, in a straight line, like this. So that was the idea behind this. When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening. It took about three to four hours to run the simulation. I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results, and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line, like I've just demonstrated, and this is what I got instead."", '04:20': '(Laughter)', '04:30': ""So, it was back to the drawing board for us. We did get it to work eventually, after tweaking a bit here and there. And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run. So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution. At the beginning, it can't walk at all, but it will get better and better over time. So, this is the one that can't walk at all."", '04:57': '(Laughter)', '05:03': 'Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process, the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.', '05:09': '(Laughter)', '05:17': ""Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there. But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over. That was the real breakthrough for us. It was, academically, quite a challenging project, and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds. What you see here is the character standing there, and there's an obstacle that we put in its way. And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle. Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way. And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently."", '06:21': '(Laughter)', '06:23': ""Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there, are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. Okay. That's the video. Thanks. Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds. Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further, because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped. What we really wanted was a full human body. So we started the company. We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body, basically. It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine, but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically."", '07:07': ""So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing, and tried to make it as realistic as possible. What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc., but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization, so you can concentrate on the movement. Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment, is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. Nothing really interesting, basically. It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically. The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it. So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one. But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again. It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. It's going to stick out its hands. It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall. So that's what you see here."", '08:14': ""Now, it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. So here, we've got the same character. I'm going to push it a bit harder now, harder than I just pushed Chris. But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left. What you see is it takes steps backwards, it tries to counter-balance, it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. I'll show you this again. And then, finally hits the floor. Now, this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done. That's something that you cannot do right now. At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games. What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now."", '09:05': ""So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you, but now I'm just going to push it from different directions. First, starting with a push from the right. This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on. Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit, so you can see that the reaction is different. Again, a push, now this time from the front. And you see it falls differently. And now from the left -- and it falls differently. That was really exciting for us to see that. That was the first time we've seen that. This is the first time the public sees this as well, because we have been in stealth mode. I haven't shown this to anybody yet. Now, just a fun thing: what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice. We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens."", '09:58': '(Laughter)', '09:59': 'And this is what happens.', '10:01': '(Laughter)', '10:04': '(Applause)', '10:07': ""It's nothing we had to do about this. We just took this character that I just talked about, put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it. And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach. Now, when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology, we got a very good response. And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen. Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive, and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously, because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months. And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks. So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. That's what people want. That's what we're giving them."", '10:54': '(Laughter)', '11:01': ""You can see, it's always reacting. This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case, feels the force and tries to protect its head. Only, I think it's quite a big blow again. You feel kind of sorry for that thing, and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more."", '11:17': '(Laughter)', '11:18': ""There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ... Now, here's another one. What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion, a strong force applied to the character, and have the character react to it in midair. So that you don't have a character that looks limp, but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away, that looks kind of alive in midair as well. So this character is going to be hit by a force, it's going to realize it's in the air, and it's going to try and, well, stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing. That's one angle; here's another angle. We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films."", '11:58': ""And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization. This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London, who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw, but in a slightly better rendered version. So if you look at the character carefully, you see there are lots of body movements going on, none of which you have to animate like in the old days. Animators had to actually animate them. This is all happening automatically in the simulation. This is a slightly different angle, and again a slow motion version of this. This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes, change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it. At the moment, doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days."", '12:47': ""This is another behavior they requested. I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway. It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach. In this case, the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space, and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. And it looks organic. It looks realistic. You feel kind of sorry for the guy. It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically."", '13:15': ""Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look. And this is all a physical simulation of the body, using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body. Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene, and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee. Got a very short clip here."", '13:46': 'Yes, you can just about see it here. In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt. It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts. Now, we\'ve just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves, ""Can we do that ourselves as well?"" Can we use the physical simulation of the character, use artificial intelligence, put that artificial intelligence into the character, drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam, and then skydive afterwards, and have him caught by a bungee afterwards? We did that. It took about altogether just two hours, pretty much, to create the simulation. And that\'s what it looks like, here. Now, this could do with a bit more work. It\'s still very early stages, and we pretty much just did this for a laugh, just to see what we\'d get out of it. But what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we\'re pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful. We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations. There\'s very often very surprising behavior that you didn\'t predict before.', '14:51': ""There's so many things we can do with this right now. The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen. Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen, and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually, for some major productions. The second thing is video games. With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different. For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive, that have real bodies that really react. I think that's going to be incredibly exciting. Probably starting with sports games, which are going to become much more interactive. But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds, like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us. The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now."", '15:36': ""A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation. We've been approached by several simulation companies, but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month, is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy, to predict the outcome of operations on these children. As you probably know, it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait."", '16:04': ""The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best, is what people think right now, is the outcome. Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool. We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait, before he actually commits to an actual surgery. That's one project we're particularly excited about, and that's going to start next month. Just finally, this is only just the beginning. We can only do several behaviors right now. The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body. The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have. And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. Right now, we don't have that but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage."", '16:49': ""We do have one unintentional dancer actually, the last thing I'm going to show you. This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically. So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance. That's what we thought was going to come out of this. But this is what emerged out of it, in the end."", '17:09': '(Music)', '17:19': ""Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why. So, this was not something we actually put in there. He just started to create that dance himself. He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say. And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. And I think -- there you go."", '17:44': '(Laughter)', '17:46': ""So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there. That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically. So it's just --"", '17:53': '(Applause)', '17:54': ""Thanks. Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well, so thanks very much for your time. Thanks."", '18:03': '(Applause)', '18:04': 'CA: Incredible. That was really incredible.', '18:06': 'TR: Thanks.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No country buys more sneakers than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved and for our planet.', '01:08': 'Shoe manufacturing accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker.', '01:33': 'For starters, the heel, insole, midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy, further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from natural sources like leather, but tanning this material relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage freshwater ecosystems.', '02:10': 'The outer soles of most shoes are made of rubber that’s gone through a process called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil.', '02:36': 'Producing these materials accounts for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing every part under one roof. But the transportation required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2.', '03:11': 'Once the components arrive at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% of a sneaker’s environmental impact.', '03:32': 'The dispersion of factories fuels another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own or operate their factories, so the plants they work with are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, like toxic glue fumes.', '03:55': 'When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years to degrade.', '04:28': 'So, how can we balance our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all take steps towards a sustainable future.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone, where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't. We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.

I've been a civil servant, and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well."", '01:35': 'But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.

And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts. And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy, but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects. And when people aren't allowed to be useful, they soon think that they're useless. And although that was great for the music business at the time, it wasn't much good for anything else.

Unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but that growth hasn\'t always delivered what we needed. H.L. Mencken once said that, ""to every complex problem, there is a simple solution and it\'s wrong."" But I\'m not saying growth is wrong, but it\'s very striking that throughout the years of growth, many things didn\'t get better. Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world. If you look at America, the proportion of Americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter. We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph, the longer you commute the less happy you\'re likely to be. And it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn\'t automatically translate into social growth or human growth.', '03:38': ""We're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.

They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream. They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms. And you saw that in the '30s, when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on. And I think you can see around us now, some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. You can see it in daily life. When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves, and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk, you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming, people taking over land, taking over roofs, turning barges into temporary farms."", '04:56': ""And I'm a very small part of this. I have 60,000 of these things in my garden. A few of these. This is Atilla the hen. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement, which for some people is about survival, but is also about values, about a different kind of economy, which isn't so much about consumption and credit, but about things which matter to us. And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies, people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land -- and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs."", '05:34': 'There\'s a similar story, I think, for governments. Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences in the English language are, ""I\'m from the government. And I\'m here to help."" But I think last year when governments did step in, people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act. But now, a few months on, however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face, as someone once put it, they can\'t hide their uncertainty. Because it\'s already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy, really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies, not preparing us for the future. How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption, not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.', '06:21': 'And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children\'s money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they\'re asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society, for people able to create the new, not to the big, well-connected companies, big, clunky government programs. And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said, ""Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish. Don\'t overdo it.""', '07:06': ""And I think more and more people are also asking: Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume? Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards, or the many cities like San Francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars. You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world. Some, I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts, like cars and aerospace and so on."", '07:41': ""The biggest sector, by far, will be health -- already 18 percent of the American economy, predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century. Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars. Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing. Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs, they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks, and it's founded above all on care, on relationships, on what people do to other people, often one to one, rather than simply selling them a product."", '08:23': ""And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society, the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one. We know our societies have to radically change. We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis. But we also know it's only through experiment that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city, how to care for a much older population, how to deal with drug addiction and so on."", '08:55': ""And here's the problem. In science, we do experiments systematically. Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology, to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this. It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are, but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. And what's striking though, is that in society there's almost nothing comparable, no comparable investment, no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at, like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care."", '09:38': ""Now, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated. He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions, its welfare state, its economy, but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur, became an inventor of many, many different organizations. Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students, the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people, as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists."", '10:22': ""He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act, you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers, not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs, which were usually the people living with those needs. And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too, not doing things at people, for them, and so on."", '11:01': ""Now, what he did didn't used to have a name, but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream. It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures, whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on. And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation, using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory. And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA and across Europe. And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers to joblessness, community breakdown and so on."", '11:52': 'Some of the ideas are strange. These are complaints choirs. People come together to sing about the things that really bug them. (Laughter) Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs. And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital, and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.', '12:20': 'Now, the idea that all of this represents, I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis, recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country, as well as a public service innovation lab. Across northern Europe, many governments now have innovation laboratories within them. And just a few months ago, President Obama launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.', '12:50': ""And what people are beginning to ask is: Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent, of our GDP, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled? Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society to those we've had in the economy and in technology."", '13:15': ""And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon, perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking, or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe, why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens. Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade, but only with radical and systematic experiment, not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too."", '13:51': ""Now, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism. I think what this is all about, this whole movement which is growing from the margins, remains quite small. Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont. What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social. It's already immersed in social networks. It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption. But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work."", '14:43': ""Now, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people. In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won. History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy. But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France."", '15:11': ""Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature. We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy. Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature, only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on. Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy, which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment, just as capitalism has seen off socialism. Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism. And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident, today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city."", '15:59': ""I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost, though that might be quite tempting. But I do think we're on the verge of a period when, just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too, the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end, and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society, transformed from being a master into a servant, a servant to the productive economy and of human needs."", '16:30': ""And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system. It depends on other systems, on ecology, on family, on community, and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too. And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate. It's not just competitive, it's also caring. Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice."", '17:05': ""The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us. It will be worse at the end of this year, quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago, and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for, or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway. Thank you."", '17:36': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thulasiraj Ravilla looks at the ingenious approach that drives its treatment costs down and quality up, and why its methods should trigger a re-think of all human services.",0:17:12,17.2,363604,2009-12-09T16:30:00+00:00,"['design', 'health', 'health care', 'humanity', 'medicine', 'public health', 'sight', 'technology']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'हिन्दी', 'ગુજરાતી', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Thulasiraj Ravilla,Vision activist,"{'00:04': ""Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind."", '00:28': '(Music)', '00:32': ""Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman? I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either."", '00:46': ""Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be."", '01:03': ""A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people. Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them."", '01:29': 'So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.', '02:08': 'The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries. A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.', '02:49': 'And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation.', '03:10': '(Music)', '03:18': 'Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.', '04:06': '(Applause)', '04:12': ""This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's."", '04:30': ""Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places."", '04:54': ""Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's."", '05:11': ""Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone."", '05:23': ""TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same. And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues."", '05:54': ""And then so, one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma."", '06:42': ""And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital."", '07:23': 'And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.', '07:52': '(Applause)', '07:58': ""And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem? We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems."", '08:25': 'So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.', '08:51': ""The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people. And the second year went up to 75 percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital."", '09:17': ""And how much will they pay for this? We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations."", '09:30': '(Applause)', '09:33': 'The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care? We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence.', '10:09': ""So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market."", '10:21': ""The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists? So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon."", '10:53': 'And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.', '11:29': '(Applause)', '11:35': ""This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems. As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often."", '11:53': '(Applause)', '11:55': ""So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior, even now. And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus."", '12:25': ""The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA."", '12:47': '(Applause)', '12:55': 'But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well.', '13:42': ""The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology? There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries."", '14:15': ""To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about 300,000. And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. (Laughter)"", '15:00': '(Applause)', '15:06': ""So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice. So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again."", '15:44': '(Laughter)', '15:48': 'Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side.', '16:21': ""Now, how do you create compassion? Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it? There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these."", '16:33': 'So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.', '16:36': 'Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.', '16:50': 'TR: Thank you very much.', '16:52': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine, Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely. Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. It took us 33 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to get there. We shaved five days off the previous best time. And in the process, I became the first person in history to make the entire 650-mile journey, from Hercules Inlet to South Pole, solely on feet, without skis.', '00:43': 'Now, many of you are probably saying, ""Wait a sec, is this tough to do?"" (Laughter) Imagine, if you will, dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip, with 170 pounds of gear, in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek. It\'s going to be 40 below, every single day. You\'ll be in a massive headwind. And at some point you\'re going to have to cross these cracks in the ice, these crevasses. Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment\'s notice, taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again. The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon. Yes, it\'s uphill the entire way, because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet, and you\'re starting at sea level.', '01:29': 'Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet, where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica. It began a little less than two years ago. A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert. And while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa. We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa affected young people the most. I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand, and I said, ""You know, there\'s no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert, we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."" But if I\'m going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there.', '02:11': ""Around that time I met an extraordinary human being, Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions. He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world. His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition: a run to the South Pole where, with an interactive website, I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me, as active members. So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days, we would be blogging, telling stories of, you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces, or we will burn. Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi -- frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep. I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled, that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds, because that's what it felt like."", '02:59': ""We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well, about 10-hour trekking days, 15-hour trekking days, sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal. We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally. In turn, students, people from around the world, would ask us questions. Young people would ask the most amazing questions."", '03:22': ""One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom, where are you going to go and how are you going to do it? I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions."", '03:32': 'Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground, because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.', '03:39': ""What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition: butter and bacon. It's about a million calories. We were burning about 8,500 a day, so we needed it."", '03:50': 'How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have? Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment, was charged by the sun.', '03:58': 'And do you get along? I certainly hope so, because at some point or another on this expedition, one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle, and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.', '04:08': 'But seriously, seriously, we did get along, because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people. They were our teammates! They were inspiring us. The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole. The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication. Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school, dragging sleds across the school-yard, pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.', '04:34': 'We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent, 45 below that day, I\'ll never forget it. We looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed.

And let's go down to the water's edge, and you're going to notice is we're getting knocked around by the waves, and it's really difficult to stay in place. But now, look down, and what you're going to see is that the rocks are covered by all sorts of sea creatures that are just staying there in place, no problem. And it turns out that if you want to survive in this really demanding environment, your very existence is dependent upon your ability to make glue, actually."", '00:44': ""So let me introduce you to some of the heroes of our story, just a few of them. So these are mussels, and you'll notice they're covering the rocks. They've made adhesives, and they're sticking down on the rocks, and they're also sticking to each other, actually. So they're hunkered down together as a group."", '01:01': ""This is a close-up photograph of an oyster reef, and oysters, they're amazing. What they do is they cement to each other, and they build these huge, extensive reef systems. They can be kilometers long, they can be meters deep, and arguably, they're the most dominant influence on how healthy any coastal marine ecosystem is going to be, because what they do is they're filtering the water constantly, they're holding sand and dirt in place. Actually, other species live inside of these reefs. And then, if you think about what happens when a storm comes in, if the storm surge first has to hit miles of these reefs, the coast behind it is going to be protected. So they're really quite influential."", '01:41': ""If you've been to any rocky beach pretty much anywhere in the world, you're probably familiar with what barnacles look like. What these animals do -- and there's many others, these are just three of them -- is they make adhesives, they stick to each other, they stick to the rocks and they build communities, and by doing this, there's a lot of survival advantages they get. So one of them is that just any individual is subjected to less of the turbulence and all the damaging features that can happen from that environment. So they're all hunkered down there."", '02:10': ""Then, also, there's a safety in numbers thing, because it also helps you keep away the predators, because if, say, a seagull wants to pick you up and eat you, it's more difficult for the seagull if they're all stuck together."", '02:22': 'And then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency. So you can imagine that when Mr. and Mrs. Barnacle decide, ""OK, it\'s time to have little baby barnacles"" -- I won\'t tell you how they do that just yet -- but when they decide it\'s time to do that, it\'s a lot easier and their reproductive efficiency is higher if they\'re all living close together.', '02:42': ""So we want to understand how they do this, how do they stick, and I can't really tell you all the details, because it's something we're still trying to figure out, but let me give you a little flavor of some of the things that we're trying to do."", '02:56': ""This is a picture of one of the aquarium systems we have in our lab, and everything in the image is part of the system, and so what we do is we keep -- and you can see in the glass tank there in the bottom, there's a bunch of mussels, we have the water chilled, we have the lights cycled, we actually have turbulence in the system because the animals make more adhesives for us when the water is turbulent. So we induce them to make the adhesive, we collect it, we study it. They're here in Indiana. As far as they know, they're in Maine in February, and they seem to be pretty happy, as far as we can tell."", '03:28': ""And then we also work with oysters, and up top, it's a photo of a small reef in South Carolina, and what we're most interested in is seeing how they attach to each other, how they connect. And so what you can see in the bottom image is there's two oysters that are cementing to each other. And we want to know what's in between, and so a lot of times, we'll cut them and look down, and in the next series of images we have here, you can see, on the bottom, we'll have two shells, the shell of one animal and the shell of another animal, and the cement's in between. And if you look at the image on the right, what you can maybe see is that there's structure in the shell of each animal, but then, the cement actually looks different. And so we're using all sorts of fancy biology and chemistry tools to understand what's going on in there, and what we're finding is the structures are different and the chemistry is actually different, and it's quite interesting."", '04:20': 'And then this picture -- I guess let me step back before I tell you what this is. So do you know the cartoon ""The Magic School Bus""? Or if you\'re a little bit older, ""Fantastic Voyage,"" right? And you remember, they had these characters that they would shrink down to these microscopic levels, and then they would sort of swirl in and swim around and fly around all these biological structures? I think of this as like that, except for it\'s real, in this case. And so what we did is we have two oysters that are stuck together, and this area used to be completely filled in with the cement, and what we\'re finding is that the cement has lots of different components in there, but broadly speaking, there are hard, non-sticky parts and there are soft, sticky parts, and what we did is we removed the non-sticky parts selectively to see what\'s left for what\'s actually attaching the animals, and what we got is this, and we can see there\'s this sticky adhesive that\'s holding them together. And I just think it\'s a really cool image, because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there.', '05:20': ""Anyways, those are some of the things we're doing to understand how marine biology is making these materials. And from a fundamental perspective, it's really exciting to learn. But what we do want to do with this information? Well, there's a lot of technological applications if we can harness what the animals are doing."", '05:36': ""So let me give you one example. So imagine you're at home and you break your favorite figurine or a mug or something like that? You want to put it back together. So where do you go? You go to my favorite place in town, which is the glue aisle of the hardware store. I know where you spend your nights, because you're all hip, cool people, because you're here, and you're going to the bars and concerts -- this is where I hang out every night. So anyways, so what I want you to do is get one of every adhesive that's on the shelf, bring it home, but before you try to put things back together, I want you to try to do it in a bucket of water. It's not going to work, right? We all know this. So obviously, marine biology has solved this, so what we need to do is figure out ways to be able to copy this ourselves. And one of the issues here is, you can't just go and get the materials from the beach, because if you get a bunch of mussels and try to milk them for their adhesive, you'll get a little bit of material, but you're never going to have enough to do anything with, just enough to see. We need to scale this up, ideally maybe train car scale."", '06:39': ""So on the top is an image of one of the types of molecules that the animals are using to make their glue, and what they are is they're very long molecules, they're called proteins, and these proteins happen to have some fairly unique parts in them that bring about the adhesive properties. What we want to do is take those little parts of that chemistry, and we want to put it into other long molecules that we can get but things that we can make on a really large scale, so you might know them as plastics or polymers, and so we're sort of simplifying what they do, but then putting that adhesion chemistry into these large molecules."", '07:11': ""And we've developed many different adhesive systems in doing this, and when you make a new adhesive that looks pretty good, what do you do? You start running around the lab, just sticking stuff together. We took a tiny bit of a glue and glued together two pieces of metal and we wanted to hang something from it, so we used a pot of live mussels and thought we were very clever."", '07:30': '(Laughs)', '07:31': ""We're obviously much more quantitative about this most often, and so we benchmark against commercial adhesives, and we actually have some materials now that are stronger than superglue. So to me, that's really cool. That's a good day in the lab. It's stronger than superglue."", '07:46': ""And here's something else that we can do. So this is a tank of seawater, and then, in that syringe is one of our adhesive formulations, and what we're doing is we're dispensing it completely underwater, on a piece of metal. And then, we want to make an adhesive bond, or joint, and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it. And you want to let it set up for a while, give it a chance, so we'll just put a weight on it, nothing fancy. This is a tube with lead shot in it, nothing fancy. And then you let it sit for a while. So this has never seen air. It's completely underwater. And you pick it up. I never know what's going to happen. I'm always very anxious here. Pick it up ... and it's stuck."", '08:28': ""To me, this is really cool. So we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion. Possibly, it's the strongest or at least one of the strongest underwater adhesives that's ever been seen. It's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce, so for us, it's pretty exciting. It's pretty cool."", '08:45': ""So what do we want to do with these things? Well, here are some products that you're probably really familiar with. So think about your cell phone, your laptop, plywood in most structures, the interior of your car, shoes, phone books, things like this. They're all held together with adhesives, and there's two main problems with the adhesives used in these materials. The first one is that they're toxic. So the worst offender here is plywood. Plywood, or a lot of furniture, or wood laminate in floors -- a main component of the adhesives here is formaldehyde, and it's maybe a compound you've heard of. It's a gas, and it's also a carcinogen, and so we're constructing a lot of structures from these adhesives, and we're also breathing a lot of this carcinogen. So not good, obviously. Right? The other issue is that these adhesives are all permanent. And so what do you do with your shoes or your car or even your laptop at the end of life, when you're done using it? For the most part, they end up in landfills. And there's a lot of precious materials in there we'd love to be able to get out and recycle them. We can't do it so easily because they're all stuck together permanently."", '09:49': ""So here's one approach we're taking to try and solve some of these problems, and what we've done here is we've taken another long molecule that we can actually get from corn, and then into that molecule, we've put some of the adhesion chemistry from the mussels. So because we've got the corn and we've got the mussels, we call this our surf-and-turf polymer. And it sticks. It sticks really well. It's very strong. It's also bio-based. That's nice. But maybe more importantly, here, it's also degradable, and we can degrade it under very mild conditions, with water. And so what we can do is we can set things up and we can bond them strongly when we want, but then we can also take them apart. It's something we're thinking about."", '10:29': ""And here is a place where a lot of us want to be. Well, actually, in this specific case, this is a place we do not want to be, but we'd like to replace this. So sutures, staples, screws: this is how we put you back together if you've had some surgery or an injury. It's just awful. It hurts. In the case of the sutures, look at how much you're making concentrated, mechanical stresses as you pull things together. You're making sites for infection. Poke holes in healthy tissue. It's not so good."", '10:58': ""Or if you need a plate to hold together your bones, look at how much healthy bone you have to drill out just to hold the plate in place. So this is awful. To me, it looks like these were things devised in a medieval torture chamber, but it's our modern surgical joinery. So I'd love it if we could replace systems like these with adhesives. We're working on this, but this is not easy."", '11:20': ""So think about what you would need for adhesives in these cases. So first of all, you would need an adhesive that is going to set in a wet environment. And if you look at the silly little picture there, it's just to illustrate that our bodies are about 60 percent water, so it's a wet environment. It's also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist. I did not miss my calling at all."", '11:44': 'So then the other requirements you need for a good biomedical adhesive: it needs to bond strongly, of course, and it needs to not be toxic. You don\'t want to hurt the patients. And getting any two of those requirements in a material is pretty easy. It\'s been done many times. But getting all three hasn\'t been done. It\'s very hard. And if you start talking to surgeons, they get picky -- ""Oh, actually I want the adhesive to set on the same time frame as the surgery."" Or, ""Oh, I want the adhesive to degrade so the patient\'s tissues can remodel the site.""', '12:14': ""So this is really hard. We're working on it. This is just one image we have. So what we're doing is we're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft and hard tissue, and sometimes we'll whack it with a hammer. Usually, we're cutting it in precise shapes. And then we glue them back together."", '12:29': ""We've got some exciting results, some strong materials, some things that look like they're not toxic, they set wet, but I'm not going to tell you we've solved the wet adhesion problem, because we haven't, but it's certainly in our sights for the future. So that's one place that we'd like to see things go farther down the road. And there are a lot of other places, too, you can imagine we might be better off if we could get more adhesives in there. Even cosmetics. So if you think about people putting on fake nails or eyelash extensions, what do they use? They use very toxic adhesives right now. So it's just ripe for replacement. That's something we'd like to do."", '13:06': ""And then there are other places too. So think about cars and planes. The lighter you can make them, the more fuel-efficient they're going to be. And so if we can get away from rivets and get away from welding and put more adhesives in there, then we might be better off with our future generation of transportation."", '13:21': 'So for us, this all comes back to the beach. So we look around and we wonder, ""How do these sea creatures stick? And what can we do with the technology?"" And I would argue that we have really a lot of things we can still learn from biology and from nature.', '13:37': 'So what I would like to encourage you all to do in the future is put down your nonrecyclable laptops and cell phones and go out and explore the natural world and then start asking some of your own questions.', '13:50': 'Thanks very much.', '13:51': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My phone was ringing, I picked it up. The voice said, ""It\'s Rebecca. I\'m just calling to invite you to my funeral."" I said, ""Rebecca, what are you talking about?"" She said, ""Joy, as my friend, you have to let me go. It\'s my time."" The next day, she was dead.', '00:43': ""Rebecca was 31 years old when she died. She had an eight-year struggle with breast cancer. It came back three times. I failed her. The scientific community failed her. And the medical community failed her. And she's not the only one. Every five seconds, someone dies of cancer. Today, we medical researchers are committed to having Rebecca and people like her be one of the last patients that we fail."", '01:22': ""The US government alone has spent over 100 billion on cancer research since the 1970s, with limited progress in regards to patient survival, especially for certain types of very aggressive cancers. So we need a change because, clearly, what we've been doing so far has not been working."", '01:46': ""And what we do in medicine is to send out firefighters, because cancer is like a big fire. And these firefighters are the cancer drugs. But we're sending them out without a fire truck -- so without transportation, without ladders and without emergency equipment. And over 99 percent of these firefighters never make it to the fire. Over 99 percent of cancer drugs never make it to the tumor because they lack transportation and tools to take them to the location they're aiming for. Turns out, it really is all about location, location, location."", '02:31': '(Laughter)', '02:32': ""So we need a fire truck to get to the right location. And I'm here to tell you that nanoparticles are the fire trucks. We can load cancer drugs inside nanoparticles, and nanoparticles can function as the carrier and necessary equipment to bring the cancer drugs to the heart of the tumor."", '02:57': 'So what are nanoparticles, and what does it really mean to be nano-sized? Well, there are many different types of nanoparticles made out of various materials, such as metal-based nanoparticles or fat-based nanoparticles. But to really illustrate what it means to be nano-sized, I took one of my hair strands and placed it under the microscope. Now, I have very thin hair, so my hair is approximately 40,000 nanometers in diameter. So this means, if we take 400 of our nanoparticles and we stack them on top of each other, we get the thickness of a single hair strand.', '03:41': 'I lead a nanoparticle laboratory to fight cancer and other diseases at Mayo Clinic here in Jacksonville. And at Mayo Clinic, we really have the tools to make a difference for patients, thanks to the generous donations and grants to fund our research. And so, how do these nanoparticles manage to transport cancer drugs to the tumor? Well, they have an extensive toolbox.', '04:11': ""Cancer drugs without nanoparticles are quickly washed out of the body through the kidneys because they're so small. So it's like water going through a sieve. And so they don't really have time to reach the tumor. Here we see an illustration of this. We have the firefighters, the cancer drugs. They're circulating in the blood, but they're quickly washed out of the body and they don't really end up inside the tumor. But if we put these cancer drugs inside nanoparticles, they will not get washed out by the body because the nanoparticles are too big. And they will continue to circulate in the blood, giving them more time to find the tumor. And here we see the cancer drug, the firefighters, inside the fire truck, the nanoparticles. They're circulating in the blood, they don't get washed out and they actually end up reaching the tumor."", '05:08': 'And so what other tools do nanoparticles have? Well, they can protect cancer drugs from getting destroyed inside the body. There are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzymes in the blood. So unless they have this nanoparticle protection, they will not be able to function. Another nanoparticle tool are these surface extensions that are like tiny hands with fingers that grab on to the tumor and fit exactly onto it, so that when the nanoparticles are circulating, they can attach onto the cancer cells, buying the cancer drugs more time to do their job. And these are just some of the many tools that nanoparticles can have.', '05:56': ""And today, we have more than 10 clinically approved nanoparticles for cancer that are given to patients all over the world. Yet, we have patients, like Rebecca, who die. So what are the major challenges and limitations with currently approved nanoparticles? Well, a major challenge is the liver, because the liver is the body's filtration system, and the liver recognizes and destroys foreign objects, such as viruses, bacteria and also nanoparticles. And the immune cells in the liver eat the nanoparticles, preventing them from reaching the tumor. And here we see an illustration where the kidney is no longer a problem, but these fire trucks, the nanoparticles, get stuck in the liver and, actually, less of them end up reaching the tumor."", '06:56': ""So a future strategy to improve nanoparticles is to temporarily disarm the immune cells in the liver. So how do we disarm these cells? Well, we looked at drugs that were already clinically approved for other indications to see if any of them could stop the immune cells from eating the nanoparticles. And unexpectedly, in one of our preclinical studies, we found that a 70-year-old malaria drug was able to stop the immune cells from internalizing the nanoparticles so that they could escape the liver and continue their journey to their goal, the tumor. And here we see the illustration of blocking the liver. The nanoparticles don't go there, and they instead end up in the tumor. So, sometimes, unexpected connections are made in science that lead to new solutions."", '07:57': ""Another strategy for preventing nanoparticles from getting stuck in the liver is to use the body's own nanoparticles. Yes -- surprise, surprise. You, and you and you, and all of us have a lot of nanoparticles circulating in our bodies. And because they're part of our bodies, the liver is less likely to label them as foreign. And these biological nanoparticles can be found in the saliva, in the blood, in the urine, in pancreatic juice. And we can collect them from the body and use them as fire trucks for cancer drugs. And in this case, the immune cells in the liver are less likely to eat the biological nanoparticles. So we're using a Trojan-horse-based concept to fool the liver. And here we see the biological nanoparticles circulating in the blood. They don't get recognized by the liver, and they end up in the tumor. And in the future, we want to exploit nature's own nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery, to reduce side effects and save lives by preventing the cancer drugs from being in the wrong location."", '09:17': 'However, a major problem has been: How do we isolate these biological nanoparticles in large quantities without damaging them? My lab has developed an efficient method for doing this. We can process large quantities of liquids from the body to produce a highly concentrated, high-quality formulation of biological nanoparticles. And these nanoparticles are not yet in clinical use, because it takes an average of 12 years to get something from the lab to your medicine cabinet.', '09:57': 'And this is the type of challenge that requires teamwork from scientists and physicians, who dedicate their lives to this battle. And we keep going, thanks to inspiration from patients. And I believe that if we keep working on these nanomedicines, we will be able to reduce harm to healthy organs, improve quality of life and save future patients.', '10:29': 'I like to imagine that if these treatments had been available for Rebecca, that call from her could have been an invitation not to her funeral, but her wedding.', '10:44': 'Thank you.', '10:46': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is how the world's two billion poorest people cook and light their homes every day. This isn't just inconvenient, this is inefficient, it's expensive, it's harmful to human health, harmful to the environment, and it's unproductive. And that's energy poverty."", '00:30': ""So let me give you a couple of examples. I work in Haiti, where about 80% of the population lives in energy poverty. The average household spends 10% of its income on kerosene for lighting – that's an order of magnitude greater than what the average US household spends on electricity to light their homes. The 2008 hurricane season in Haiti caused about one billion dollars in damage. That was a sixth of their GDP. The damage was so severe because the primary energy fuel in Haiti is charcoal, which is made from trees, and has left the country almost completely deforested. Without trees, the country can't absorb heavy rains and massive flooding, as a result. So in the industrialized world, we built walls that protect us from the externalities of our energy use; we can afford to clean up acute environmental disasters; and we can also afford to adapt to chronic conditions like climate change. That's not the case for Haiti. They can't afford this. The only way they're going to lift themselves out of energy poverty is by adapting fuels that are more efficient, that are less expensive, that are better for human health, better for the environment and that are more productive."", '01:42': ""So it turns out that those fuels and technologies exist, and this is an example of that. This is a solar LED lightbulb that we sell for a retail price of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti. That's a payback period of less than three months for the average Haitian household. The prescriptions to solve energy poverty seems pretty straightforward: you develop these technologies that have a great return on investment, and people should be snatching them up. But that's not the case."", '02:12': ""The first time I ever went down to Haiti was in August of 2008, sort of on a whim, and I was fielding surveys in the rural south of the country to assess the extent of energy poverty. And at night, I would go around sometimes and I would speak with the street vendors and see if they were interested in buying these solar LED lamps. One woman who I encountered turned down my offer, and she said, “Mon chéri, c'est trop Cher,” which basically means, “My dear, it's too expensive.” But I tried to explain to her, “Look, this is going to save you a lot of money, and it's going to give you even better light than what you're using now with the kerosene.” So I didn't make the sale, but I did learn a really important lesson, which is that technology, products, were not going to end energy poverty. Instead, access was going to."", '02:57': ""Specifically, there are two types of access that are going to end energy poverty: there's physical access, and there's financial access. So, physical access -- what does that mean? It's very expensive for low-income households in developing countries to reach major centers of commerce. And it's basically impossible for them to order something off Amazon.com. “The last mile” is a phrase that's normally associated with the telecommunications industry. It means that last bit of wire that's necessary to connect the customer to the provider. What we need for ending energy poverty are last-mile retailers that bring these clean energy products to the people. The kerosene and charcoal value chains already figured this out: those fuels are ubiquitous across the entire country. You can go to the most remote village in Haiti and you will find somebody selling kerosene and charcoal."", '03:49': ""So the other type of access: financial. We all know that clean energy products, technologies, tend to be characterized by higher upfront costs, but very low operating costs. And so in the industrialized world, we have very generous subsidies that are specifically designed to bring down those upfront costs. Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti. What they do have is microfinance. But you're going to severely diminish the value proposition of your clean energy product if you expect somebody in Haiti to go out, get a microloan, go back to the retailer, and then buy the clean energy product."", '04:24': ""So the prescription to end energy poverty is much more complicated than simply products. We need to integrate financial access directly into new, innovative distribution models. What does that mean? That means bundling consumer credit with the retailer. This is really easy for Bloomingdale’s to do, but it's not so easy for a rural sales agent in Haiti to do. We need to redirect cash flows that are going now from the diaspora in the United States through Western Union wire transfers in cash directly into clean energy products that can be delivered to or picked up by their friends or family in Haiti."", '05:02': ""So the next time you hear about a technology or product that's going to change the world, be a little bit skeptical. The inventor Dean Kamen, the guy who invented the Segway, a genius by any standards, once said that his job is easy, inventing things is easy, the hard part is the technology dissemination -- it's getting those technologies and products to the people who need it most."", '05:26': 'Thank you.', '05:27': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time.', '00:19': 'What happens next?', '00:21': 'Before it can navigate this onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second.', '00:46': 'That’s a tall order, but there’s a solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe called LIDAR, and a miniature version of the communications technology that keeps the internet humming, called integrated photonics.', '01:01': 'To understand LIDAR, it helps to start with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, or depth, of these features?', '01:43': 'LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system quickly renders a detailed profile.', '02:14': 'The most obvious way to create a pulse of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically block the light reliably and rapidly.', '02:34': 'That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add up to become very large; in other places, they completely cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator does something similar. It splits waves of light along two parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super- sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with 20/20 vision, from across a street.', '03:58': 'The first generation of automobile LIDAR has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts and scan at rapid speeds.', '04:28': 'By slowing the light in a modulator arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel can be designed: a steerable laser beam.', '04:48': 'From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He prescribes a seven-step meditation exercise to extend compassion beyond our inner circle.",0:17:53,17.88333333,355275,2008-10-31T04:58:00+00:00,"['charter for compassion', 'compassion', 'global issues', 'love', 'religion', 'self']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Català', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Lietuvių kalba', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Slovenščina', 'Svenska', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'ภาษาไทย', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Robert Thurman,Buddhist scholar,"{'00:04': 'I want to open by quoting Einstein\'s wonderful statement, just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action. He said, ""A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the \'universe,\' -- a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.""', '00:54': 'This insight of Einstein\'s is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology, wherein compassion -- ""karuna,"" it is called -- is defined as, ""the sensitivity to another\'s suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."" It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others, and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free and, implicitly, more happy.', '01:40': ""The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others, even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous, his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up, as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus, he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say."", '02:33': ""Now, I want to tell a story, which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition, of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time."", '02:54': 'And so he said, ""I\'m sick of all this. Nobody\'s really living the doctrine. They\'re talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment, but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So, Buddha\'s teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now, but exists currently in a certain heaven"" -- that\'s Maitreya -- ""so, I\'m going to go on a retreat and I\'m going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me, and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.""', '03:27': 'So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving, he saw a man -- a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said, ""Well what are you doing?"" And the man said, ""I\'m making a needle."" And he said, ""That\'s ridiculous. You can\'t make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."" And the man said, ""Really?"" And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said, ""Okay, I get the point."" He went back to his cave. He meditated again.', '04:07': 'Another three years, no vision. He leaves again. This time, he comes down. And as he\'s leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it\'s landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said, ""All right. I get the point."" He went back.', '04:32': ""Another three years. Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping, making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision."", '04:51': 'And he comes to the town. He\'s a broken person. And there, in the town, he\'s approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he\'s looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it\'s so pathetic, and it\'s trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog\'s whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous, and there are maggots in the flesh. And it\'s terrible. He thinks, ""What can I do to fix up this dog? Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it.""', '05:28': 'So, he takes it to some water. He\'s about to clean, but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they\'re maggoting happily in the dog\'s hindquarters there. ""Well, if I clean the dog, I\'ll kill the maggots. So how can that be? That\'s it. I\'m a useless person and there\'s no Buddha, no Maitreya, and everything is all hopeless. And now I\'m going to kill the maggots?""', '05:52': 'So, he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh, and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought, ""I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh, then clean the dog\'s wounds, and then I\'ll figure out what to do with the maggots.""', '06:16': 'So he starts to do that. He can\'t grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They\'re kind of hard to grab, these maggots. So he says, ""Well, I\'ll put my tongue on the dog\'s flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue"" -- the dog is kind of used up -- ""and then I\'ll spit them one by one down on the thing."" So he goes down, and he\'s sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes, it\'s so disgusting, and the smell and everything.', '06:41': 'And then, suddenly, there\'s a pfft, a noise like that. He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body, an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees. And he says, ""Oh."" He bows. But, being human, he\'s immediately thinking of his next complaint.', '07:02': 'So as he comes up from his first bow he says, ""My Lord, I\'m so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years? What is this?""', '07:10': 'And Maitreya says, ""I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"" (Laughter) ""Looking for the Buddha in person,"" he said. And he said, ""You didn\'t have, until this moment, real compassion. And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."" ""Maitreya"" means love, ""the loving one,"" in Sanskrit.', '07:35': 'And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did. And he said, ""If you don\'t believe me, just take me with you."" And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball -- took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, ""Rejoice! Rejoice! The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."" And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him -- it wasn\'t Chautauqua, it was some other town -- because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man, like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder, shouting that the future Buddha had come.', '08:12': 'So, naturally, they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground, saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog, but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.', '08:30': 'Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven, which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years, dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.', '08:44': 'And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them. A famous one, it\'s called the ""Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."" And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one -- even animals too, but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say, ""Well, the loved ones I love. But, you know, after all, they\'re nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So, in a way, I like them so much because they\'re nice to me. While the neutral ones I don\'t know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don\'t like because they\'re mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.""', '09:40': 'And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we\'ve all had infinite previous lives, we\'ve all been each other\'s relatives, actually. Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view, in some previous life, although you don\'t remember it and neither do I, have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also, actually, I\'ve been your mother. I\'ve been female, and I\'ve been every single one of yours\' mother in a previous life, the way the Buddhists reflect. So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression; ""the eternal mama,"" you said. That\'s wonderful. So, that\'s the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God\'s children. So, in that sense, we\'re related.', '10:26': 'So, they first create this foundation of equality. So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don\'t know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the ""I don\'t want to be compassionate to them"" to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don\'t like. And we don\'t hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That\'s very important.', '10:49': 'And then the next thing we do is what is called ""mother recognition."" And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama, and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face, looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal, where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that\'s why it\'s the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings, in spiritual traditions. And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.', '11:41': ""People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom, when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem, but you think of him as a mom."", '12:08': 'And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you, and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while, until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They\'re not ""other."" You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general, if you can remember the kindness of your own mother, if you can remember the kindness of your spouse, or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.', '12:54': 'And then, third, you step from there to what is called ""a feeling of gratitude."" You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step, you go to what is called ""lovely love."" In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy, when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn\'t look like this. When they\'re angry, they look ugly, every being, but when they\'re happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.', '13:35': 'We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says, ""Love thine enemy."" He does say that, and we think he\'s being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. ""Nice for him to say it, but I can\'t do that."" But, actually, that\'s practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy? How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy, because they\'ll stop being your enemy because that\'s too much trouble.', '14:06': 'But anyway, that\'s the ""lovely love. "" And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, ""universal compassion."" And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them, and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don\'t even have compassion on themselves. They\'re driven by this duty and this obligation. ""I have to get that. I need more. I\'m not worthy. And I should do something."" And they\'re rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they, then, never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have, the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them.', '14:55': ""And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action, of course, hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him, he wanted to help. But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know."", '15:26': 'And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond ""universal compassion"" -- is this thing where you\'re linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn\'t sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they\'re punished by God or whatever. And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing, by dying, but they don\'t. And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.', '16:02': 'Never mind. I won\'t get into that. But the next step is called ""universal responsibility."" And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion, what is called ""universal responsibility."" In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere, he says that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness. But ""kindness"" means ""universal responsibility."" And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.', '16:42': ""And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself, even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings: they can sense this new quality in yourself, and it helps them already, and gives them an example."", '17:17': ""And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over."", '17:21': 'So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don\'t just think, ""Well, I\'m compassionate,"" or ""I\'m not compassionate,"" and sort of think you\'re stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion, the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others, and take universal responsibility for them. And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile, but Karen Armstrong will smile.', '17:49': 'Thank you very much.

The short answer is that no one wants to watch a starship crew spend years compiling an alien dictionary. But to keep things consistent, the creators of Star Trek and other science-fiction worlds have introduced the concept of a universal translator, a portable device that can instantly translate between any languages. So is a universal translator possible in real life? We already have many programs that claim to do just that, taking a word, sentence, or entire book in one language and translating it into almost any other, whether it\'s modern English or Ancient Sanskrit. And if translation were just a matter of looking up words in a dictionary, these programs would run circles around humans. The reality, however, is a bit more complicated. A rule-based translation program uses a lexical database, which includes all the words you\'d find in a dictionary and all grammatical forms they can take, and set of rules to recognize the basic linguistic elements in the input language. For a seemingly simple sentence like, ""The children eat the muffins,"" the program first parses its syntax, or grammatical structure, by identifying the children as the subject, and the rest of the sentence as the predicate consisting of a verb ""eat,"" and a direct object ""the muffins."" It then needs to recognize English morphology, or how the language can be broken down into its smallest meaningful units, such as the word muffin and the suffix ""s,"" used to indicate plural. Finally, it needs to understand the semantics, what the different parts of the sentence actually mean. To translate this sentence properly, the program would refer to a different set of vocabulary and rules for each element of the target language. But this is where it gets tricky. The syntax of some languages allows words to be arranged in any order, while in others, doing so could make the muffin eat the child. Morphology can also pose a problem. Slovene distinguishes between two children and three or more using a dual suffix absent in many other languages, while Russian\'s lack of definite articles might leave you wondering whether the children are eating some particular muffins, or just eat muffins in general. Finally, even when the semantics are technically correct, the program might miss their finer points, such as whether the children ""mangiano"" the muffins, or ""divorano"" them. Another method is statistical machine translation, which analyzes a database of books, articles, and documents that have already been translated by humans. By finding matches between source and translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance, the program can identify corresponding phrases and patterns, and use them for future translations. However, the quality of this type of translation depends on the size of the initial database and the availability of samples for certain languages or styles of writing. The difficulty that computers have with the exceptions, irregularities and shades of meaning that seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe that our understanding of language is a unique product of our biological brain structure. In fact, one of the most famous fictional universal translators, the Babel fish from ""The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy"", is not a machine at all but a small creature that translates the brain waves and nerve signals of sentient species through a form of telepathy. For now, learning a language the old fashioned way will still give you better results than any currently available computer program. But this is no easy task, and the sheer number of languages in the world, as well as the increasing interaction between the people who speak them, will only continue to spur greater advances in automatic translation. Perhaps by the time we encounter intergalactic life forms, we\'ll be able to communicate with them through a tiny gizmo, or we might have to start compiling that dictionary, after all.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this fascinating history of typography, designer Douglas Thomas shares Futura's role in launching the Apollo 11 spacecraft -- and how it became one of the most used fonts in the world.",0:14:18,14.3,354402,2019-07-19T14:52:48+00:00,"['design', 'typography', 'space', 'humanity', 'history', 'Moon', 'solar system', 'TEDx']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'हिन्दी', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Douglas Thomas,"Designer, writer and historian of typography","{'00:05': 'In 1969 in July, three Americans launched into space. Now, they went to the surface of the moon, they famously made the great leap for mankind. Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, they walked on the surface, they planted this flag. It\'s rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph. We think it was this amazing accomplishment. They didn\'t just leave behind this flag, though. They also left behind a plaque. This plaque is a beautiful object, and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about. First, you might notice that there\'s two globes, representing all of earth. And then there\'s this beautiful statement: ""We came in peace for all mankind."" Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language, but it\'s also set in a typeface that\'s perfect for this moment. It seems industrial, it seems engineered. It also is the best possible name you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.', '01:00': ""Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, and why this typeface is perfect for this moment. But it's actually more than just ceremonial. Now, when all of you arrived here today, you actually had to think about fonts. You might not realize it, but you're all unconscious experts on typography. Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world, they're the visual language of the words we use. Here's the thing that's funny about this, though. I know you're probably not like me, you're not a font nerd, maybe some of you are, but if you're not, that's alright, because I might spend hours every day trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project, or I might spend thousands of dollars every year, trying to get ones with the right features. But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts. If you don't believe me, think about how you got here. Each of you had to judge by the signs and maybe even on your phone, which signals to trust and which to ignore. You were evaluating fonts."", '01:57': ""Or maybe when you're just buying a new product, you have to think about whether something is expensive or cheap or hard to get or easy to find. And the funny thing about it is, this may not seem extraordinary to you, but the moment you see something out of place, you recognize it right away."", '02:13': '(Laughter)', '02:15': 'The thing I love about typography, and why I love fonts and why I love Futura, is that, for me, what I study is everywhere. Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up, every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love. Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography, you actually have a history of everything before you.', '02:39': 'And this is the typeface Futura. As previously we\'ve discussed, this is modernism in miniature. This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface, of the twentieth century. ""Less is more,"" right, these are the aphorisms of modernism. And in the visual arts, the same thing happened. Let\'s focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes, focus on geometry. So Futura actually holds this to its core. You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura have circles, squares, triangles. Some of the shapes are all based on circles, like the O, D and C, or others have this pointed apex of the triangle. Others just look like they might have been made with a ruler or a compass. They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise. In fact, this whole system carries through with the way that the typeface was designed. To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new. Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight. The whole family has different things to commend to it.', '03:37': ""This was a conscious break from the past, something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand. When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean. This is what we think about maybe, when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen. That there's thicks and thins. And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond, holds vestiges of this old system in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top and thicker down below, because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand. But Futura, in contrast, is designed to look like no one had touched it at all, that this was made by a machine, for a machine age, for an industrial age."", '04:11': ""There's actually a sleight of hand here that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed. If you look at the way in which the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft, you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly. And this is one of hundreds of ways in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect, even though it's mathematically not. And this is what typeface designers do all the time to make typefaces work, every day."", '04:37': ""Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America. These are a few other excellent examples from Europe, trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time. These are some other ones in Germany that in some ways look very similar to Futura, maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions. Then why did Futura take over the world? In this case, if you can read the titles there, some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue: Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk. These aren't exactly household names, are they? And so when you compare that to Futura, you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team."", '05:15': ""What's amazing about this name -- you know, what's in this name is that this is a name that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future. And this isn't actually the word for future in German, it wasn't a German name, they actually picked something that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience. And when you compare it to what was being done in America -- these are the typefaces from the same period in the United States in the 1920s, bold, brash, braggadocios. You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like when they were all going nuts in the 1920s. And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary."", '05:48': 'I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use. So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, ""Vanity Fair."" This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer. And in many ways, there\'s nothing wrong with this design. This is absolutely typical of the 1920s. There\'s a photograph of an important person, in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York. Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical. There\'s still a little bit of ornamentation, so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady and not fully modernistic. But everything seems kid of solid. There\'s even drop caps to help you get into the text.', '06:23': 'But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929, a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned ""Vanity Fair."" And this is what it looks like with Futura. Instead of the governor now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting, in this case, the ocean. Instead of drop caps, there\'s nothing at all. And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry. And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine. In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry. In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page and breaking the gutter of the two pages. And there\'s something even more radical. If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something. You might not pick it up at first, but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page. You might not think that\'s very radical, but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website, and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily. This is still a radical idea.', '07:17': ""And why is that radical? When we think about what capital letters denote, they denote something important, whether it's our names, or our titles. Or maybe even just the name of our corporations, or maybe our trademarks. Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization. We love putting capitals in everything."", '07:35': '(Laughter)', '07:37': ""But think about how radical this would be to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters. This has maybe had the same political force that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today. In the 1920s, this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution. And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America. All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian, complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field. Now this is still kind of a radical idea. Think about how often you do capitalize something to have more power or prestige to it. So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea."", '08:19': 'Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura. Others brought other ideas of modernism with it, whether it was interesting new illustration styles, or interesting new collage types of illustration. Or even just new book covers, whether they were from Europe.', '08:34': ""But here's the funny thing. In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface, you couldn't just go download it onto your computer. You actually had to have pieces of lead. So for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system, something they could use in everyday typography, whether in ads or anything else, they actually had to have metal type."", '08:54': 'So being good American capitalists, what did we do? We made all sorts of copies. Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura, but looked identical to it, whether it was Spartan or Tempo. And in fact, by the time that World War II started, American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods. But they said, ""Go ahead and use our copies. Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo. These are identical to Futura."" And in fact, for most people, they didn\'t even learn the new names, they just still called it all Futura. So America took this typeface in, conquered it and made it its own. So by the time World War II finishes, Americans are using this on everything, whether it be catalogs, or atlases, or encyclopedias or charts and graphs, or calendars, or even political material. And even the logo for a new expansion football team. And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertising of the 20th century.', '09:50': ""So it's in this context that when the US government was picking a typeface to use after World War II for new maps and new projects, they picked Futura. It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice, it didn't have anything to do with communism. But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps, so this one, an air force map in 1962, or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66."", '10:11': ""And so it wasn't a surprise that when astronauts first started the Mercury program, such as John Glenn orbiting the earth, that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura. And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo, it started getting used more and more for more things. So in this case for a safety plan, or even starting to get used on instrument panels, or navigational aids. Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked."", '10:37': ""But here's the amazing thing, it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people. It started to get used for an interface, for an entire system that helped the astronauts know how to use the machine. NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything. There was hundreds of contractors -- Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas -- all making different machines. Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems for each component they had in the space shuttles. This would have been impossible to navigate and there would have been a cognitive overload every time they had to open up a new system. So in this case, Futura being used on the interface helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear. And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels, and it was used on their food rations, and it was used on their tool kits. It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do. In fact, maybe even some of the places where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them, instructions were printed entirely in Futura, so that they could know what to do with that one moment. They didn't have to remember everything in their head, they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to. In this case, Futura helped make that system, which was already a very difficult and complex system, a little less complex. In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen when they were entering or exiting the spacecraft would have been in Futura."", '11:58': ""One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way is actually this camera. This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company. It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one, it's prized by photographers as a really great camera. And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras, that there's some modifications made to it. In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters, or other parts of the camera here. What this enabled NASA to do, was make something really great out of the astronauts. They're not photographers, they're not experts in art. But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camera because of the labels placed there in Futura."", '12:38': 'So in this case, Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy with the things they were using. In this case to not take off the film before it would expose. Which, in this case, we would have never had some of the amazing photos we had without this label. When we see something as decorative as this, a ceremonial patch, or something like this plaque on the moon, we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial, something more than something that had just been picked for its design. In fact, Futura had authority, had legitimacy and had power because of this choice.', '13:13': ""There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing. And that is that Futura tells a story. And this is what I love about typefaces, is that all of them tell stories. And in this case, this typeface tells a very powerful story about assimilation, about something being taken into America and being made part of its culture. And that's one of the best and worst things America does, is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back again and claim them our own. And in this case, Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technology undergirding the whole system. Futura was a German typeface, taken in, made into an American commodity. And so were the technologies: the rockets, the scientists all came from Germany as well. So in some ways, this German typeface on an American plaque perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology. And in this case, when you think about this story, you realize that typography on the moon represents legitimacy, represents authority, and this gave them, the astronauts, the power to get to the moon."", '14:13': 'Thank you.', '14:15': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a talk about the future of space exploration, Lynn Rothschild reviews the immense challenges to living elsewhere in the universe and proposes some bold, creative solutions to making a home off planet Earth -- like ""growing"" houses out of fungi or using bacteria to help generate electricity.",0:16:12,16.2,354364,2019-06-20T14:57:12+00:00,"['universe', 'space', 'future', 'technology', 'NASA', 'astronomy', 'Mars', 'solar system', 'exploration', 'science', 'life', 'biology']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', 'العربية', '中文 (繁體)']",Lynn Rothschild,"Astrobiologist, synthetic biologist","{'00:09': ""For thousands of years, well, really probably millions of years, our ancestors have looked up at the sky and wondered what's up there, and they've also started to wonder, hmm, could we be alone in this planet? Now, I'm fortunate that I get to get paid to actually ask some of those questions, and sort of bad news for you, your tax dollars are paying me to try to answer some of those questions. But then, about 10 years ago, I was told, I mean asked, if I would start to look at the technology to help get us off planet, and so that's what I'm going to talk to you about today."", '00:47': ""So playing to the local crowd, this is what it looks like in your day-to-day life in Boston, but as you start to go off planet, things look very, very different. So there we are, hovering above the WGBH studios. And here's a very famous picture of the Earthrise from the Moon, and you can see the Earth starting to recede. And then what I love is this picture that was taken from the surface of Mars looking back at the Earth. Can anyone find the Earth? I'm going to help you out a little."", '01:21': '(Laughter)', '01:23': ""Yeah. The point of showing this is that when people start to go to Mars, they're not going to be able to keep calling in and be micromanaged the way people on a space station are. They're going to have to be independent. So even though they're up there, there are going to be all sorts of things that they're going to need, just like people on Earth need things like, oh, transportation, life support, food, clothing and so on. But unlike on Earth, they are also going to need oxygen. They're going to have to deal with about a third of the gravity that we have here. They're going to have to worry about habitats, power, heat, light and radiation protection, something that we don't actually worry about nearly as much on the Earth, because we have this beautiful atmosphere and magnetosphere."", '02:06': 'The problem with that is that we also have a lot of constraints. So the biggest one for us is upmass, and the number that I\'ve used for years is it costs about 10,000 dollars to launch a can of Coke into low Earth orbit. The problem is, there you are with 10,000 dollars later, and you\'re still in low Earth orbit. You\'re not even at the Moon or Mars or anything else. So you\'re going to have to try to figure out how to keep the mass as low as possible so you don\'t have to launch it. But on top of that cost issue with the mass, you also have problems of storage and flexibility and reliability. You can\'t just get there and say, ""Oops, I forgot to bring,"" because Amazon.com just does not deliver to Mars. So you better be prepared.', '02:58': ""So what is the solution for this? And I'm going to propose to you for the rest of this talk that the solution actually is life, and when you start to look at life as a technology, you realize, ah, that's it, that's exactly what we needed. This plant here, like every person here and every one of your dogs and cats and plants and so on, all started as a single cell. So imagine, you're starting as a very low upmass object and then growing into something a good deal bigger."", '03:31': ""Now, my hero Charles Darwin, of course, reminds us that there's no such thing as a designer in biology, but what if we now have the technology to design biology, maybe even design, oh, whole new life-forms that can do things for us that we couldn't have imagined otherwise?"", '03:54': 'So years ago, I was asked to start to sell this program, and while I was doing that, I was put in front of a panel at NASA, as you might sort of imagine, a bunch of people in suits and white shirts and pencil protectors, and I did this sort of crazy, wild, ""This is all the next great thing,"" and I thought they would be blown over, and instead the chairman of the committee just looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""So what\'s the big idea?"" So I was like, ""OK, you want Star Trek? We\'ll do Star Trek."" And so let me tell you what the big idea is. We\'ve used organisms to make biomaterials for years. So here\'s a great picture taken outside of Glasgow, and you can see lots of great biomaterials there. There are trees that you could use to build houses. There are sheep where you can get your wool from. You could get leather from the sheep. Just quickly glancing around the room, I\'ll bet there\'s no one in this room that doesn\'t have some kind of animal or plant product on them, some kind of biomaterial.', '04:57': ""But you know what? We're not going to take sheep and trees and stuff to Mars. That's nuts, because of the upmass problem. But we are going to take things like this. This is Bacillus subtilis. Those white dots that you see are spores. This happens to be a bacterium that can form incredibly resistant spores, and when I say incredibly resistant, they've proven themselves. Bacillus subtilis spores have been flown on what was called LDEF, Long Duration Exposure Facility, for almost six years and some of them survived that in space. Unbelievable, a lot better than any of us can do. So why not just take the capabilities, like to make wood or to make wool or spider silk or whatever, and put them in Bacillus subtilis spores, and take those with you off planet?"", '05:45': ""So what are you going to do when you're off planet? Here's an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin looking back at the Eagle when he landed, oh, it was almost 50 years ago, on the surface of the Moon. Now if you're going to go to the Moon for three days and you're the first person to set foot, yeah, you can live in a tin can, but you wouldn't want to do that for, say, a year and a half. So I did actually a calculation, being in California. I looked at what the average size of a cell at Alcatraz is, and I have news for you, the volume in the Eagle there, in the Lunar Module, was about the size of a cell at Alcatraz if it were only five feet high. So incredibly cramped living quarters. You just can't ask a human to stay in there for long periods of time."", '06:32': ""So why not take these biomaterials and make something? So here's an image that a colleague of mine who is an architect, Chris Maurer, has done of what we've been proposing, and we'll get to the point of why I've been standing up here holding something that looks like a dried sandwich this whole lecture."", '06:50': ""So we've proposed that the solution to the habitat problem on Mars could just simply lie in a fungus."", '06:59': ""So I'm now probably going to turn off everyone from ever eating a mushroom again. So let's talk about fungi for a second."", '07:06': ""So you're probably familiar with this fruiting body of the fungus. That's the mushroom. But what we're interested in actually is what's beneath the surface there, the mycelium, which are these root hair-like structures that are really the main part of the mushroom. Well, it turns out you can take those -- there's a micrograph I did -- and you can put them in a mold and give them a little food -- and it doesn't take much, you can grow these things on sawdust -- so this piece here was grown on sawdust, and that mycelium then will fill that structure to make something. We've actually tried growing mycelium on Mars Simulant. So no one's actually gone to the surface of Mars, but this is a simulated surface of Mars, and you can see those hair-like mycelia out there. It's really amazing stuff. How strong can you make these things? Well, you know, I could give you numbers and tests and so on, but I think that's probably the best way to describe it. There's one of my students proving that you can do this. To do this, then, you've got to figure out how to put it in context."", '08:08': ""How's this actually going to happen? I mean, this is a great idea, Lynn, but how are you going to get from here to there? So what we're saying is you grow up the mycelium in the lab, for example and then you fill up a little structure, maybe a house-like structure that's tiny, that is maybe a double-bagged sort of plastic thing, like an inflatable -- I sort of think L.L.Bean when I see this. And then you put it in a rocket ship and you send it off to Mars. Rocket lands, you release the bag and you add a little water, and voila, you've got your habitat. You know, how cool would that be? And the beauty of that is you don't have to take something prebuilt. And so our estimates are that we could save 90 percent of the mass that NASA is currently proposing by taking up a big steel structure if we actually grow it on site."", '09:01': 'So let me give you another big idea. What about digital information? What\'s really interesting is you have a physical link to your parents and they have a physical link to their parents, and so on, all the way back to the origin of life. You have never broken that continuum. But the fact is that we can do that today. So we have students every day in our labs -- students in Boston even do this -- that make up DNA sequences and they hit the ""send"" button and they send them to their local DNA synthesis company.', '09:33': ""Now once you break that physical link where you're sending it across town, it doesn't matter if you're sending it across the Charles River or if you're sending that information to Mars. You've broken that physical link. So then, once you're on Mars, or across the river or wherever, you can take that digital information, synthesize the physical DNA, put it maybe in another organism and voila, you've got new capabilities there. So again, you've broken that physical link. That's huge."", '10:01': 'What about chemistry? Biology does chemistry for us on Earth, and again has for literally thousands of years. I bet virtually everyone in this room has eaten something today that has been made by biology doing chemistry. Let me give you a big hint there.', '10:16': ""What about another idea? What about using DNA itself to make a wire? Because again, we're trying to miniaturize everything. DNA is really cheap. Strawberries have a gazillion amount of DNA. You know, you could take a strawberry with you, isolate the DNA, and one of my students has figured out a way to take DNA and tweak it a little bit so that you can incorporate silver atoms in very specific places, thus making an electrical wire. How cool is that?"", '10:46': ""So while we're on the subject of metals, we're going to need to use metals for things like integrated circuits. Probably we're going to want it for some structures, and so on. And things like integrated circuits ultimately go bad. We could talk a lot about that, but I'm going to leave it at that, that they do go bad, and so where are you going to get those metals? Yeah, you could try to mine them with heavy equipment, but you get that upmass problem. And I always tell people, the best way to find the metals for a new cell phone is in a dead cell phone. So what if you take biology as the technology to get these metals out? And how do you do this? Well, take a look at the back of a vitamin bottle and you'll get an idea of all the sorts of metals that we actually use in our bodies. So we have a lot of proteins as well as other organisms that can actually specifically bind metals. So what if we now take those proteins and maybe attach them to this fungal mycelium and make a filter so we can start to pull those metals out in a very specific way without big mining equipment, and, even better, we've actually got a proof of concept where we've then taken those metals that we pulled out with proteins and reprinted an integrated circuit using a plasma printer. Again, how cool?"", '12:07': ""Electricity: I was asked by a head of one of the NASA centers if you could ever take chemical energy and turn that into electrical energy. Well, the great news is it's not just the electric eel that does it. Everybody in this room who is still alive and functioning is doing that. Part of the food that you've eaten today has gone to operate the nerve cells in your body. But even other organisms, nonsentient ones, are creating electric energy, even bacteria. Some bacteria are very good at making little wires. So if we can harvest that ability of turning chemical energy into electrical energy, again, how cool would that be?"", '12:46': ""So here are some of the big ideas we talked about. Let me try one more: life 2.0. So for example, all of the sugars in our body are right-handed. Why shouldn't we make an organism with left-handed sugars? Why not make an organism that can do things that no organism can do today? So organisms normally have evolved to live in very specific environments. So here's this lion cub literally up a tree, and I took a picture of him a bit later, and he was a lot happier when he was down on the ground. So organisms are designed for specific environments. But what if you can go back to that idea of synthetic biology and tweak 'em around?"", '13:25': 'So here is one of our favorite places in Yellowstone National Park. This is Octopus Springs. If you tilt your head a little bit, it sort of looks like a body and tentacles coming out. It\'s above the boiling temperature of water. Those organisms that you see on the edge and the colors actually match the temperatures that are there, very, very high-temperature thermophiles. So why not take organisms that can live at extremes, whether it\'s high temperature or low temperature or low pH or high pH or high salt or high levels of radiation, and take some of those capabilities and put it into other organisms. And this is a project that my students have called, and I love this, the ""hell cell."" And so we\'ve done that. We\'ve taken organisms and sort of tweaked them and pushed them to the edges. And this is important for getting us off planet and also for understanding what life is like in the universe.', '14:15': ""So let me give you just a couple of final thoughts. First is this whole idea that we have all these needs for human settlement off planet that are in some ways exactly like we have on the Earth, that we need the food and we need the shelter and so on, but we have very, very different constraints of this upmass problem and the reliability and the flexibility and so on. But because we have these constraints that you don't have here, where you might have to think about the indigenous petrochemical industry, or whatever, you now have constraints that have to unleash creativity. And once you unleash this creativity because you have the new constraints, you're forcing game-changing technological advances that you wouldn't have gotten any other way."", '15:04': ""Finally, we have to think a little bit, is it a good idea to tinker around with life? Well, the sort of easy answer to that is that probably no one in the room keeps a wolf cub at home, but you might have a puppy or a dog; you probably didn't eat teosinte this summer, but you ate corn. We have been doing genetic modification with organisms for literally 10,000 or more years. This is a different approach, but to say all of a sudden humans should never touch an organism is kinda silly because we have that capability now to do things that are far more beneficial for the planet Earth and for life beyond that."", '15:50': ""And so then the question is, should we? And of course I feel that not only should we, at least for getting off Earth, but actually if we don't use synthetic biology, we will never solve this upmass problem. So once you think of life as a technology, you've got the solution."", '16:07': 'And so, with that, I\'d like to finish the way I always finish, and say ""ad astra,"" which means, ""to the stars.""', '16:13': 'Thank you very much, Boston.', '16:14': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning."", '01:18': 'Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq, finally, violence is on the rise again, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections.', '03:29': 'But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past? Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001, with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed. Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades.', '04:48': 'The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000. This is a decrease by two-thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war, from hunger or disease, for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. To put it differently, for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war, there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus, even though every civilian killed, maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many, the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago, is good news.', '06:22': 'So, we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question, of course, is why? In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this, but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success -- Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa, a colleague of mine once put it this way, ""The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.""', '07:30': ""But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity, decades of violence and thousands of people killed, 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially, for the long-term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland, he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them, a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments, who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland."", '08:36': ""The core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex, but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly, local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise, not always fast and not always enthusiastically, but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister?"", '09:47': ""But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example, or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries? By no means. The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership, diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full-scale civil war in Macedonia in 2001, or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005. In all three cases, local leaders were willing and able to make peace, the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement, and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed."", '10:42': 'Focusing on leadership, diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace, or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather, local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.', '11:23': ""The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged, and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership, more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues, the ongoing conflict in Darfur, escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country."", '12:08': ""A final example: Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence, tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many, many different factors. Central among them are three. First, the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second, an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third, a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level, well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint, explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008."", '13:20': 'So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal, local leaders and international leaders have a choice, and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace, but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli/Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland, or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia? Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First, leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters, their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future.', '14:45': 'Second, diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement.', '15:11': ""Third, institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues, innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls."", '15:51': 'For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore, we must invest in developing leaders, leaders that have the skills, vision and determination to make peace. Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices.', '16:42': ""A final thought: Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers, frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish, but it also requires us, today's generation, to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership, diplomacy and institutional design, so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow."", '17:13': 'Thank you.', '17:15': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m sure you\'ve heard the word. ""Darling, just adjust a bit. Just adjust. No matter what happens, just adjust."" ""Adjust"" trains girls to be powerless, not to exist, not to be seen, not to have a self, and it trains boys to claim power and authority over the world. And in the meantime we keep talking about gender equality and women\'s empowerment.', '01:42': 'After 2012, after the gang rape in a moving bus in Delhi, I really wanted to understand the roots of abuse. So I started asking a very simple question: what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today? And I was so surprised by what I heard, the answers particularly that young people gave, that the project became a research project and it took over my life.', '02:14': 'For three years, I listened to over 600 women, men and children, educated, middle class, and it led to 1,800 hours of listening and 8,000 pages of notes, and it took another year to make sense of it.', '02:30': 'Nowadays, we see well-dressed, educated women like many of you in this room, all of you in this room, and myself, and we think the world has changed, but these external changes are extremely misleading, because on the inside, we have not changed.', '02:50': ""So today, I'm not going to talk about poor people. I'm going to talk only about the middle and upper classes, because we are the ones most in denial. We are the ones who have said over and over again that when women are educated, when they're employed and they earn incomes, they will be equal, empowered and free. They're not. Why?"", '03:15': ""From my research, I identify seven habits that delete women, that make women disappear, but these habits persist because they're so familiar to us and we've made them good and moral. Why would you change or drop anything that's good and moral? So, on the one hand, we love our children, we love our daughters, and on the other hand, we crush them."", '03:43': 'Habit one: You don\'t have a body. The first step to make a girl a ghost is to make her body disappear, to pretend that she doesn\'t have a body. Akangsha, who is 23, said, ""In my family, we never spoke about the body, never."" And it is in this silence that millions and millions of girls get sexually molested, and they don\'t even tell their mothers. And it\'s the negative comments from others that leads to 90 percent of women saying that they dislike their bodies. When a girl rejects her body, she rejects her only house and invisibility and insecurity become her very shaky foundation.', '04:29': 'Habit two: Be quiet. Chup. If you\'re not supposed to exist and you don\'t have a body, how can you have a voice? So just about every woman said, ""When I was little, my mother used to scold me and say, \'Don\'t speak, be quiet, be chup, speak softly, don\'t argue and never answer back. Jawab nahi Dena.\'"" I\'m sure you\'ve all heard that. And so girls become afraid, and they withdraw. And they become quiet and they say, ""Let it go. Jaane do. What\'s the point? Nobody listens."" Educated women said that their number one problem was their inability to speak up, as if there was a foot on their throat ready to choke them. Silence slices off women.', '05:23': 'Habit three: Be a people pleaser. Please others. Everyone likes a nice woman who always smiles, who never says no, who is never angry, even when she\'s being exploited. Amisha, who is 18, said, ""My father said, \'If I don\'t see you smiling, I don\'t feel good.\'"" So she smiles. So her father is teaching her, my happiness is more important than your happiness. And in this business of trying to make everyone happy all the time, girls become afraid to make decisions. And when you ask them, they say, ""Anything, whatever! Kuch bhi! Everything goes. Chalta hai."" Darsha, who is 25, said with great pride, ""I\'m highly elastic. I become whatever others want me to be."" Such girls give up their dreams, their desires, and nobody even notices, except for depression. It moves in. Another slice of a girl is taken off.', '06:35': ""Habit four: You have no sexuality. I think you'd all agree that with a population of over 1.3 billion, sex is not new to India. What is new is that more people now acknowledge that women, too, have a right to sexual desire. But how can a woman who has not been allowed to own her body, who hasn't been educated about her body, who may have been sexually molested, who cannot say no and who has been filled with shame, how can she claim her sexual desire? A woman's sexuality is suppressed."", '07:15': 'Habit five: Don\'t trust women. Imagine how the world would change if women came together in solidarity, but as to make sure that this doesn\'t happen, our culture places high moral value on loyalty to men and family secrecy. Woman after woman said, ""I know only one trustworthy woman, and that\'s me."" Even Ruchi, who is 30 and who works on women\'s empowerment at Delhi University, said, ""I don\'t trust women. They\'re jealous and they backbite."" Obviously, then, in cities, women don\'t join women\'s groups, and when you ask them why, they say, ""We don\'t have time for gossip."" It\'s much easier to demolish a woman who is alone.', '08:02': 'Habit six: Duty over desire. Muskan gave a very long definition of a good girl, and she\'s only 15. ""She is kind, gentle, polite, loving, caring, truthful, obedient, respects elders, helps everyone unconditionally, and is good to others and fulfills duty."" Tiring, isn\'t it. By the time you fulfill duty, whatever little desire is left is also lost. And when sacrificing mothers have nothing left to say except talk about food -- ""Have you eaten? Khana kha liya? What will you eat?"" -- men like Saurabh, who is 24, call them ""boring."" A woman becomes a residue.', '08:47': 'Habit seven: Be totally dependent. So all these habits collectively crush women, fill her with fear and make her totally dependent on men for her survival, and this allows the system of male power to continue.', '09:04': 'So all these seven habits that we thought were good and moral snatch life away from girls and position men to abuse.', '09:15': ""We must change. How do we change? A habit is just a habit. Every habit is a learned habit, so we can unlearn them and this personal change is extremely important. I had to change too. But this doesn't change the system that crushes millions of other women. So we have to go to the roots. We must change what it means to be a good woman and a good man, because this a foundation of every society. We don't need elastic women, we need elastic definitions, for men too, and this big societal change cannot happen without men's involvement. We need you. We need men to become champions of change, to develop strong change muscles. Otherwise, it will be two more centuries before our girls, and our boys, are safe and free."", '10:12': ""Imagine half a billion women coming together, with the support of men, to talk to one another for conversation, for change, both personal and political, and imagine men in their own circles, and imagine women and men coming together to just listen to each other without judgment, without blame, without accusations and without shame. Imagine how much we would change. We can do this together. Women, don't adjust. Men, adjust. It's time."", '10:48': 'Thank you.', '10:49': '(Applause)', '10:54': 'SRK: How well said, how wonderful. Everyone, Deepa, please. Listening to her, I realized that even in the simplest conversations that we have with women, we\'re actually being aggressive. For example, I do tell my daughter sometimes, ""Yaar Tu hasti hai to mujhe accha lagta hai varna bura lagta hai"". So sorry, I would never do that. Aaj Se main meri beti ko yahi bolunga. Whatever you\'re doing, mujhe accha hi lagta hai, aur accha nahi bhi lagta hai Toh mera kya, tum wohi karo jo tumhare ko lagta hai, right?', '11:21': '(Applause)', '11:24': 'How did you feel, first listening to so many unfulfilled stories, desires, lack of independence, of girls that you normally would assume we think these girls are better off?', '11:37': 'DN: Very depressed. It was shocking for me, and that\'s why I couldn\'t stop, because I had no plans to do a study and no plans to write a book. I\'d written 17 books before, and I thought, ""I\'m done,"" but when I went to St. Stephen\'s College and I heard, at most elite colleges you well know from Delhi, and the young women and the men, what they said about what it meant to them to be a woman and man sounded not like me but like my mother\'s generation. So then I went to another college and another college. The thing that was striking to me is that each woman felt she was alone, that she hides her fear and hides her behavior, because she thinks it\'s a personal fault. It\'s not a personal fault, it\'s training, and I think that\'s the biggest revelation is that, if we stop pretending, then the world changes.', '12:31': 'SRK: Do you girls all agree with what Deepa is saying?', '12:33': '(Applause)', '12:36': 'Already see that young girl saying, ""Heard, heard what she said? You say this to me."" Yeah, that\'s the way it should be. You, boy, you adjust. We are not adjusting anymore, OK?', '12:45': '(Applause)', '12:47': 'Thank you so much. Have a good evening.

And they would go, ""Why would we do this? Is it for something? Is it celebrating a presidential visit? Is it the Entente Cordiale between France and England? Is it for charity?

And they\'d say, ""Why would we do this?""', '05:21': 'But after four years, this magic trick, this extraordinary thing happened. I was sitting in the same meeting I\'d been to for four years, saying, ""Please, please, may I?"" Instead of which, I didn\'t say, ""Please."" I said, ""This thing that we\'ve been talking about for such a long time, it\'s happening on these dates, and I really need you to help me."" This magic thing happened.

All these people were only being asked to do the thing that they could do that would help us. Nobody was being asked to take responsibility. And I, in my innocence, thought, ""Well, I\'ll take responsibility,"" for what turned out to be a million people on the street.', '06:28': 'It was our first show.', '06:29': '(Applause)', '06:33': 'It was our first show, and it changed the nature of the appreciation of culture, not in a gallery, not in a theater, not in an opera house, but live and on the streets, transforming public space for the broadest possible audience, people who would never buy a ticket to see anything.', '06:50': ""So there we were. We'd finished, and we've continued to produce work of this kind. As you can see, the company's work is astonishing, but what's also astonishing is the fact that permission was granted. And you don't see any security. And this was nine months after terrible terrorist bombings that had ripped London apart."", '07:15': ""So I began to wonder whether it was possible to do this kind of stuff in even more complicated circumstances. We turned our attention to Northern Ireland, the North of Ireland, depending on your point of view. This is a map of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, the island to the left. For generations, it's been a place of conflict, the largely Catholic republic in the south and the largely Protestant loyalist community -- hundreds of years of conflict, British troops on the streets for over 30 years. And now, although there is a peace process, this is today in this city, called Londonderry if you're a loyalist, called Derry if you're a Catholic. But everybody calls it home. And I began to wonder whether there was a way in which the community tribalism could be addressed through art and the imagination."", '08:11': ""This is what the communities do, every summer, each community. This is a bonfire filled with effigies and insignia from the people that they hate on the other side. This is the same from the loyalist community. And every summer, they burn them. They're right in the center of town."", '08:30': 'So we turned to here, to the Nevada desert, to Burning Man, where people also do bonfires, but with a completely different set of values. Here you see the work of David Best and his extraordinary temples, which are built during the Burning Man event and then incinerated on the Sunday.', '08:49': 'So we invited him and his community to come, and we recruited from both sides of the political and religious divide: young people, unemployed people, people who would never normally come across each other or speak to each other. And out of their extraordinary work rose a temple to rival the two cathedrals that exist in the town, one Catholic and one Protestant. But this was a temple to no religion, for everyone, for no community, but for everyone. And we put it in this place where everyone told me nobody would come. It was too dangerous. It sat between two communities. I just kept saying, ""But it\'s got such a great view.""', '09:28': '(Laughter)', '09:30': ""And again, that same old question: Why wouldn't we do this?"", '09:33': ""What you see in the picture is the beginning of 426 primary school children who were walked up the hill by the head teacher, who didn't want them to lose this opportunity. And just as happens in the Nevada desert, though in slightly different temperatures, the people of this community, 65,000 of them, turned out to write their grief, their pain, their hope, their hopes for the future, their love. Because in the end, this is only about love."", '10:03': 'They live in a post-conflict society: lots of post-traumatic stress, high suicide. And yet, for this brief moment -- and it would be ridiculous to assume that it was more than that -- somebody like Kevin -- a Catholic whose father was shot when he was nine, upstairs in bed -- Kevin came to work as a volunteer. And he was the first person to embrace the elderly Protestant lady who came through the door on the day we opened the temple to the public. It rose up. It sat there for five days. And then we chose -- from our little tiny band of nonsectarian builders, who had given us their lives for this period of months to make this extraordinary thing -- we chose from them the people who would incinerate it.', '10:52': 'And here you see the moment when, witnessed by 15,000 people who turned out on a dark, cold, March evening, the moment when they decided to put their enmity behind them, to inhabit this shared space, where everybody had an opportunity to say the things that had been unsayable, to say out loud, ""You hurt me and my family, but I forgive you."" And together, they watched as members of their community let go of this thing that was so beautiful, but was as hard to let go of as those thoughts and feelings that had gone into making it.', '11:39': '(Music)', '11:49': 'Thank you.', '11:51': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With his vast armies he became almost unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from invading their territory.', '00:42': 'No one knows how historically accurate that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating phenomenon, it’s important to understand the difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create.', '01:12': 'In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, summer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted glacial ice.', '01:40': 'Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great mountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for centuries that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different genders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers by grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully active glaciers that grow each year with additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting reserves of water that farmers can use to irrigate their crops.', '02:32': 'These practices have spread to other cultures, where people are creating their own versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious modern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten centimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: horizontal, and vertical.', '03:10': 'Horizontal glaciers are formed when farmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series of basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of water into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin with another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with irrigation for their fields.', '03:39': 'Local people make vertical glaciers using the meltwater from already-existing glaciers high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels that run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice sculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount of surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water to feed the farmers’ crops.', '04:24': 'These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier growing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness our homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s harshest landscapes.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One day, I was glancing through my bank statement (I didn\'t have much to look at) and I\'ve noticed that in the upper corner there was a symbol, that I\'m going to show you, saying that document had been made in plain language, for me to understand it. The idea interested me; I tried to find out what that was and I found out that there was a campaign for the simplification of language, which was the ""Plain English Campaign"". I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about one day or two, and I\'ve never thought about it since. When I came back to Portugal, for good, I came across with several documents - for example, my work contract, the papers I had to sign to buy a house, the electricity bill -- a series of documents that reminded me of that bank statement. Not because they were equally clear and simple, but because they were the exact opposite. Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, to begin to understand what was written there. And then, that little seed that had been sown in 1996, started germinating. And one day, I found myself entering through my boss\' office and quitting my job to dedicate myself to this. And so, what did I find out, right off the start? I found out that it was a much more severe problem than I thought. It wasn\'t only about these documents being complex and annoying, it was the fact that Portuguese people\'s literacy -- literacy is the hability to understand written documents -- is extremely low. I\'m going to show you a chart about Portuguese people\'s literacy [rate]. You know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,', '01:49': 'don\'t know how to read nor write at all, yet. Over there are those who know, or say they know, how to read and write. So, what do we have? We have that group of red people in level 1, which is the lowest in literacy [rate]. They are persons who are able to join letters, but they can\'t, actually, understand. For example, if a person, from that red group, has to pick up the package leaflet of a medicinal product, to give a dose of medicine to his/her child, he/she can\'t, can\'t understand the information. 50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more, those yellow ones, over there, people who get by on the daily basis. That is, if they don\'t have to read anything too new or too different, they will manage. But, for example, if they work in a factory and a new machine arrives and they have to read the machine\'s manual to be able to work with it, they can\'t do it anymore. And there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people. Then we have a few more that can handle documents, as long as they are not too complex, and we have 5% of the population that can handle really complex documents. Now, just so you don\'t think this is normal, that over there is Sweden. While we have 20% of people with the literacy considered essential for a daily basis, Sweden has 75%. And looking at that, what did I realize? I realized we live in an apartheid of information. I realized that there\'s a small minority of people who has indeed access to information and can use it to their advantage and a huge majority that can\'t. And because they can\'t, they are excluded and they are impaired. Let me give you an example. That one is Mr. Domingos, my building\'s doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27, so, he falls in that yellow group that we have seen a little while ago. From time to time, I\'m arriving home and he says: ""Miss Sandra!""; ""Yes, Mr. Domingos."" ""Here is a little letter."" So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood receives something that they don\'t understand, they come to me and I help them to translate it. And so, that time he said to me like this: ""Oh, Miss Sandra, I\'m about to throw this away, but check it if this is important."" It was very important. He had been waiting, for quite a while, to have a knee surgery and that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank checks. When a person is waiting for a long time, they get a bank check and with that bank check they can have that surgery in the private sector. It was almost thrown away into the garbage, Mr. Domingos\' letter. In that same year, I\'ve found out, only 20% of people had used these surgery-bank checks. The other 80%, I don\'t believe they had been cured while they were waiting. They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos: ""Ah! What\'s this? I\'m not understanding, it\'s going to the garbage"". They lost the opportunity to have the surgery they needed. What happens here? When people don\'t understand this has severe consequences -- to the individual, but also for the country. When I don\'t understand which are my rights, the benefits I can have access to, I can\'t understand my duties and I\'m not an active and participative citizen either. Now, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking: ""Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn\'t it? Me?! I\'m in the green ones."" ""I\'m absolutely sure that I\'m one of the green ones. I was selected to come to TED! Hum?"" (Laughter) So the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you and I\'m going to see what color are you when I finish reading. So, come on, this is an automobile insurance contract. It says this: ""Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided, in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last, in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary, to the heirs of the last"". Hum? (Laughter) Next, there\'s another one, from the medicines\' package leaflet, that says the following: ""Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."" Hum? Are you clear? And this one is really good. This one, I signed a renting contract to the new office on Friday and I laughed my head off. So, it said: ""I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune payment of the rents, waiving the benefits of the division and prior foreclosure."" When I heard ""opportune payment"" [""storm payment"" in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there, slamming the door and saying: ""Here\'s the money!!!"" (Laughter) But it\'s not! (Laughter) (Applause) But it\'s not! (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) So, it\'s this: when we leave our area of expertise -- and it only takes a little; there is no need to go to the string theory or something like that, it only takes a little... (Laughter) What happens? We get as lost as Mr. Domingos. And these documents are not written by experts to experts, as the ones from the string theory. No! These are documents written for me, these are the public documents, the public documents I need to understand in my daily life, to govern myself, to live my life. These are the renting contracts, the package leaflet of the medicines. It\'s all this. The electricity bills. This has to be clear, so that I can understand. Because, if I can\'t understand, what happens? I make mistakes, I get wrong. I\'m going to give you an example of mistakes that were committed, bad decisions made for not being able to understand documents. Do you remember the subprime crisis that took place in the United States? What happened? People signed those loans to buy houses, without truly understanding what they were signing. Because if they knew what they were signing, they\'d know that as soon as the interest rate started to rise, the monthly payment would also increase, they wouldn\'t be able to pay anymore and they would end up without a house. So, the rest, after that, next, everything crumbled down and we know the rest. Do you think that if there was a culture of clarity in the financial sector things would have got up to where they\'ve got? I don\'t think so. So, how do you solve this problem, this such big difference between the literacy [rate] of the Portuguese, that is down here, and the complexity of the public documents, those ones we need to understand in our daily lives, sorry, that are up here? So, the first think that comes to mind is, ""If literacy is down here, let\'s make it rise"" -- isn\'t it? Let\'s educate people. Let\'s, let\'s... of course we will, of course we will educate people. The thing is, it\'s hard and it\'s slow. And I don\'t even want to imagine how many generations it will take until we are at Sweden\'s level. But, besides that, it\'s not only because it is slow. There is another problem. If the language of the documents isn\'t simpler, we\'ve already seen that people, even with a high literacy level, like you, if the language is hard, they don\'t get cleared, they continue to be unable to understand these documents. So, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now, it\'s much more important to reduce the complexity of documents and simplify the language. I\'m going to show you an example. When I talk about simplifying the language. Notice! On the left side of a contract: ""It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, bla bla bla, bla bla..."" This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language? It\'s communicating in a simple and clear way, enabling our reader to understand it at first glance. What do you prefer? Before or after? There isn\'t much doubt, is there? So, how is this achieved? How can you make the State and companies communicate with citizens in a language they can understand at first glance? There are several ways. There are countries that are going by the path of legislation. For example, Sweden and the United States introduced, last year, a legislation that forces the State to communicate with people in a language they can understand. And you think, ""Well, that\'s normal. They are countries that are a bit ahead. ""Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States. ""But they are countries that are a bit ahead. ""It would be nice if in our country there was also legislation towards that, wouldn\'t it be?"" So it would. And there is! Since 1999. The Law of the Administrative Modernization says that the communication between the State and the people should be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, without acronyms, bla bla bla... But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question, the path of going through legislation, enforcing through legislation, works in those countries where laws are made to be applied. Now, there is another way, the way of marketing. How does that work? It\'s like this: private companies change their language; communicate in a clearer and simpler way, they make a big fuss about it, consumers love it, the sales rise, it works beautifully. But it works for the private sector. Now, what is the third path, and to me, the most important one? It\'s the path of civil movements, that are based in a mentality shift. In countries where this really went forward -- do you remember the English label, of the ""Plain English Campaign""? -- this is all based on a consumers\' movement. So, what does it take for that civic movement to happen? We need to understand two very important things: First, wanting to understand these public documents is not a whim, is not an intellectual curiosity. It is a necessity that I have in my daily life. And above all, it is a right, it is everyone\'s right. On this side we have: understanding is a right. And we have to understand another thing too, which is: he who writes, has to write in order to be understood. How do we get there? First of all: we have to become demanding consumers and citizens. Think it this way: next time someone gives you a document that you just simply don\'t understand, don\'t be shy, don\'t keep quiet, pretending that you are understanding everything. No! Demand to understand. Ask. I know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman in the little suite and say: ""Look here, this contract, this part, what does this mean?"" It\'s not easy, and perhaps it\'s even a bit embarrassing, isn\'t it? But it is not. It\'s a sign of intelligence. What do you teach your children when they have doubts in school? ""Don\'t say nothing to anyone, shut up really good and act smart."" No, you don\'t, right? You say: ""Look, when you don\'t understand, you put your hand up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared."" And that is exactly what we have to do, as consumers and citizens. So, next time you come across with a document you don\'t understand, demand to understand, put aside your pride and ask until you get completely cleared. Then, there\'s the other side, which is: ""Okay, these awful documents ""which are in circulation, they don\'t grow on trees. ""Someone wrote them."" Hum? Maybe, among this big group, some persons... I don\'t know, some lawyers, some public employees -- I\'m not asking you to identify yourselves, but I ask you to search your own conscience. How many times do you write documents for the general public, for people that don\'t share your language, and you write them in a language that only you will understand? And you\'ll say: ""Ah, that\'s because there is a reason, here!"" Dear friends, I already heard all the reasons. There are thousands of reasons. They go like these: ""Ah, it\'s the house\'s culture""; ""Oh, my boss!"" ""Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?"" ""What you want is to destroy language. We have to educate people."" ""We can\'t lower the level""; bla, bla, bla... I\'ve seen all of this. These are excuses. A while ago, they told us about Einstein. Einstein said this: ""If you can\'t write about a subject, in a simple way, it\'s because, in fact, you don\'t understand it."" So, if you... (Applause) To Einstein... (Applause) To Einstein...(Applause) So -- ah, ah, I don\'t have time! -- so, if you do know what you want to say -- don\'t you? -- you are aware of what you want to say, you just have to do one thing: believe that it is possible to write in a simple way. And how do you do that? It\'s very easy. You write to your grandmother. Hum? You write to your grandmother. I\'m going to show grandma to you. (Laughter) You write with respect and without paternalism. And you use three techniques that I\'m going to teach you. First of all: Start by the most important. Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read three pages to get to the main idea. Start by the most important. Next, use short sentences, because grandma, like anyone of us, if you make very long sentences, she gets to the end and she can\'t remember what you said in the beginning, anymore. And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones that grandma knows. Alright? It\'s easy! Before I leave, I would like to talk to you about ""Clara"" (Clear). ""Clara"" is a project of social responsibility. It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made. What do we do? We are going to launch this year a collection of ""Claro"" guides, that is, we are going to pick very, very, very complex subjects and put them simple. We are going to start with the ""Claro"" Guide of Justice. I think it is an area... that comes in handy. (Applause) And now I\'m going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]\'s advise. If it\'s time to ask, whoever wants to sponsor the ""Claro"" Guide of Justice -- I don\'t know... for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? -- come talk to me later. Another thing we will do is to grant prizes to the worse and best documents, because, indeed, there are people who are working to communicate in a clearer way, and that have to be rewarded, and there are lazy people that do nothing about it and need to be humiliated. So, we\'ll give prizes to the worst and to the best. I\'m counting on your help. (Applause) (Applause) We are going to launch... we are going to launch the campaign via Clara\'s Facebook, so, send your friendship request and you\'ll be up to date. But, lastly, above all, what does ""Clara"" want? It wants to put two little things in your heads. The first one: demand to understand. Don\'t be shy. And write in order to be understood. Write to your grandma. And if you don\'t have a grandmother, write to Mr. Domingos, he will like it. Thank you.

Each bit can switch between two states labeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, and what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information than one or zero. You can think of these positions as points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere represent one and zero. A bit can only switch between these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves into a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform particular operations while in this state.', '01:52': 'So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a classical computer would need bits.', '02:10': 'The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the state of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need such an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers remains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits in the same place at the same time.', '02:47': 'There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum states effectively: the types of particles a quantum computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits.', '03:04': 'A trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made of electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what operation to make by causing the qubit state to rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5.', '03:45': 'Superconducting qubit quantum computers do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits instead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit translate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical inputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to control each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to connect many smaller traps that communicate with each other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap. Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan.', '04:53': 'And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story I'm going to tell you happened over 200 million years before the dinosaurs went extinct. This story starts at the very beginning, when dinosaurs were just getting their start. One of the biggest mysteries in evolutionary biology is why dinosaurs were so successful. What led to their global dominance for so many years? When people think about why dinosaurs were so amazing, they usually think about the biggest or the smallest dinosaur, or who was the fastest, or who had the most feathers, the most ridiculous armor, spikes or teeth. But perhaps the answer had to do with their internal anatomy -- a secret weapon, so to speak. My colleagues and I, we think it was their lungs."", '01:02': 'I am both a paleontologist and a comparative anatomist, and I am interested in understanding how the specialized dinosaur lung helped them take over the planet. So we are going to jump back over 200 million years to the Triassic period. The environment was extremely harsh, there were no flowering plants, so this means that there was no grass. So imagine a landscape filled with all pine trees and ferns. At the same time, there were small lizards, mammals, insects, and there were also carnivorous and herbivorous reptiles -- all competing for the same resources.', '01:42': ""Critical to this story is that oxygen levels have been estimated to have been as low as 15 percent, compared to today's 21 percent. So it would have been crucial for dinosaurs to be able to breathe in this low-oxygen environment, not only to survive but to thrive and to diversify."", '02:03': 'So, how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like, since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton? The method that we use is called ""extant phylogenetic bracketing."" This is a fancy way of saying that we study the anatomy -- specifically in this case, the lungs and skeleton -- of the living descendants of dinosaurs on the evolutionary tree. So we would look at the anatomy of birds, who are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, and we\'d look at the anatomy of crocodilians, who are their closest living relatives, and then we would look at the anatomy of lizards and turtles, who we can think of like their cousins. And then we apply these anatomical data to the fossil record, and then we can use that to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs. And in this specific instance, the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely resembles that of modern birds.', '03:01': ""So, because dinosaurs were competing with early mammals during this time period, it's important to understand the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung. Also, to reintroduce you to lungs in general, we will use my dog Mila of Troy, the face that launched a thousand treats, as our model."", '03:18': '(Laughter)', '03:20': ""This story takes place inside of a chest cavity. So I want you to visualize the ribcage of a dog. Think about how the spinal vertebral column is completely horizontal to the ground. This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be in all of the animals that we'll be talking about, whether they walked on two legs or four legs."", '03:41': ""Now I want you to climb inside of the imaginary ribcage and look up. This is our thoracic ceiling. This is where the top surface of the lungs comes into direct contact with the ribs and vertebrae. This interface is where our story takes place. Now I want you to visualize the lungs of a dog. On the outside, it's like a giant inflatable bag where all parts of the bag expand during inhalation and contract during exhalation. Inside of the bag, there's a series of branching tubes, and these tubes are called the bronchial tree. These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen to, ultimately, the alveolus. They cross over a thin membrane into the bloodstream by diffusion."", '04:30': ""Now, this part is critical. The entire mammalian lung is mobile. That means it's moving during the entire respiratory process, so that thin membrane, the blood-gas barrier, cannot be too thin or it will break. Now, remember the blood-gas barrier, because we will be returning to this."", '04:51': ""So, you're still with me? Because we're going to start birds and it gets crazy, so hold on to your butts. (Laughter) The bird is completely different from the mammal. And we are going to be using birds as our model to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs."", '05:07': ""So in the bird, air passes through the lung, but the lung does not expand or contract. The lung is immobilized, it has the texture of a dense sponge and it's inflexible and locked into place on the top and sides by the ribcage and on the bottom by a horizontal membrane. It is then unidirectionally ventilated by a series of flexible, bag-like structures that branch off of the bronchial tree, beyond the lung itself, and these are called air sacs."", '05:41': 'Now, this entire extremely delicate setup is locked into place by a series of forked ribs all along the thoracic ceiling. Also, in many species of birds, extensions arise from the lung and the air sacs, they invade the skeletal tissues -- usually the vertebrae, sometimes the ribs -- and they lock the respiratory system into place. And this is called ""vertebral pneumaticity."" The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity are two clues that we can hunt for in the fossil record, because these two skeletal traits would indicate that regions of the respiratory system of dinosaurs are immobilized.', '06:30': 'This anchoring of the respiratory system facilitated the evolution of the thinning of the blood-gas barrier, that thin membrane over which oxygen was diffusing into the bloodstream. The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier, and the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated like a mammalian lung.', '06:57': ""So why do we care about this? Why does this even matter? Oxygen more easily diffuses across a thin membrane, and a thin membrane is one way of enhancing respiration under low-oxygen conditions -- low-oxygen conditions like that of the Triassic period. So, if dinosaurs did indeed have this type of lung, they'd be better equipped to breathe than all other animals, including mammals."", '07:32': 'So do you remember the extant phylogenetic bracket method where we take the anatomy of modern animals, and we apply that to the fossil record? So, clue number one was the forked ribs of modern birds. Well, we find that in pretty much the majority of dinosaurs. So that means that the top surface of the lungs of dinosaurs would be locked into place, just like modern birds.', '08:01': ""Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity. We find this in sauropod dinosaurs and theropod dinosaurs, which is the group that contains predatory dinosaurs and gave rise to modern birds. And while we don't find evidence of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs, vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence of what the lung was doing during the life of these animals. Lung tissue or air sac tissue was invading the vertebrae, hollowing them out just like a modern bird, and locking regions of the respiratory system into place, immobilizing them. The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity together were creating an immobilized, rigid framework that locked the respiratory system into place that permitted the evolution of that superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier that we see today in modern birds."", '09:04': ""Evidence of this straightjacketed lung in dinosaurs means that they had the capability to evolve a lung that would have been able to breathe under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic period. This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs would have given them a significant adaptive advantage over other animals, particularly mammals, whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic. This anatomy may have been the secret weapon of dinosaurs that gave them that advantage over other animals. And this gives us an excellent launchpad to start testing the hypotheses of dinosaurian diversification."", '09:53': ""This is the story of the dinosaurs' beginning, and it's just the beginning of the story of our research into this subject."", '10:02': 'Thank you.', '10:03': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feeling feelings is part of being human."", '00:10': '[The Way We Work]', '00:14': ""A pervasive myth exists that emotions don't belong at work, and this often leads us to mistakenly equate professionalism with being stoic or even cold. But research shows that in the moments when our colleagues drop their glossy professional presentation, we're actually much more likely to believe what they're telling us. We feel connected to the people around us. We try harder, we perform better and we're just generally kinder. So it's about time that we learn how to embrace emotion at work."", '00:42': ""Now, that's not to say you should suddenly become a feelings fire hose. A line exists between sharing, which builds trust, and oversharing, which destroys it. If you suddenly let your feelings run wild at work and give people far more information than they bargained for, you make everyone around you uncomfortable and you also undermine yourself. You're more likely to be seen as weak or lacking self awareness, so, great to say you weren't feeling well last night -- you don't need to go into every lurid detail about how you got reacquainted with your half-digested dinner."", '01:15': ""So there's a wide spectrum of emotional expression. On one hand, you have under-emoters, or people who have a hard time talking about their feelings, and on the other end are over-emoters, those who constantly share everything that's going on inside, and neither of these make for a healthy workplace."", '01:33': ""So what's the balance between these two extremes? It's something called selective vulnerability. Selective vulnerability is opening up while still prioritizing stability and psychological safety, both for you and for your colleagues. Luckily, anyone can learn to be selectively vulnerable, with practice."", '01:52': 'Here are four ways to get started. First, flag your feelings without becoming emotionally leaky. Bad moods are contagious, and even if you\'re not vocalizing what you\'re feeling, chances are your body language or your expressions are a dead giveaway. So if you are crossing your arms or hammering on your keyboard, your coworkers are going to know you\'re upset. And if you don\'t say anything, they might start to think it\'s about them and get worried. So if you are reacting to a non-work-related event, so traffic for example, just flag it. You don\'t need to go into detail. You can say something as simple as ""I\'m having a bad morning. It has nothing to do with you."" Now if it\'s a work-related event that\'s causing you to feel strong emotions, that brings us to point number two.', '02:34': 'Try to understand the need behind your emotion, and then address that need. If you suddenly start to find everyone around you irritating, sit back and reflect on that. And it might be that you\'re irritable because you\'re anxious, and you\'re anxious because you\'re worried about hitting a looming deadline. And in that case, you can go back to your team to address that need and say something like, ""I want to make sure I get everything done ahead of the deadline. Can you help me put together a realistic plan to do that?"" If you\'re thinking of sharing, try and put yourself in the other person\'s shoes. So if what you\'re about to say would help you feel more supported and better understand the situation, then go ahead and share it. But if it gives you any kind of pause, you might want to leave it out.', '03:17': ""And finally, read the room and provide a path forward. If everyone on your team has been pulling long hours, and you notice that one of your colleagues seems particularly deflated or anxious, you can acknowledge that and show some empathy, but then try to give them something actionable that they could hold on to. And in this case, you could suggest that you go to your manager and ask that your weekly meeting be pushed back a day so you both have more time to work. You're showing you're invested in their success, but also that you care about their well-being."", '03:46': ""When we can be honest about what we feel, and freely suggest ideas, make mistakes and just not have to hide every piece of who we are, we're much more likely to stay at the company for a long time. We're also happier and more productive."", '04:00': ""So take a moment to reflect on the emotional expression that you bring to work each day. And if you are prone to oversharing, try editing. And if you're a little bit more reserved, look for moments when you can open up to your colleagues and be a bit vulnerable. And chances are, there will be a big difference in how people respond to you. And selective vulnerability might just become one of your most valuable tools.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless, fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus.', '01:11': 'Adhesive tube feet run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing their muscles, they draw water in and out over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree that extracts oxygen from seawater.', '01:38': 'Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated, they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests.', '02:09': 'But even sea cucumbers that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools to defend themselves. They evade threats and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application is employed when a predator attacks.', '02:51': 'By loosening the attachments of internal tissues then quickly softening and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective defense mechanism. In addition to startling and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time.', '03:22': 'Aside from the few species that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas.', '03:47': 'As these sausage-shaped wonders trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through the digestive tract of a sea cucumber.', '04:27': 'So next time you’re rejoicing in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, consider this: those very grains of sand might have, at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle that breathes through its butt.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our eyes are how we find partners, how we understand the people around us, how we read, and how we watch game shows on TV where people get knocked into cold water by padded wrecking balls. Yup, the human eye is pretty neat, and we\'re lucky enough to have two of them. But, there are things that, despite looking really hard, we still can\'t quite see. For example, you can watch a horse galloping, but your eyes can\'t keep up with its fast-moving hooves enough to figure out whether all four feet are ever off the ground simultaneously. For these types of questions, we need cameras. About 150 years ago, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one to solve the galloping horse mystery. Using careful photography, Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops, a horse really is flying. ""Look, ma! No hooves!"" Since then, photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science. It enhances our understanding of a world we thought we could already see, but it\'s one which we really need help to see a little better. It\'s not always a matter of the world moving by too quickly for our eyes to process. Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye. Botanists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism, growing towards the light. Mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier. Meteorologists and environmental scientists show the growth of major hurricanes and the recession over the years of many of the world\'s glaciers. Slow-motion film or high-speed photography have shown us the beating of a hummingbird\'s wings and the course of a bullet through its target. In one project, cadavers, that\'s dead bodies, were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs. The discs were photographed to produced animated movies that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton, and into the flesh, and through the bones, and the veins, and, perhaps I should have suggested you don\'t watch this during dinner, my bad. In classrooms today, the camera, now present in just about every phone and computer, allows the youngest scientists to observe the world around them, to document it, and to share their findings online.

Tech investor Roger McNamee presents 6 bold ways to prepare for the next internet.",0:15:26,15.43333333,344463,2011-11-12T14:59:36+00:00,"['Internet', 'TEDx', 'business', 'future', 'investment', 'technology']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Roger McNamee,Tech investor,"{'00:05': 'Have you ever been in the position of watching Silicon Valley take off and wish that you had known what was about to happen?', '00:14': '(Laughter)', '00:18': ""So, I'm here to talk about what I think is going to be the most intense disruption of the technology world that's occurred in the last 15 years. And I believe the end product of it will be entirely about engagement. In fact, I think it is possibly a transformational change in the way we're going to think about engagement."", '00:41': 'So what would you do if you knew today that there was going to be a major technology cycle beginning in the next couple years, and that you could participate in it? What would you do?', '00:57': '(Audience) Jump in!', '00:58': ""So, this is the situation in which I find myself: I'm a professional investor about half the day, the daylight half. I was paying close attention earlier, and I now know I need to have 10 hours sleep at night, which is tricky, because last night the show ended about 12:30, and so I was, I got -- and that was in Santa Rosa, so I got home a little late. I want you to understand, I've been studying the technology world, and things have already begun to change. But they're changing in ways that I see literally no commentator referring to today."", '01:32': ""There are six things going on that I'm going to focus on. I want you to understand, each one of these is a hypothesis; it is subject to revision. It may even be subject to elimination. But I want you to understand I've been working with this group of hypotheses now for about 10 months, and what's really interesting is that I've been exposing them to a lot of people in the industry, and people have been finding it very hard to debunk them. So I'm going to share them with you today, because I think collectively, we have a chance of figuring this out."", '02:00': 'The first thing -- and I think this is fairly obvious -- is: Windows is dying. And --', '02:06': '(Applause)', '02:08': ""I mean no disrespect to Microsoft, because I think, in fact, Microsoft as a company has many things it can do to maintain growth, but desktops would not be one of them. And the key indicator here, and the only one you need to know to understand what's going on here, is that smartphones have basically taken Windows from 96% of internet-connected devices 3 or 4 years ago, to under 50% now. And it is falling precipitously; they'll be under 30 percent, probably about a year and a half from now."", '02:42': ""Microsoft has lots of things it can do. It can retreat to Exchange and crank the price there. But the reason this is so significant is that Windows and Enterprise software, which is related to it -- think SAP and people like that -- those businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. And I'm suggesting we're going to have a jump ball for that revenue. And in a world where the US economy is not growing that rapidly, having somebody go away is the simplest way to create room for new industries. And this is where the revenues are going to come from. But guess what? Like a Ginsu knife commercial, there's more!"", '03:20': '(Laughter)', '03:22': 'It turns out Microsoft is not the only company whose body is lying across the railroad tracks today. Another one is Google. Now, you may not have focused on this, but index search accounted for 90% of all search volume about 4 years ago. But an interesting thing happened. Google got to be so successful that the index became full of garbage. In fact, the entire Web has become full of garbage. If you think about it, the Web has become almost a digital Detroit.', '03:58': '(Laughter)', '03:59': ""If you look hard enough, you can find really compelling things there. But if you aren't really careful, you can get mugged."", '04:08': '(Laughter)', '04:09': 'And it is no shock that each one of us and everyone else out there have looked for other ways to find the things we want to find. We started with Wikipedia, but then Facebook came along for matters of taste and money; Twitter came along for real-time news; LinkedIn, for professional things; Match.com, for less professional things; TripAdvisor for travel, Yelp for restaurants, Realtor.com for finding a home, Dictionary.com for words, Wordnik for the whole language. So the thing has really changed.', '04:40': ""And here's what's interesting: like Microsoft, Google has plenty of ways to respond in terms of growing its business. But what it cannot do is recover its position as the dominant player on the internet. It is my belief that when Google came along in 1998, the internet was an open-source, long-tail world with no leader. And Google stepped into this void, provided leadership and implemented a strategy that systematically commoditized all forms of content. And the simplest way to look at it is to look at a Google results page: the only logo on that page is Google's; everything else is in the same font. That form of commoditization has been tremendous for Google and horrible for almost everyone else. And I believe, to a first order, it is over -- not because index search is going away, but because, like word processing, it's gone from the most important application we all had, to just another thing we do. And you see this in mobile in particular. Because in mobile, people have found other ways to find what they want. Index search is too disruptive on a cell phone, so the rate of index search is a small fraction on cell phones to what it is on desktops. And that is the leading indicator that Google's recovery, if you will, will be in something other than search."", '06:03': 'The third hypothesis I have is no longer controversial, but it\'s important to understand what happened. If the left-hand side of this equation is the open-source World Wide Web, with its belief in the long tail, its belief in an absence of regulation, of an absence of security and control, it\'s really a frontier. Apple came along with a different vision. They said, ""We think the Web is dead. We\'re going to go on the internet, because that\'s the big data store, and we\'re going to provide you with branded, thoughtful, value-added, copyright-protected content."" And people have overwhelmingly chosen that over Google\'s vision. Over the last three years, Apple\'s gone from being an also-ran in computers to this year they will ship approximately 100 million internet-enabled devices. One hundred million. They\'ll probably be just short of that. The point here is, it\'s Apple\'s world. We\'re lucky to be part of it, because Steve is quite intolerant about who he lets in.', '07:10': '(Laughter)', '07:11': 'But think about this: imagine Georgia in the Civil War. OK? Apple is Sherman, World Wide Web is Joe Johnston. And the point is, they\'ve lost. So the Web is looking at this and going, ""My God, we\'ve got to come back."" And the cost in order to do this is they have to sacrifice Google. So Google has pushed the pendulum of technology to the absolute limit of commoditization, to the point where people who spent their whole lives developing really valuable, compelling entertainment and really valuable, compelling journalism and really valuable, compelling novels, can\'t make money doing it anymore. So the Web said, ""OK, if Google\'s over here, and Apple\'s here, HTML 5, the next generation, is going to be on the other side of Apple."" So the new battle, instead of being commoditization versus the App Store, is going to be between the App Store and highly differentiated content.', '08:04': ""If you don't know what HTML 5 is, let me help you understand. It is a programming language. But it's a profound one. Because for the first time, you're going to be able to construct a web page where the entire thing can have embedded interactivity, can have video, audio, whatever it is that you want. But no more Flash boxes. And it's a huge, huge change, because it essentially opens up a new canvas. And it doesn't just open it up for The New York Times, it opens it up for everybody on WordPress, it opens it up for every band ... Because suddenly, the ability to produce a differentiated, highly compelling, value-added -- maybe even monetizable -- product will be there. And what's really interesting is, thanks to Apple, there's nothing that commoditizers can do about you. Apple may try to stop us, but I don't think they will. I think they're smarter than that. So the key point is, I don't know where we're going to stop as the pendulum swings back. But I think the days of hypercommoditization are behind us. And we can all play in this. In a moment I'm going to tell you how I'm doing it personally."", '09:14': ""Tablets. This is the other side of why Windows is dead. If any of you does not own an iPad -- Look, I don't own any Apple stock, so I have no axe in this, but seriously, if you don't own an iPad, you cannot possibly understand the most important things going on now."", '09:32': '(Laughter)', '09:33': ""No, I'm really serious about this. And I think the most important point is that the other players on this thing, at the moment, have made no impact. And keep in mind, it was our investment that built Palm's webOS that HP's shipping soon, eventually, someday."", '09:50': '(Laughter)', '09:52': ""I think it's highly probable Apple wins this thing with market share closer to what they have on the iPod than to what they have on the iPhone. That would be 70 or 80%. If that's right, Apple's going to be 50 to 100 billion dollars bigger in a few years than they are today. And I literally don't see anybody else even challenging them. It's really important to understand that Apple's cost structure is so favorable relative to everybody else, it's almost impossible to imagine any of the cell phone guys, particularly Android guys, catching up. Because Apple's gross margins exceed the retail price of almost every Android phone."", '10:31': 'Here is the one that I want to leave you with as an investment idea, first and foremost. The mania on Wall Street is about social. Social is a sideshow. And I say this as somebody whose fund has most of its money in Facebook. It is a one-off. This is not ... To borrow a phrase from Star Wars: this is not the mania you are looking for. The one we\'re talking about will be so much bigger than this. Facebook has won. It is the new Windows. OK? A few other guys -- Twitter, Yelp, Skype, LinkedIn -- are building successful platforms that are much smaller than what Facebook has. And they\'ll be successful. But everybody else coming along is going to have to follow the Zynga model. They\'re going to have to make themselves subordinate to the platform of Facebook. And Zynga\'s inability to build anything successful off of Facebook, I think, is the key indicator of why this platform is so powerful. So if you do a start-up today in the social world, build it on top of Facebook. It\'s the only piece of advice I can give you. But the most important piece of advice is: forget social. Social is now a feature, it\'s not a platform. So embed social, the same way that Catherine said, ""Embed gamification into everything."" It\'s all about engagement. The future is going to be different. And the core question is: What are we all going to do about it?', '12:00': 'What I do is very simple: I believe in full-contact investing. So I looked at HTML 5 about a year ago, and I said, ""This thing could be really important. How do I find out?"" So my band, Moonalice, which, a couple years ago, did an album with T Bone Burnett, that we thought was going to be a huge hit and blah, blah, blah ... Well, we learned that nobody cared about hippie music done by old folks, so --', '12:24': '(Laughter)', '12:25': 'So we put it all onto the net, went on Facebook and Twitter. We started doing things called ""Twittercasts,"" the first live concerts and then prerecorded concerts, distributed over Twitter. Then we started using live stream, the same thing we\'re using here today, to do internet-based live video of our shows. And then recently, we bought a satellite network. Why? \'Cause it cost less than three months of what our manager used to cost.', '12:46': '(Laughter)', '12:48': 'And right now, we broadcast every one of our shows -- other than the U2 show -- live, in HTML 5, via satellite, in a system we totally control. We have an app that\'s about to ship within the next month. It\'s -- ""app"" is the wrong term; our website is being upgraded to HTML 5. And in it, you will be able, from any phone, anywhere, to play any song we\'ve ever played live and view any live video that we have, which is 150, 200 shows.', '13:19': ""Now, it cost practically nothing to do this. And we're this teeny-weeny little band. Now, I know more about technology than most people, but that's just because I know more than most people who are 55. But people who are 18 to 20, who live in this world, are going to be able to use these platforms in music and everywhere else in a fundamentally different way. I think creativity is coming back. Moonalice is something that's built around that. We have poster artists for every single show. We have photographers who work every show, we have painters. And the notion is, I believe that creativity has been stifled, not so much by technology, but by the general deterioration of American culture -- you know, people's unwillingness to be educated, this notion that we have to fall back on ritual and beliefs, instead of facts. But I think technology is finally going to do us a favor."", '14:16': ""I think it's finally going to give us the tools to make us independent. And there's little glimmers, right? We see the Arab Spring and the impact that Twitter and Facebook had. Pretty exciting. But imagine a world in which everything is an app. In HTML 5, digital Detroit gets replaced by this thing where every tweet is an app, every advertisement is an instance of a store. Think about what that means. So instead of seeing an Amazon display ad, you see the store, say, on the New York Times Book Review. You can both create demand and satisfy it in the same place. Why? Because that's better for everybody. Saves time, increases engagement, because it keeps you on the page. We're going from a web of elevators, where you go to different places, and you go off sites and you lose people, to a control panel model. And guess who's going to make it? You are."", '15:21': 'Thank you very much.', '15:22': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Laughter) My name is Eddie Jaku, and I\'m standing in front of you today, a survivor of the Holocaust and a witness of the most tragic times in the history of mankind. I was a proud young German. I thought this was the best civilization that could be given to a young man like me. How wrong I was. On the 9th of November, 1938, I returned from boarding school where I had lived under a false name for five years because I was a Jew. I lived away from my family, like an orphan, getting an education and under enormous pressure and fear that somebody could find out that I was not Walter Shleiss who I pretended to be. I was in great danger. On that fateful night, I had arrived home, but my family had gone in hiding, and I was alone. I went to bed with my dog close by. At 5 a.m., on the 10th of November, 1938, ten Nazis broke down the door of our house. What they did to me, I am ashamed to tell you. It was so bad that I believed, ""Eddie, you\'re going to die today."" After, they made me witness the demolition of our 200-year-old house and murdering my beloved dog, Lulu, who had tried to protect me, in front of my eyes. I lost my dignity, my freedom, and my faith in humanity. I lost everything I lived for. I was reduced from a man to being nothing. What happened to my country where I was born in, the country of my ancestors, the country which produced [Schiller], Goethe, Beethoven, and Mozart? What had happened to my German friends who became murderers? At the time, none of us understood that ""Kristallnacht"" - the ""Night of Broken Glass"" where the fronts of Jewish-owned shops were smashed, and the shops looted, and homes and synagogues were set on fire - was only the beginning of the nightmare of much, much worse to come. That day, I was transported to my first concentration camp, Buchenwald, where I was kept with another 11,000 Jewish men for about five months. On the 2nd of May, 1939, I was released. My father picked me up and brought me to Aachen. After 10 hours driving, we made an arrangement with a smuggler to take us into Belgium. I spent two weeks there with my dad in an apartment until I was arrested by Belgium police as a German, not a Jew. and interned in a camp with 4,000 other Germans. On the 10th of May, 1940, the camp was liquidated. We split up in Dunkirk, and I continued on to Lyon. There, I was arrested by French police and sent to Gurs, a terrible camp with 6,000 Germans. After my internments at camps, I was finally transported to what became my hell on earth: Auschwitz. My parents and sister were also transported to Auschwitz, and I was never to see my parents again. I did not have a chance to say goodbye to my beloved mother, and I have missed her every day of my life. If you have the opportunity today, please go home and make sure you tell your mom how much you love her. Please do this for your new friend, Eddie. I was lucky enough, managed to escape what became known as the death march. and I hid in a forest, alone, for many months, before I was found by the American army. But I\'m standing here today a happy man, who enjoys life with a wonderful wife and a beautiful family. I do not hate anyone. Hate is a disease which may destroy your enemy, but will also destroy you in the process. (Applause) I\'m doing everything I can to make this world a better place for everyone, and I implore you all to do your best too. Let us ensure that this terrible tragedy, the worst in the history, may never happen again and also will never, ever be forgotten. After many years of hardship and hiding, on the 7th September, 1945, after a long journey by train, I entered back into Belgium without any papers. Very shortly after that, I met and married my wife, Flore, to whom I have been married for 73 years. (Cheers) (Applause) Thank you. At that time, I was not a happy man. (Laughter) (Chuckles) I did not enjoy being amongst people. That was until our first son, Michael, was born. At that time, my heart was healed and my happiness returned in abundance. I made the promise that from that day until the end of my life, I promised to be happy, smile, be polite, helpful, and kind. I also promised to never put my foot on German soil again. Today, I stand in front of you, a man who has kept all those promises. My greatest happiness comes from my family, my wife, two sons - Michael and Andre - my many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who all bring so much joy. Today, I teach and share happiness with everyone I meet. Happiness does not fall from the sky; it\'s in your hands. If you\'re healthy and happy, you\'re a millionaire. (Chuckles) Happiness also brings good health to the body and mind, and I attribute my 99 years of health mostly to the positive and happy attitude. (Applause) One flower is my garden; one good friend is my world. Young people today forget to stop. They\'re constantly running and don\'t know where they\'re running to. (Laughter) You should take time to be happy and enjoy life. There\'s a time to laugh and there\'s a time to cry. I see good things in life. Invite a friend or family member for a meal. Go for a walk. Tomorrow will come, but first enjoy today! (Applause) I wonder how people exist without friendship, without people to share their secrets, hopes, and dreams, to share good fortune or sad losses. In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasure, good times made better and bad times forgotten - due to the magic of friendship. For me, when I wake up, I\'m happy because it is another day to enjoy. When I remember that I should have died a miserable death, but instead I\'m alive, so I aim to help people who are down. I was at the bottom of the pit. So If I can make one miserable person smile, I\'m happy. (Applause) Remember these words: Please do not walk in front of me - I may not be able to follow. Please do not walk behind me - I may not be able to lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend. (Applause) I will end my talk with a wish from my heart to all your hearts. May you always have lots of love to share, lots of good health to spare, and lots of good friends that care. Thank you for giving me the privilege of speaking to you today. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this talk, he shares his extraordinary life story and describes AMD's 50x15 initiative that calls for connecting 50 percent of the world by 2015.",0:19:39,19.65,343440,2008-05-01T05:00:00+00:00,"['Africa', 'education', 'global issues', 'philanthropy', 'technology']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Hector Ruiz,CEO,"{'00:09': ""You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm -- at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident, technology played a big role in that."", '00:45': ""So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context, I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology: why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned, that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15. And then I'll come back to the beginning, and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today's world, it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about, but to have a passion for something that is meaningful."", '01:39': ""So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. (Laughter) And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this: I was born in a very small village in Mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning, and I'll come back to that a little bit later."", '02:24': ""But one of the things that exposed me early to learning, and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child, was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard, and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow -- to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but, by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old, and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever, and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites, was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too, when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music, in some way, represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech, but if you can imagine the time when this occurred -- it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech."", '03:51': 'Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that, people ask me and say, ""Well, how did your parents treat you when you were a child?"" And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of, where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up, both my mother and father would always say to me, it\'s really important that you always remember two things. First of all, when you go to bed at night, you\'ve got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something, and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said: and we trust you, that no matter where you are or where you go, you will always do the right thing. Now, I don\'t know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it\'s the most pressure you can put on a child, to say -- (Laughter) -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words -- (Laughter)', '05:04': ""-- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So, one of our passions in our company, and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable. And to me, that is very, very critical."", '05:43': ""Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet, frankly, is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred, that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today, the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way, accessibility, in an easy manner, and also affordability, that regardless of the economic status that a person could have, that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology."", '06:52': ""So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD, we came up with this idea of saying, what if we create this initiative we call 50x15, where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments, industry, educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors. So, it is really a rather lofty initiative, if you want to think that way, but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead, that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative."", '08:05': ""Where are we today? That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com. Those of you who've never looked at their website, you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015, the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world, defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States, has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase."", '08:42': ""As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable, even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good -- has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact, I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki, and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster? And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost, to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So, when you look at this chart, you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale -- you look at the very end: we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent. But we're excited in our company; we're motivated. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things, to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually, working with so many partners around the world, to be able to reach that goal."", '10:09': ""Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15, which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world, and call it the education market. When you look at elementary-school children, we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute."", '11:23': ""It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions. What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed. It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same. And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So, there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it."", '12:06': ""It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts, it doesn't. In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece, which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems."", '12:59': ""What I mean by that, and let me use this example, the country of South Africa, because I was just there, therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging. It's beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. They're developing a software-training environment in their universities. What a place, what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two -- English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system, it could only be done from inside. I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world, and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So, we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large, and there's an infrastructure that can provide it, that a local, integrated, end-to-end system is really critical for its success."", '14:11': ""This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico, in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico -- Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes, and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids, in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa, in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School, and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal. And recently, they've written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal."", '15:19': ""We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries, and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesn't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected, it's a start. And we are learning a lot. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective."", '15:45': ""One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies -- Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient."", '17:00': ""We also have partnered with TED in this project, with Architecture for Humanity, and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair, we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this, and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity."", '17:25': ""Let me come back to the beginning, to end this presentation. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business, is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet, and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it."", '17:48': 'And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents -- and I\'ll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it, but he said to me, when I went to college, he said, ""You\'re the first person in the family to go to college. And it\'s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress, each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."" Frankly, I don\'t know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study, and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, ""You know, I\'m going to remind you again, that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was, because that\'s how you make progress."" And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was, and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me, like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child, my first child, and again, my father comes to the hospital, and we\'re looking at the glass, and see all the children on the other side, and he said, ""I\'ve got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better, you\'re going to have to be a better father than I was."" That\'s when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.  But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. It\'s got to be that someday I can look back, and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much. (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What does this all mean for us? What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics, computing power, low latencies, these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor."", '00:52': ""When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites. As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings, the Web matching, the index crawling. But we want to use our brain! We want to navigate, explore, discover information. In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer."", '01:18': ""So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day? Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life? So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge. So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin? Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem."", '02:10': ""Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition, it's multi-spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in."", '02:42': ""We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials, kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam? The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. (Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here. But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job."", '03:23': 'We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web, just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.', '03:53': ""When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math. You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact, it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software, algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream."", '04:43': ""We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives? An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model? I'll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is -- people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller."", '05:17': ""So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history. The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles."", '05:42': ""What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with, and really derive insights from you, from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time.

Oh, please don't do this at home."", '02:03': '(Laughter)', '02:04': 'Now, the kid saw this, grabbed his own tube and promptly stuck it up his own nose, kind of like this.', '02:19': '(Applause)', '02:24': ""The clowns, the nurse and the patient discovered a creative solution for their situation together.

My colleague and I were invited to accompany a young six-year-old with the most adorable southern accent, to accompany him while he got his chemotherapy port flushed, a very uncomfortable and regular procedure. We joined him, his mom and the nurse in this tiny, closed curtain cubicle. Every medical clown encounter begins by obtaining consent from the patient. So we ask him if we can be there. He says, ""Sure."" We\'re often the one element that a child could control while they\'re in the hospital.', '03:13': 'So we start with a card trick, fan the deck so he can pick. But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle to flush the port, he starts screaming and cussing like no six-year-old I\'d ever heard in my life. So we say, ""Hey, should we come back later?"" He stops, mouth open, eyes wet with tears, face flushed pink with anger, and he smiles, ""Oh no, you\'re fine, I want you to be here."" OK. So we start playing a song, my colleague on recorder, me on whoopee cushion. The nurse approaches with the needle, and it happens again, this torrent of four-letter words.', '03:49': 'He went from playing and laughing to screaming and crying, back and forth until the procedure was complete.

The family's hurting as they navigate uncertainty, grief and the financial burdens of care. The staff is hurting, only it's more than burnout.

Deam,Designer,"{'00:04': 'I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.', '00:25': ""So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look. When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer. So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion. I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces. In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that. In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin."", '01:43': ""That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell. We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell. We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in."", '02:30': ""The main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence. The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer. There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes. So that became a challenge. Compounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions. It's a compound curve interior. What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell."", '03:21': ""What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell. And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase. That's the trailer, pretty much finished."", '03:51': 'That trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block. Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October. Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo. He said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one. Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.', '04:19': ""We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours. This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system. It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this. And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense. A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream."", '04:51': 'This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream. They came to me and said, ""Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up? And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?"" And I said, ""Well, not in that interior."" (Laughter) Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it\'s called the Bambi prototype. I thought, ""Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I\'m gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding."" And I walked in their prototype facility, and it\'s exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things. So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there\'s no money for tooling or molding. The trailers themselves are actually hand-built. All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can\'t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit. They didn\'t want to go to a componentized system. And there it is, that\'s the Bambi 16.

We're talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here."", '00:17': 'So as a hint, this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots, sometimes thousands of mobile robots, moving around a warehouse. And I\'ll get to the solution. But for a moment, just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt. So — click! — you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too — click! And maybe a blue pair of shoes — click! So at this point you\'ve assembled your order. You didn\'t stop to think for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit ""submit order."" And two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and you\'re like, wow, there\'s my goo.', '01:01': ""Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse? So I'm here to tell you it's that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture, you see a classic pick-pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will spend 60 or 70 percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. They'll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders, it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders."", '01:41': ""So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area in '99, 2000, the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called Webvan. (Laughter) This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively. Turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory into a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars. Imagine, we had an 89¢ can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home."", '02:31': ""So long story short, during my one year at Webvan, what I realized by talking to all the material-handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box. So we said, there's just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores."", '02:55': ""Of course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later, I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker, or my vision for how it should work. (Laughter) I said, let's focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red, green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and — poof! — the product shows up and I pack it into the order, and now we're thinking, this would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem? But as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem, and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible."", '03:49': 'So how did I arrive at this notion? Well, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise, probably a technique that many of you use, It\'s this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet, of course, but then test your ideas at the limits — infinity, zero. In this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea: What if we had to build a distribution center in China, where it\'s a very, very low-cost market? And say, labor is cheap, land is cheap. And we said specifically, ""What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million- square-foot distribution center?"" So naturally that led to ideas that said, ""Let\'s put lots of people in the warehouse."" And I said, ""Hold on, zero dollars per hour, what I would do is \'hire\' 10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m., walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew, you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it, I\'ll call you, otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front — pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."" Wow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own? That\'s a very interesting, very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse.', '05:07': ""So of course, labor isn't free, on that practical versus awesome spectrum. (Laughter) So we said mobile shelving — We'll put them on mobile shelving. We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008. Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies? I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. I'm like, that was the idea! (Laughter and Applause) We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor. But interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art, all without computers, I'm told, it was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication. You stand up, I'll squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey."", '06:11': ""So of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea? Here is a warehouse. It's a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs. We'll call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post-It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves, take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick worker's life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her."", '06:50': ""So the process is very productive. Reach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out. By the time you turn around, there's another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what we've done is take out all of the non-value added walking, searching, wasting, waited time, and we've developed a very high-fidelity way to pick these orders, where you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode, and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive, more accurate and, it turns out, it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment."", '07:36': ""So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going to be more productive. But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross-fertilization of ideas. Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have 10 workers on the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom, it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you, you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse."", '08:41': ""And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking the popularity of the products. And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentine's Day, and that candy, the leftover candy, has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. (Laughter) So whether you're doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations, or 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves."", '09:45': ""So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands what's going on in each station, we direct the pods across the highway and we're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time, never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders."", '10:56': 'The reason we can say that, though, is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes we\'ll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as, they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren, or in one case a guy said, ""the Kiva zone is so stress-free that I\'ve actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication."" (Laughter) That was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video. (Laughter)', '11:30': ""So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online, you break it open and the goo is in there, you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order."", '11:54': 'Thank you. (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's Sharky."", '00:24': '(Laughter)', '00:25': ""I joined 10 years ago because I wanted female role models, and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media. We make up half the population of the world, but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. And we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories. And now, with today's technology, it's possible to remove women from the picture completely."", '00:53': ""This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors, tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden. You can see Hillary Clinton on the right. Let's see how the photo ran in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn. Hillary's completely gone."", '01:08': '(Laughter)', '01:11': 'The paper apologized, but said it never runs photos of women; they might be sexually provocative.', '01:16': '(Laughter)', '01:18': 'This is an extreme case, yes. But the fact is, women are only 19 percent of the sources in stories on politics, and only 20 percent in stories on the economy. The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories, except two: students and homemakers.', '01:39': '(Laughter)', '01:40': ""So we all get a very distorted picture of reality. The problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms. They report at just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio. Even in stories on gender-based violence, men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime."", '01:59': 'Case in point: This March, the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley about a gang rape of a young girl, 11 years old, in a small Texas town. McKinley writes that the community is wondering, ""How could their boys have been drawn into this?"" ""Drawn into this"" -- like they were seduced into committing an act of violence. And the first person he quotes says, ""These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives."" (Groans, laughter) You don\'t hear much about the 11-year-old victim, except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup.', '02:36': 'The Times was deluged with criticism. Initially, it defended itself, and said, ""These aren\'t our views. This is what we found in our reporting."" Now, here\'s a secret you probably know already: Your stories are constructed. As reporters, we research, we interview. We try to give a good picture of reality. We also have our own unconscious biases. But The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way. I disagree with that.', '03:05': ""So three weeks later, The Times revisits the story. This time, it adds another byline to it with McKinley's: Erica Goode. What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty. She was raped numerous times by many men. She had been a bright, easygoing girl. She was maturing quickly, physically, but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals. It's a very different picture. Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete."", '03:37': ""The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters. At KUNM here in Albuquerque, Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women. What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives. They tend to sensationalize, and they lack context. So for her graduate work, she did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women, found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa. She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources, their own internal biases and cultural norms. And she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally. She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female."", '04:27': ""Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men, and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts. Wired magazine, November 2010. Yes, the issue was about breast-tissue engineering. Now I know you're all distracted, so I'll take that off."", '04:47': '(Laughter)', '04:48': 'Eyes up here.', '04:50': '(Laughter)', '04:53': 'So --', '04:54': '(Applause)', '04:58': 'Here\'s the thing: Wired almost never puts women on its cover. Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones -- Pam from ""The Office,"" manga girls, a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds. Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology, reading Wired. Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired, defended his choice and said there aren\'t enough women, prominent women in technology to sell a cover, to sell an issue. Part of that is true, there aren\'t as many prominent women in technology.', '05:34': ""Here's my problem with that argument: Media tells us every day what's important, by the stories they choose and where they place them; it's called agenda setting. How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google before their faces were on a magazine cover? Putting them there made them more recognizable."", '05:52': 'Now, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea. This is its cover from November 15, 2010. The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology. Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute, ""Silicon Valley is very white and very male. But that\'s not what Fast Company thinks the business world will look like in the future, so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving.""', '06:17': 'By the way, apparently, Wired took all this to heart. This was its issue in April.', '06:22': '(Laughter)', '06:24': ""That's Limor Fried, the founder of Adafruit Industries, in the Rosie the Riveter pose."", '06:30': 'It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media. A recent global survey found that 73 percent of the top media-management jobs are still held by men. But this is also about something far more complex: our own unconscious biases and blind spots.', '06:46': 'Shankar Vedantam is the author of ""The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents, Control Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."" He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio, who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage, unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives. It\'s really difficult to disentangle those strands. But he did have one suggestion. He used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source. He balked at first, but said he eventually followed the directive happily, because his stories got better and his job got easier.', '07:24': ""Now, I don't know if one of the editors was a woman, but that can make the biggest difference. The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for a series it did on women around the world, but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor, and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground, particularly one on female genital mutilation -- men would just not be allowed into those situations."", '07:54': ""This is an important point to consider, because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue, such as Afghanistan. What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary. Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural, traditional areas, where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men."", '08:25': 'It\'s important to keep talking about this, in light of Lara Logan. She was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt\'s Tahrir Square, right after this photo was taken. Almost immediately, pundits weighed in, blaming her and saying things like, ""You know, maybe women shouldn\'t be sent to cover those stories."" I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew, who were attacked covering the same story.', '08:52': 'One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them. One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company, but she never thought about this as a career path, until she met female role models at JAWS.', '09:06': 'But this is not just a job for super-journalists or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media. Analyze your news. And speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage, like people at The New York Times did. Suggest female sources to reporters and editors. Remember -- a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.', '09:27': ""And I'll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in [1987] when I was a student in London. It's for The Guardian newspaper. It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist, but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world. Narrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture, you can fully understand what's going on."", '10:08': '[The Guardian]', '10:10': ""Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He shares amazing photos of some of the surprising finds of the Census of Marine Life.,0:16:32,16.53333333,339919,2012-02-28T17:13:41+00:00,"['biology', 'collaboration', 'fish', 'oceans', 'photography', 'marine biology', 'global commons']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Paul Snelgrove,Marine biologist,"{'00:04': ""The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet. And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet Planet Ocean. And the oceans are hugely productive, as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis, the production of new life. In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about. But I'll tell you some of that today. That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean. That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations."", '00:42': ""If you were to descend into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable, it would quickly become pitch black, interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms. And if you turn the lights on, you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by, because those are the denizens of the deep, the things that live in the deep ocean. And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view. This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat, despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies."", '01:19': ""And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. It involved 17 different projects around the world. As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects. And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve. It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel, met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute. And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it. Well, from that discussion grew this program that involved 2,700 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions at a combined cost of 650 million dollars to study the distribution, diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean."", '02:08': ""And so what did we find? We found spectacular new species, the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked -- from the shoreline to the abyss, form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between. And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life, but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step. They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves. There are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans. And as I say, it could be a much larger number."", '02:39': ""Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada -- It's an island off the east coast of that continent -- where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters in human history. And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish. It's around 1900. Now, when I was a boy of about his age, I would go out fishing with my grandfather and we would catch fish about half that size. And I thought that was the norm, because I had never seen fish like this. If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed, if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge, it would be half that size still. So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines. Our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes."", '03:21': ""Now most of us, and I would say me included, think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so. The census actually tried to look back in time, using every source of information they could get their hands on. And so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships' logs to see what the oceans looked like. Because science data really goes back to, at best, World War II, for the most part. And so what they found, in fact, is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans. And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration. So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. But the Romans developed salting. And with salting, it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. And so began industrial fishing."", '04:06': ""And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we've had relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean. They range from 65 to 98 percent for these major groups of organisms, as shown in the dark blue bars. Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect -- for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds -- there is some recovery. So it's not all hopeless. But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting."", '04:32': ""Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one. It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida. And so this is a photograph from the 1950s. I want you to notice the scale on the slide, because when you see the same picture from the 1980s, we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish. By 2007, the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. But this is no laughing matter. The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it."", '05:01': 'So what\'s left? Actually quite a lot. There\'s a lot of exciting things, and I\'m going to tell you a little bit about them. And I want to start with a bit on technology, because, of course, this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles. So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they\'re our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom. So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and I couldn\'t go because of a scheduling conflict. But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand, and I could tell the pilot, ""I want a sample right there."" And that\'s exactly what the pilot did for me. That\'s the sort of technology that\'s available today that really wasn\'t available even a decade ago. So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light.', '05:49': ""And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics, or sound waves. And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light. And so we can send out sound waves, they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back. And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships. One would send out sound waves that would bounce back. They would be received by a second ship, and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case, of 250 billion herring in a period of about a minute. And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island. And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool, because knowing how many fish are there is really critical."", '06:25': ""We can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans. And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe, such as this elephant seal, it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean. And so from that we can produce these tracks. For example, the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific. Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful, but stick with me nonetheless."", '06:49': ""For animals that don't surface, we have something called pop-up tags, which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. And then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore. Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools. And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways, these hot spots in the ocean, that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation."", '07:13': ""Now one of the other things that you may think about is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned. And so there's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is. Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding. And what barcoding does is use a specific gene called CO1 that's consistent within a species, but varies among species. And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other, but may be biologically quite different."", '07:41': ""Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City, who worked with the census. They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it. Well what they found was mislabeled fish. So for example, they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable, was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish. They also found an endangered species sold as a common one. So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with and also what we're eating."", '08:11': ""The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data. It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish. And it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute. And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand. This is where our sampling effort has concentrated. Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic, in the North Sea in particular, and also the east coast of North America fairly well. That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region. The cold colors, the blue and the black, show areas where we have almost no data. So even after a 10-year census, there are large areas that still remain unexplored."", '08:53': ""Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. And so they put this together, a list of all the species, where they're known to occur, and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise. But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill. So all of a sudden, this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved."", '09:31': ""So what did we find? Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that. But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity? Where do we find the most species of ocean life? And what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution. And what we see is that for coastal tags, for those organisms that live near the shoreline, they're most diverse in the tropics. This is something we've actually known for a while, so it's not a real breakthrough."", '09:59': ""What is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast, are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes. This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale. And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable."", '10:17': ""Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see, that certainly wasn't always the case. For example, while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists, it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science. Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species. Even though it's three meters long, it actually, again, eluded science. Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length. But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so it was a lot harder to find. But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things. This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp, it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was, until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia. And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness, can hide secrets for a very long time. So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out."", '11:15': ""If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically. And so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from New Zealand all the way up to Alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles. We also talked about the White Shark Cafe. This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge. We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know. That's a question for the future."", '11:41': ""One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive. Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic. But it was only discovered in the early 1980s. But the really interesting thing about it is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. So now they know that, in fact, animals can live without oxygen, at least some of them, and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions."", '12:09': ""If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean, this is what you'd be left behind with, and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor. Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between. We found life in the extremes. And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice-based food web."", '12:30': ""And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. And this particular species really captured the public's attention. We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters -- the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius -- vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable."", '12:53': ""Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many. And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you. First of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea? We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals. And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover. And from that, we actually calculate that we know about 16,500 marine species and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go. So we've done pretty well. We've got about 75 percent of the fish, maybe as much as 90 percent. But the fishes, as I say, are the best known."", '13:28': ""So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms. Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. And what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean. And what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean. That means 91 percent, even after the census, still remain to be discovered. And so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done. So we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns."", '13:57': ""Now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile. And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye. But you can imagine the biomass that represents. But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are. A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes. And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there? We actually don't know."", '14:28': ""The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census is the role of global science. And so as we see in this image of light during the night, there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less, but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean. The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected. Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries; they move where they will. And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important."", '14:58': ""We've lost a lot of paradise. For example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea are now effectively gone. There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean, which collected more garbage than they did animals. And that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on Earth. And there are a lot of other pressures. Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with, as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes, we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs."", '15:28': ""And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited, going through this litany of concerns about the ocean, but I want to end on a more positive note. And so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left, because there is still spectacular beauty. And the oceans are so productive, there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective, try to do better than we have in the past. So we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them."", '15:55': ""When we look at pictures like this, they take our breath away, in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide. Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold, they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery, the still vast unknown, the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile, whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh, the oceans matter. And as the oceans go so shall we."", '16:25': 'Thanks for listening.', '16:27': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She dropped her cell phone into the toilet. Anyone here done that before?', '00:20': '(Laughter)', '00:22': ""So it was a bad situation. You know, without getting into the details of exactly how that happened or how she got it out, let's just say it was a bad situation. And she panicked because, like for many of us, her phone is one of the most used and essential tools in her life. But, on the other hand, she had no idea how to fix it, because it's a completely mysterious black box."", '00:45': ""So think about it: what would you do? What do you really understand about how your phone works? What are you willing to test or fix? For most people, the answer is, nothing. In fact, one survey found that almost 80 percent of smartphone users in this country have never even replaced their phone batteries, and 25 percent didn't even know this was possible."", '01:12': ""Now, I'm an experimental physicist, hence the toys. I specialize in making new types of nanoscale electronic devices to study their fundamental quantum mechanical properties. But even I wouldn't know where to start in terms of testing elements on my phone if it broke. And phones are just one example of the many devices that we depend upon but can't test, take apart, or even fully understand. Cars, electronics, even toys are now so complicated and advanced that we're scared to open and fix them."", '01:49': ""So here's the problem: there's a disconnect between us and the technology that we use. We're completely alienated from the devices that we most depend upon, which can make us feel helpless and empty. In fact, it's not surprising then that one study found that we are now more afraid of technology than we are of death."", '02:15': '(Laughter)', '02:18': ""But I think that we can reconnect to our devices, rehumanize them in a sense, by doing more hands-on experiments. Why? Well, because an experiment is a procedure to test a hypothesis, demonstrate a fact. It's the way that we use our senses, our hands, to connect the world and figure out how it works. And that's the connection that we're missing."", '02:48': ""So let me give you an example. Here's an experiment that I did recently to think about how a touchscreen works. It's just two metal plates, and I can put charge on one of the plates from a battery. OK. And I can measure the charge separation with this voltmeter here. Now -- let's make sure it's working. So when I wave my hand near the plates, you can see that the voltage changes just like the touchscreen responds to my hand."", '03:19': ""But what is it about my hand? Now I need to do more experiments. So I can, say, take a piece of wood and touch one of the plates and see that not much happens, but if I take a piece of metal and touch the plate, then the voltage changes dramatically. So now I can do further experiments to see what the difference is between the wood and the metal, and I should find out that the wood is not conducting but the metal is conducting like my hand. And, you see, I build up my understanding. Like, now I can see why I can't use a touchscreen with gloves, because gloves aren't conducting. But I've also broken down some of the mystery behind the technology and built up my agency, my personal input and interactions with the basis of my devices."", '04:06': ""But experimenting is a step beyond just taking things apart. It's testing and doing hands-on critical thinking. And it doesn't really matter whether I'm testing how a touchscreen works or if I'm measuring how conducting different types of materials are, or even if I'm just using my hands to see how hard it is to break different thicknesses of materials. In all cases, I'm gaining control and understanding of the basis of the things that I use."", '04:33': ""And there's research behind this. For one, I'm using my hands, which seem to promote well-being. I'm also engaging in hands-on learning, which has been shown to improve understanding and retention, and even activate more parts of your brain. So hands-on thinking through experiments connects our understanding, even our sense of vitality, to the physical world and the things that we use. Looking things up on the internet does not have the same effect."", '05:07': ""Now, for me this focus on experiments is also personal. I didn't grow up doing experiments. I didn't know what a physicist did. I remember my sister had a chemistry set that I always wanted to use but she never let me touch. I felt mentally disconnected from the world and didn't know why. In fact, when I was nine years old, my grandmother called me a solipsist, which is something I had to look up. It means that you think that yourself is all that exists. And at the time I was pretty offended, because whose grandmother calls them that?"", '05:41': '(Laughter)', '05:44': ""But I think that it was true. And it wasn't until years later, when I was in college and studying basic physics, that I had a revelation that the world, at least the physical world, could be tested and understood, that I started to gain a completely different sense of how the world worked and what my place was in it. And then later, when I was able my own testing and understanding through research, a big part of my connection to the world was complete."", '06:14': 'Now, I know that not everyone is an experimental physicist by profession, but I think that everyone could be doing more hands-on experiments.', '06:24': 'And actually I think we sort of -- I\'ll give you another example. I was recently working with some middle school students, helping them learn about magnetism, and I gave them a Magna Doodle to take apart. Remember one of these things? So at first, none of them wanted to touch it. They\'d been told for so long not to break things that they\'re accustomed to just passive using. But then I started asking them questions. You know, how does it work? What parts are magnetic? Can you make a hypothesis and test it? But they still didn\'t want to break it open. They wanted to take it home with them, really. Until, one kid finally sliced it through and found really cool stuff inside. And so this is something we can do here together. They\'re pretty easy to take apart. See, there\'s a magnet inside, and I can just cut this open. Cut it open again, you can split it. OK, so when I do that -- I don\'t know if you can see this, but there is sort of -- there it is, this oozy white stuff in here. Now you can see it on my finger. And when I drag the pen on it, you can see that these filaments are attached to it. So the kids saw this, and at this point they\'re like, this is really cool. They got excited. They all started ripping them open and taking them apart and yelling out the things that they discovered, how these magnetic filaments connected to the magnetic pen and that\'s how it wrote. Or, how the oozy white stuff kept things dispersed so it could write. And as they were leaving the room, two of them turned to me and said, ""We loved that. Me and her are going home this weekend to do more experiments.""', '08:18': '(Laughter)', '08:24': ""Yeah, I know, the parents in there are worried about it, but it's a good thing! Experimenting is good, and actually I found it extremely gratifying, and I think hopefully it was very life-enriching for them. Because, even a basic magnet is something that we can experiment with at home. They're both simple and complex at the same time. For example, you can ask yourself, how can the same material both attract and repel? If I take a magnet, is it useful if I can get one of them to rotate the other, for example? Or, you can take this dollar bill over here, and I can take a set of magnets, and you can see that the dollar bill gets lifted by the magnets. There's magnetic ink hidden in here that prevents counterfeiting. Or, here I have some crushed-up bran cereal. OK? And that's also magnetic. Right? That has iron in it."", '09:21': '(Laughter)', '09:23': ""And that can be good for you, right? OK, here's something else. This thing over here is not magnetic. I can't lift it up with the magnet. But now I'm going to make it cold. The same thing in here, cold, and when I make it cold, and put it on top of the magnet, so --"", '09:48': '(Applause)', '09:49': ""It's amazing."", '09:55': ""That's not magnetic, but somehow it's interacting with a magnet. So clearly understanding this is going to take many more experiments. In fact, this is something that I've spent much of my career studying. It's called a superconductor."", '10:09': ""Now, superconductors can be complex, but even simple experiments can connect us better to the world. So now if I tell you that flash memory works by rotating small magnets, then you can imagine it. You've seen it. Or, if I say that MRI machines use magnetism to rotate magnetic particles in your body, you've seen it done. You've interacted with the technology and understood the basis of these devices."", '10:43': ""Now, I know that it's hard to add more things to our lives, especially experiments. But I think that the challenge is worth it. Think about how something works, then take it apart to test it. Manipulate something and prove some physical principle to yourself. Put the human back in the technology. You'll be surprised at the connections that you make."", '11:10': 'Thank you.', '11:12': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the Vikings also scratched runes into household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes.', '01:05': 'Deciphering these messages is no easy task. Runes are short, straight, and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet called the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote this language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds of their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore the influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,” for example, is originally a Latin phrase from the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, were carved in verse, highlighting the tradition of Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists can read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining mysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories have been deciphered— along with some containing magical incantations.', '02:02': 'The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground.

The stones announce the power of this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical documents of Denmark.

Norse poetry tells of runic spells, cast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords, axes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be incantations, riddles, or religious messages.', '03:46': 'While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end of the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion had mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak versions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas into the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing at their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup stone has fearsomely declared for a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone or drags it in memory of another!”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_hudspeth_the_beautiful_mysterious_science_of_how_you_hear,"The beautiful, mysterious science of how you hear","Have you ever wondered how your ears work? In this delightful and fascinating talk, biophysicist Jim Hudspeth demonstrates the wonderfully simple yet astonishingly powerful mechanics of hair cells, the microscopic powerhouses that make hearing possible -- and explains how, when it's really quiet, your ears will begin to beam out a spectrum of sounds unique to you.",0:15:35,15.58333333,337402,2020-03-13T14:57:05+00:00,"['science', 'biology', 'neuroscience', 'physics', 'Senses', 'human body', 'hearing']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Tiếng Việt', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語']",Jim Hudspeth,"Biophysicist, neuroscientist","{'00:12': 'Can you hear me OK?', '00:13': 'Audience: Yes.', '00:15': 'Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can, it\'s really amazing, because my voice is changing the air pressure where you sit by just a few billionths of the atmospheric level, yet we take it for granted that your ears can capture that infinitesimal signal and use it to signal to the brain the full range of auditory experiences: the human voice, music, the natural world. How does your ear do that? And the answer to that is: through the cells that are the real hero of this presentation -- the ear\'s sensory receptors, which are called ""hair cells.""', '00:51': ""Now, these hair cells are unfortunately named, because they have nothing at all to do with the kind of hair of which I have less and less. These cells were originally named that by early microscopists, who noticed that emanating from one end of the cell was a little cluster of bristles. With modern electron microscopy, we can see much better the nature of the special feature that gives the hair cell its name. That's the hair bundle. It's this cluster of 20 to several hundred fine cylindrical rods that stand upright at the top end of the cell. And this apparatus is what is responsible for your hearing me right this instant."", '01:35': ""Now, I must say that I am somewhat in love with these cells. I've spent 45 years in their company --"", '01:41': '(Laughter)', '01:42': ""and part of the reason is that they're really beautiful. There's an aesthetic component to it. Here, for example, are the cells with which an ordinary chicken conducts its hearing. These are the cells that a bat uses for its sonar. We use these large hair cells from a frog for many of our experiments. Hair cells are found all the way down to the most primitive of fishes, and those of reptiles often have this really beautiful, almost crystalline, order."", '02:10': ""But above and beyond its beauty, the hair bundle is an antenna. It's a machine for converting sound vibrations into electrical responses that the brain can then interpret. At the top of each hair bundle, as you can see in this image, there's a fine filament connecting each of the little hairs, the stereocilia. It's here marked with a little red triangle. And this filament has at its base a couple of ion channels, which are proteins that span the membrane."", '02:42': ""And here's how it works. This rat trap represents an ion channel. It has a pore that passes potassium ions and calcium ions. It has a little molecular gate that can be open, or it can be closed. And its status is set by this elastic band which represents that protein filament. Now, imagine that this arm represents one stereocilium and this arm represents the adjacent, shorter one with the elastic band between them. When sound energy impinges upon the hair bundle, it pushes it in the direction towards its taller edge. The sliding of the stereocilia puts tension in the link until the channels open and ions rush into the cell. When the hair bundle is pushed in the opposite direction, the channels close. And, most importantly, a back-and-forth motion of the hair bundle, as ensues during the application of acoustic waves, alternately opens and closes the channel, and each opening admits millions and millions of ions into the cell. Those ions constitute an electrical current that excites the cell. The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber, and then propagates into the brain. Notice that the intensity of the sound is represented by the magnitude of this response. A louder sound pushes the hair bundle farther, opens the channel longer, lets more ions in and gives rise to a bigger response."", '04:10': ""Now, this mode of operation has the advantage of great speed. Some of our senses, such as vision, use chemical reactions that take time. And as a consequence of that, if I show you a series of pictures at intervals of 20 or 30 per second, you get the sense of a continuous image. Because it doesn't use reactions, the hair cell is fully 1,000 times faster than our other senses. We can hear sounds at frequencies as great as 20,000 cycles per second, and some animals have ever faster ears. The ears of bats and whales, for example, can respond to their sonar pulses at 150,000 cycles a second."", '04:51': 'But this speed doesn\'t entirely explain why the ear performs so well. And it turns out that our hearing benefits from an amplifier, something called the ""active process."" The active process enhances our hearing and makes possible all the remarkable features that I\'ve already mentioned.', '05:12': ""Let me tell you how it works. First of all, the active process amplifies sound, so you can hear, at threshold, sounds that move the hair bundle by a distance of only about three-tenths of a nanometer. That's the diameter of one water molecule. It's really astonishing. The system can also operate over an enormously wide dynamic range. Why do we need this amplification? The amplification, in ancient times, was useful because it was valuable for us to hear the tiger before the tiger could hear us. And these days, it's essential as a distant early warning system. It's valuable to be able to hear fire alarms or contemporary dangerous such as speeding fire engines or police cars or the like. When the amplification fails, our hearing's sensitivity plummets, and an individual may then need an electronic hearing aid to supplant the damaged biological one."", '06:17': 'This active process also enhances our frequency selectivity. Even an untrained individual can distinguish two tones that differ by only two-tenths of a percent, which is one-thirtieth of the difference between two piano notes, and a trained musician can do even better. This fine discrimination is useful in our ability to distinguish different voices and to understand the nuances of speech. And, again, if the active process deteriorates, it becomes harder to carry out verbal communication.', '06:48': ""Finally, the active process is valuable in setting the very broad range of sound intensities that our ears can tolerate, from the very faintest sound that you can hear, such as a dropped pen, to the loudest sound that you can stand -- say, a jackhammer or a jet plane. The amplitude of sounds spans a range of one millionfold, which is more than is encompassed by any other sense or by any man-made device of which I'm aware. And again, if this system deteriorates, an affected individual may have a hard time hearing the very faintest sounds or tolerating the very loudest ones."", '07:27': ""Now, to understand how the hair cell does its thing, one has to situate it within its environment within the ear. We learn in school that the organ of hearing is the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea. It's an organ about the size of a chickpea. It's embedded in the bone on either side of the skull. We also learn that an optical prism can separate white light into its constituent frequencies, which we see as distinct colors. In an analogous way, the cochlea acts as sort of an acoustic prism that splits apart complex sounds into their component frequencies. So when a piano is sounded, different notes blend together into a chord."", '08:11': 'The cochlea undoes that process. It separates them and represents each at a different position. In this picture, you can see where three notes -- middle C and the two extreme notes on a piano -- are represented in the cochlea. The lowest frequencies go all the way up to the top of the cochlea. The highest frequencies, down to 20,000 Hz, go all the way to the bottom of the cochlea, and every other frequency is represented somewhere in between. And, as this diagram shows, successive musical tones are represented a few tens of hair cells apart along the cochlear surface.', '08:46': 'Now, this separation of frequencies is really key in our ability to identify different sounds, because very musical instrument, every voice, emits a distinct constellation of tones. The cochlea separates those frequencies, and the 16,000 hair cells then report to the brain how much of each frequency is present. The brain can then compare all the nerve signals and decide what particular tone is being heard.', '09:15': ""But this doesn't explain everything that I want to explain. Where's the magic? I told you already about the great things that the hair cell can do. How does it carry out the active process and do all the remarkable features that I mentioned at the outset? The answer is instability. We used to think that the hair bundle was a passive object, it just sat there, except when it was stimulated. But in fact, it's an active machine. It's constantly using internal energy to do mechanical work and enhance our hearing. So even at rest, in the absence of any input, an active hair bundle is constantly trembling. It's constantly twitching back and forth. But when even a weak sound is applied to it, it latches on to that sound and begins to move very neatly in a one-to-one way with it, and by so doing, it amplifies the signal about a thousand times."", '10:08': ""This same instability also enhances our frequency selectivity, for a given hair cell tends to oscillate best at the frequency at which it normally trembles when it's not being stimulated. So, this apparatus not only gives us our remarkably acute hearing, but also gives us the very sharp tuning."", '10:34': ""I want to offer you a short demonstration of something related to this. I'll ask the people who are running the sound system to turn up its sensitivity at one specific frequency. So just as a hair cell is tuned to one frequency, the amplifier will now enhance a particular frequency in my voice. Notice how specific tones emerge more clearly from the background. This is exactly what hair cells do. Each hair cell amplifies and reports one specific frequency and ignores all the others. And the whole set of hair cells, as a group, can then report to the brain exactly what frequencies are present in a given sound, and the brain can determine what melody is being heard or what speech is being intended."", '11:23': ""Now, an amplifier such as the public address system can also cause problems. If the amplification is turned up too far, it goes unstable and begins to howl or emit sounds. And one wonders why the active process doesn't do the same thing. Why don't our ears beam out sounds? And the answer is that they do. In a suitably quiet environment, 70 percent of normal people will have one or more sounds coming out of their ears."", '11:51': '(Laughter)', '11:52': ""I'll give you an example of this. You will hear two emissions at high frequencies coming from a normal human ear. You may also be able to discern background noise, like the microphone's hiss, the gurgling of a stomach, the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes."", '12:12': '(Hums, microphone hiss, dampened taps, clothes rustling)', '12:27': 'This is typical. Most ears emit just a handful of tones, but some can emit as many as 30. Every ear is unique, so my right ear is different from my left, my ear is different from your ear, but unless an ear is damaged, it continues to emit the same spectrum of frequencies over a period of years or even decades.', '12:46': ""So what's going on? It turns out that the ear can control its own sensitivity, its own amplification. So if you're in a very loud environment, like a sporting event or a musical concert, you don't need any amplification, and the system is turned down all the way. If you are in a room like this auditorium, you might have a little bit of amplification, but of course the public address system does most of the work for you. And finally, if you go into a really quiet room where you can hear a pin drop, the system is turned up almost all the way. But if you go into an ultraquiet room such as a sound chamber, the system turns itself up to 11, it goes unstable and it begins to emit sound. And these emissions constitute a really strong demonstration of just how active the hair cell can be."", '13:36': 'So in the last minute, I want to turn to another question that might come up, which is: Where do we go from here? And I would say that there are three issues that I would really like to address in the future.', '13:47': ""The first is: What is the molecular motor that's responsible for the hair cell's amplification? Somehow, nature has stumbled across a system that can oscillate or amplify at 20,000 cycles per second, or even more. That's much faster than any other biological oscillation, and we would like to understand where it comes from."", '14:10': ""The second issue is how the hair cell's amplification is adjusted to deal with the acoustic circumstances. Who turns the knob to increase or decrease the amplification in a quiet or in a loud environment?"", '14:24': ""And the third issue is one that concerns all of us, which is what we can do about the deterioration of our hearing. Thirty million Americans, and more than 400 million people worldwide, have significant problems on a daily basis with understanding speech in a noisy environment or over the telephone. Many have even worse deficits. Moreover, these deficits tend to get worse with time, because when human hair cells die, they're not replaced by cell division. But we know that nonmammalian animals can replace their cells, and those creatures' cells are dying and being replaced throughout life, so the animals maintain normal hearing. Here's an example from a little zebra fish. The cell at the top will undergo a division to produce two new hair cells. They dance for a little bit, and then settle down and go to work."", '15:16': ""So we believe that if we can decode the molecular signals that are used by these other animals to regenerate their hair cells, we'll be able to do the same thing for humans. And our group and many other groups are now engaged in research trying to resurrect these amazing hair cells."", '15:33': 'Thank you for your attention.', '15:35': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_beck_small_rockets_are_the_next_space_revolution,Small rockets are the next space revolution,"We're in the dawn of a new space revolution, says engineer Peter Beck: the revolution of the small. In a talk packed with insights into the state of the space industry, Beck shares his work building rockets capable of delivering small payloads to space rapidly and reliably -- helping us search for extraterrestrial life, learn more about the solar system and create a global internet network.",0:11:24,11.4,337047,2019-11-12T16:08:48+00:00,"['3D printing', 'space', 'science', 'technology', 'exploration', 'entrepreneur']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Magyar', 'Русский']",Peter Beck,Rocket entrepreneur,"{'00:10': ""So what I'm going to talk about here is, this is a power station. So if you've ever wondered what a couple of million horsepower looked like, that's pretty much what it looks like. And for me, it's always been about the rocket. In fact so much so that when I was growing up, the school called in my parents to have a bit of a discussion, because they believed that my aspirations were unrealistic for what I wanted to do."", '00:34': '(Laughter)', '00:35': 'And they suggested that I take up a job at the local aluminium smelter, because I was very good with my hands. But for me, aluminium, or as you Canadians say, ""aluminum,"" was not part of my plan at all. So I started building rockets when I was at school. They got bigger and bigger. I actually hold an unofficial land speed record for a rocket bike and roller blades while wearing a rocket pack.', '00:58': '(Laughter)', '00:59': ""But as the rockets got larger and larger, and more and more complex, I started to be able to think I could do something with this. Now today we hear about very large rockets taking humans to, or aspiring to take humans to, the Moon, and Mars and beyond. And that's really important, but there's a revolution going on in the space industry, and it's not a revolution of the big, it's a revolution of the small."", '01:23': ""So here we have an average-to-large-sized spacecraft in 1990. We can tell it's 1990 because of the powder blue smocks for all the trained in the clean rooms in 1990. But that was your average-to-large-sized spacecraft in 1990. Here's a spacecraft that's going to launch this year. This particular spacecraft has four high-resolution cameras, a whole lot of senors, a CoMP communication system. We're going to launch thousands of these into the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life. Quite different."", '01:52': ""You see that Moore's law really applied itself to spacecraft. However, the rockets that we've been building have been designed for carrying these very large, school-bus-sized spacecraft to orbit. But this kind of launch vehicle here is not very practical for launching something that will fit on the tip of my finger. And to give you a sense of scale here, this rocket is so large that I inserted a picture of myself in my underpants, in complete confidence, knowing that you will not be able to find me. That's how big this rocket actually is."", '02:21': '(Laughter)', '02:23': 'Moving on.', '02:24': '(Laughter)', '02:26': ""So this is our rocket -- it's called the Electron. It's a small launch vehicle for lifting these small payloads into orbit. And the key here is not the size of the rocket -- the key here is frequency. If you actually wanted to democratize space and enable access to space, launch frequency is the absolute most important thing out of all of this."", '02:46': ""Now in order to really democratize space, there's three things you have to do. And each one of these three things has kind of the equivalent amount of work. So the first is, obviously, you have to build a rocket. The second is regulatory, and the third is infrastructure."", '03:02': ""So let's talk a little bit about infrastructure. So this is our launch site -- it's obviously not Cape Canaveral, but it's a little launch site -- in fact, it's the only private orbiter launch site in the entire world, down in New Zealand. And you may think that's a bit of an odd place to build a rocket company and a launch site. But the thing is that every time you launch a rocket, you have to close down around about 2,000 kilometers of airspace, 2,000 kilometers of marine and shipping space, and ironically, it's one of the things in America that doesn't scale very well, because every time you close down all that airspace, you disrupt all these travelers trying to get to their destination. The airlines really hate rocket companies, because it costs them around $70,000 a minute, and so on. So what you really need, if you want to truly have rapid access to space, is a reliable and frequent access to space, is you need, basically, a small island nation in the middle of nowhere, with no neighbors and no air traffic. And that just happened to be New Zealand."", '03:57': '(Laughter)', '03:59': ""So, that's kind of the infrastructure bit."", '04:02': ""Now the next bit of that is regulatory. So, believe it or not, New Zealand is not known for its space prowess, or at least it wasn't. And you can't just rock on up to a country with what is essentially considered an ICBM, because unfortunately, if you can put a satellite into orbit, you can use that rocket for doing significantly nasty things. So quickly, you run afoul of a whole lot of rules and regulations, and international treaties of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and whatnot. So it becomes quite complex. So in order for us to launch down in New Zealand, we had to get the United States government and the New Zealand government to agree to sign a bilateral treaty. And then once that bilateral treaty was signed to safeguard the technology, the New Zealand government had a whole lot of obligations. And they had to create a lot of rules and regulations. In fact, they had to pass laws through a select committee and through Parliament, ultimately, and to complete laws. Once you have laws, you need somebody who administers them. So they had to create a space agency. And once they did, the Aussies felt left out, so they had to create a space agency. And on and on it goes."", '05:08': ""So you see, there's a massive portion of this, in fact, two thirds of it, that does not even involve the rocket."", '05:14': '(Laughter)', '05:15': ""Now, let's talk about the rocket. You know, what I didn't say is that we're actually licensed to launch every 72 hours for the next 30 years. So we have more launch availability as a private company than America does as an entire country. And if you've got a launch every 72 hours, then that means you have to build a rocket every 72 hours. And unfortunately, there's no such thing as just a one-stop rocket shop. You can't go and buy bits to build a rocket. Every rocket is absolutely bespoke, every component is absolutely bespoke. And you're in a constant battle with physics every day. Every single day, I wake up and I battle physics."", '05:52': ""And I'll give you an example of this. So on the side of our rocket, there's a silver stripe. The reason is because there's avionic components behind there. We needed to lower the emissivity of the skin so we didn't cook the components from the sunlight. So we paint a silver stripe. Unfortunately, as you're sailing through the Earth's atmosphere, you generate a lot of static electricity. And if you don't have conductive paint, you'll basically send lightning bolts down to the Earth. So even the silver paint has to be triboelectrificated and certified and applied and everything, and the stickers, they're a whole nother story. But even the simplest thing is always, always a real struggle."", '06:31': ""Now, to the heart of any launch vehicle is the engine. This is our Rutherford rocket engine. And usually, you measure rocket engines in terms of time to manufacture, in terms of sort of months or even sometimes years, on really big engines. But if you're launching every 72 hours -- there's 10 engines per rocket -- then you need to produce an engine very quickly. We needed to come up with a whole new process and a whole new cycle for the rocket engine. We came up with a new cycle called the electric turbo pump, but we also managed to be able to 3D-print these rocket engines. So each one of these engines is 3D-printed out of Inconel superalloy, and right now, we can print round about one engine every 24 hours."", '07:11': 'Now, the electric turbo pump cycle is a totally different way to pump propellant into the rocket engine. So we carry about one megawatt where the battery is on board. And we have little electric turbo pumps, about the size of a Coke can, not much bigger than a Coke can. They spin at 42,000 RPM, and each one of those Coke-can-sized turbo pumps produces about the same amount of horsepower as your average family car, and we have 20 of them on the rocket. So you can see even the simplest thing, like pumping propellants, always pretty much drives you insane.', '07:42': 'This is Electron, it works.', '07:45': '(Laughter)', '07:46': '(Applause)', '07:52': ""Not only does it work once, it seems to work quite frequently, which is handy when you've got a lot of customers to put on orbit. So far, we've put 25 satellites in orbit. And the really cool thing is we're able to do it very, very accurately. In fact, we insert the satellites to within an accuracy of 1.4 kilometers. And I guess if you're riding in a cab, 1.4 kilometers is not very accurate. But in, kind of, space terms, that equates to around about 180 milliseconds. We travel 1.4 kilometers in about 180 milliseconds. So, it's actually quite hard to do."", '08:23': '(Laughter)', '08:24': ""Now, what I want to talk about here is space junk. We've talked a lot during this talk about, you know, how we want to launch really frequently, every 72 hours, and all the rest of it. However, I don't want to go down in history as the guy that put the most amount of space junk in orbit. This is kind of the industry's dirty little secret here, what most people don't realize is that the majority of space junk by mass is not actually satellites, it's dead rockets. Because as you ascend to orbit, you have to shed bits of the rocket to get there, with the battle of physics. So I'm going to give a little Orbital Mechanics 101 here, and talk about how we go to orbit, and how we do it really, really differently from everybody else."", '09:04': ""So the second stage cruises along and then we separate off a thing at the top called the kick stage, but we leave the second stage in this highly elliptical orbit. And at the perigee of the orbit, or the lowest point, it dips into the Earth's atmosphere and basically burns back up. So now we're left with this little kick stage, that white thing on the corner of the screen. It's got its own propulsion system, and we use it to raise and trim the orbit and then deploy the spacecraft. And then because it's got its own engine, we put it into a retro orbit, put it back into a highly elliptical orbit, reenter it into the atmosphere and burn it back up, and leave absolutely nothing behind. Now everybody else in the industry is just downright filthy, they just leave their crap everywhere out there."", '09:44': '(Laughter)', '09:45': '(Applause)', '09:50': ""So I want to tell you a little bit of a story, and this is going to date me, but I went to a school at the very bottom of the South Island in New Zealand, tiny little school, and we had a computer not dissimilar to this one. And attached to that computer was a little black box called a modem, and every Friday, the class would gather around the computer and we would send an email to another school in America that was lucky enough to have the same kind of setup, and we would receive an email back. And we thought that was just incredible, absolutely incredible. Now I often wonder what would happen if I traveled back in time and I sat down with myself and I explained all of the things that were going to occur because of that little black box connected to the computer. You would largely think that it would be complete fantasy. But the reality is that is where we are right now with space. We're right on the verge of democratizing space, and we have essentially sent our first email to space."", '10:41': ""Now I'll give you some examples. So last year, we flew a small satellite for a bunch of high school students who had built it. And the high school students were studying the atmosphere of Venus. Those are high school students launching their own satellite. Another great example, there's a number of really big programs right now to place large constellations, of small satellites in orbit to deliver internet to every square millimeter on the planet. And for pretty much everybody in this room, that's just handy, because we can stream Netflix anywhere we want. But if you think about the developing countries of the world, you've just disseminated the entire knowledge of the world to every single person in the world. And that's going to have a pretty major effect."", '11:22': 'Thanks very much.', '11:24': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's awful, right? In fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes. When they fly into our bedroom at night, they prefer to bite my wife."", '00:48': '(Laughter)', '00:49': ""But that's fascinating, right? Why does she receive more bites than I do? And the answer is smell, the smell of her body. And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitoes, some of us are just more attractive than others. So my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does."", '01:16': ""Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us. And during my PhD, I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin African malaria mosquitoes use to track us down at night. And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use. And this was not going to be an easy task. And therefore we set up various experiments. Why did we set up these experiments? Because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite. Every 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet, a child dies of malaria, and Paul Levy this morning, he was talking about the metaphor of the 727 crashing into the United States. Well, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s crashing every day. But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps, bait it with our smell, we may be able to stop transmission of disease."", '02:20': 'Now, solving this puzzle was not an easy thing, because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin, but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed.', '02:32': 'First, we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body. Strange. So we set up an experiment where we put a naked volunteer in a large cage,', '02:44': '(Laughter)', '02:45': ""and in that cage, we released mosquitoes to see where they were biting on the body of that person. And we found some remarkable differences. On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person. They had a very strong preference for biting on the face. In contrast, the African malaria mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person. And that, of course, we should have known all along, because they're called mosqui-toes, you see?"", '03:15': '(Laughter)', '03:17': ""That's right."", '03:18': '(Applause)', '03:20': ""And so we started focusing on the smell of feet ... on the smell of human feet, until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse. Think of it. And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment. We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese, which smells badly after feet, to attract African malaria mosquitoes. And you know what? It worked. In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans. Limburg, be proud of your cheese, as it is now used in the fight against malaria."", '04:15': '(Applause)', '04:22': ""That's the cheese, just to show you."", '04:25': ""My second story is remarkable as well. It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs. And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria. One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease. It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae. Why? Because they are just like the CIA. In that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated. They're all together there. They are immobile. They can't escape from that water. They can't fly. And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right?"", '05:12': 'So the problem that we face with this is that, throughout the landscape, all these pools of water with the larvae, they are scattered all over the place, which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides. And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized that just like us -- we have a unique smell -- mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.', '05:42': ""And so we set up another crazy experiment, because we collected the smell of these larvae, put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable. Here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole. Oh, that was very quick. And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. He's examining these holes and now he's got it already. He's going back to check the control holes again, but he's coming back to the first one, and now he's locking into that smell, which means that now, we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field, and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria. This lady is Ellen van der Zweep. She's one of the best dog trainers in the world, and she believes that we can do a lot more. Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected, she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite. That means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way and there's few people remaining with parasites, that the dogs can find these people, we can treat them with antimalarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria. Man's best friend in the fight against malaria."", '06:54': 'My third story is perhaps even more remarkable ... and, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.', '07:01': '(Audience cheers)', '07:02': ""Yeah. It's a crazy story, but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitoes ever. In fact, people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes. And the question of course is, what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes? And the answer I have right here ... in my pocket --"", '07:27': '(Laughter)', '07:28': ""if I get it. It's a tablet. A simple tablet, and when I take it with water ... it does miracles. Thank you."", '07:48': 'Now, let me show you how this works. Here in this box, I have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes ...', '08:03': '(Laughter)', '08:04': ""that I'm just about to release."", '08:07': '(Laughter)', '08:09': 'Just kidding, just kidding.', '08:10': '(Laughter)', '08:11': ""What I'm going to show you is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. There we go. Don't worry, I do this all the time in the lab. There we go. OK. Now, on the video -- on the video here, I'm going to show you exactly the same thing, except that what I'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet. Have a look. That doesn't work. OK. Sorry about that. I'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal, I'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time to see these mosquitoes get very, very sick indeed, here shown in fast motion. And three hours later, what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes ... very dead mosquitoes. And I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen, we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes. They don't kill us. We kill them."", '09:10': '(Applause)', '09:20': 'Now --', '09:22': '(Laughter) Maastricht, be prepared. Now, think of what we can do with this. We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right? And better still, imagine what would happen if, in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs, for just three weeks. That would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease.', '09:46': ""So cheese, dogs and a pill to kill mosquitoes. That's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing ... for the betterment of mankind, but especially for her, so that she can grow up in a world without malaria."", '10:02': 'Thank you.', '10:03': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this hilarious talk, Kate Wagner, creator of the blog McMansion Hell, roasts a few of these architectural eyesores, and discusses how builders and homebuyers can make better design choices with an eye to both sustainability and aesthetics.",,,334255,2018-09-04T16:01:44+00:00,"['art', 'architecture', 'design', 'urban planning', 'education']","['English', 'Polski', 'Português de Portugal']",Kate Wagner,Author of McMansionHell,"{'0:00': 'First of all, I\'d like to apologize to anyone in the room who considers themselves to be architecturally sensitive. What you\'re about to see may upset you. So, the number one question I get in my inbox all the time is, so McMansion hell, what the hell is McMansion? So, it\'s pretty easy. I\'ve narrowed it down to a couple of factors. First of all, they are oversized. That means there\'s over 3,000 square feet which is 500 feet more than the highest national housing average. So, AKA that space, as you can see here probably 26 children. (Laughter) And the other thing is, if you look at this house, which is quite lovely, (Laughter) I\'m sorry. This house probably has three media rooms, seven bathrooms with a garden tub, and a chandelier and whatever, but it doesn\'t have a front porch and I cannot find the front door. (Laughter) Also there\'s no lawn So, that leads to my second point, they are poorly designed. So, that means there\'s no respect for form or scale or other things that people in the architecture would call \'the basic rules of architecture.\' So, as you can see here, this house looks like it was designed by someone who maybe saw a house once in their life, but either had some sort of visual issues or was wearing kaleidoscope glasses that you get during Halloween. Even worse these poorly designed houses are cheaply constructed. So, I will get to that in a second. But, I\'d like to point out that this is an engineering marvel. This is a house that is a wood frame covered in different types of foam. (Laughter) So, and finally, they are disrespectful. (Laughter) So, you have to feel really bad for the poor folks in these little houses who on longer have any natural light in their homes. It is a dark time for them as it is for all of us. So, basically they are fundamentally bad architecture. Now, even though I\'m dressed impeccably well, I\'m not the gatekeeper of what is and is not good aesthetic architecture. But, we\'ve been talking about these things in architectural history for thousands of years starting with Vitruvius, the great-great-great -granddaddy of architecture. Sorry art history majors, this is going to be boring. So, Vitruvius said that architecture should be three things, right? It should be durable, it should be useful or functional, and it should be beautiful. And McMansions are well, you know, none of these things. So, let\'s start with durable. So, through most of human history houses were built to last generations, that means that you were born in the house, had kids in your house, died in your house, and then your kids had kids in your house and died in your house. AKA, they were permanent. That changed in the 1980s with access to cheaper construction methods and materials and also in deregulation economies, etc, causing a huge housing bubble, right? That we all know of. And basically these houses weren\'t built to last 15 years, because they were built to have the most amount of space for the lowest price, and people didn\'t really care about how long they\'d last anyway because they were going to live there for maybe six years, maybe less because they were going to flip that house and make, like, a million dollars. A million dollars. (Laughter) And they would be on the next house before you ever knew it, so it was not their problem anymore, but we all know how that ended. So that brings me to another part of durability- they are not aesthetically durable. That means that certain house designs like you know, you have the box, and the box has a roof and the roof looks like this, and this is the house that every child draws, this is your idea of the house. These houses, of course, as you can see in this case, this is a house that is got water damage, and the balconies don\'t lay anywhere, you can actually go out open those doors, you will fall into your yard. (Laughter) These were just trends. People saw stuff like this on TV and said, ""I want that on my house."" And so they\'re not really aesthetically durable because they were built on these trends, and when the trends ran out, they would be onto the third house or the fourth house because they were flipping and making millions of dollars. So, according to Bloomberg now, these houses aren\'t selling well. And houses that are smaller, you know, like normal people houses, built for normal people not giant cars to live in, are appreciating at a much higher and faster rate. And so we are gonna move on to useful. What does it mean for house to be useful? So there are primary uses for a house. One is to keep us, you know, out of the elements. Like you saw in the last example, it\'s not doing a good job of that with the water damage in the missing deck. Oh, speaking of the elements, imaging trying to heat and cool that house. So you can\'t even stay warm or cool without spending millions of dollars. (Laughter) But most of all, a house is suppose to be our home. It\'s a place for our sanctuary, community, and being one with our families. And in a space that is designed where everyone has their own room, and their own living room, and their own dining room, and their own pool table? You don\'t have to interact with any members of your family. So trust me I would have loved that in the seventh grade. But I think most of us are the well-adjusted people that we are, because we\'ve had to fight with our siblings in our parents, and all these things that come from living in a smaller-knit space. And when you rob that sense of community from our homes, what real purpose do they have? But McMansions ignore both of these purposes to focus on a new purpose, and that purpose was the house is an asset, the house was now becoming through series of, you know, deregulatory economic policies, etc, a liquid asset, it was money, it was no longer a place to live, and it was seperated from the sense of place and space that we know and consider our homes, and so beautiful. McMansions don\'t follow the rules of traditional architecture, but really love to use the icons and the symbols, and shapes of the traditional architecture like columns in windows styles, and the box with the roof, though the roof is three times as big as the box. And in this case, you can see none of the windows actually match. Some have muntains which is the bits that separate the panes of glass, and some don\'t, and most of all it looks like it is a screaming animal. (Laughter) So, there\'s no regard for basic matching, scale, you know, the rules of architecture, because they were designed mostly from the inside out, and mommy really needed her cathedral ceilings in the bathroom. You know sometimes that meant you had a roof on that looked like this. Okay what\'s the point, right? Why do I even care about McMansions if they are so horrible, and why do I write about them? Well, it\'s about education. 60 percent of people according to the U.S. census bureau live in the suburbs, and not all of us have access to the fabric of our cities that have buildings from different eras, and all their beautiful details, all interwoven into an urban fabric. Most of us have to live with, you know, McMansions. And so it\'s about teaching with what you have, and also they\'re politically charged. They\'re sort of the poster child of the recession, and they are attached to concepts like urbanism and sustainability and other things that make up a better world. You might be still asking, ""Okay, well, why not talk about you know good architecture?"" Well why so negative? I started writing about architecture in high school to defend buildings like this. This is the Goshen Government Centre by Paul Rudolph, in Goshen, New York which is undergoing, what I like to call \'a murder.\' (Laughter). I discovered, in the fight for preservation of late modernist and post-modernist architecture which is the part that I like, if you were on the side of ""I don\'t like this,"" you have the advantage. People say, ""Oh, I like this,"" and like, okay, but if you say, ""I don\'t like this,"" then like why? And if you don\'t know why you\'re pretty much a jerk - but that gets people talking and starts a disscusion and so in McMansion hell I saw this opportunity to explore, because a lof people hate McMansions but they have no idea why. They\'re like, ""I hate that, it\'s big and it\'s ugly!"", but they don\'t know what is so ugly about it or why it seems so big, and that\'s sort of where I come in, and it brings me to my final point. It\'s about the greater purpose. So my professor at Peabody where I study acoustics has this saying that says, ""The first step to good design is avoiding the bad, then you can design the good, and the first step to avoiding the bad is recognizing the bad."" It\'s about looking at the world through a critical eye, and the best part about being snarky is that you are automatically critical. And so people can say, avoiding the bad, right? You don\'t want a house thet looks like the ginormous thing that\'s on the screen here. This is literally the McMansion, it is a house that someone took to their little mouth and blew up into a balloon. It\'s like they took the nice house with the cable and (Puffs) Now if you know I don\'t like that, and here\'s why I don\'t like that then I can start thinking about encouraging other people and educating them about why I don\'t like that and they don\'t like that. And maybe through this sort of education and design, getting people who don\'t care about design to talk about design is another really huge step in perpetuating better design. And so through using America\'s ugliest and most hated houses, I mean, I\'m sorry. We can... (Laughter) In talking about them in a way that introduces humor so it\'s not, ""I\'m shoving my good design down your throat, dang you!"" We can encourage people through discussion, through education, through empowerment, to be a greater force for change, and a change towards a more beautiful, a more sustainable, a more inclusive, and you know, a better-looking world. (Laughter) Or at least, prevent them from building more McMansions. Thank you!

And this picture shows the city that I come from, Beijing, China. And old Beijing is like a very beautiful garden, you can see a lot of nature. When I was a kid, I learned to swim in this lake and I climbed mountains every day after school. But after getting older, we built more and more modern buildings. And they all look the same. They all look like matchboxes.', '00:39': ""Why are modern buildings and cities full of these boxy shapes? In this photo, you actually see two cities. The one on the left is New York, and the one on the right is Tianjin, a Chinese city that's being constructed. And they have very similar skylines. Maybe they also follow the same principle. You know, competing for density, competing for more space, competing for efficiency. Therefore, modern architecture becomes a symbol of capital and power."", '01:18': ""Chinese cities are building a lot, they're also, you know, not only competing for this space and height, they're also learning a lot from North American urban strategies [and] also repeat a lot from city to city. So here, we call it 1,000 cities with one face."", '01:39': 'So as an architect in China, I have to ask myself, what can I do about it? One day, I was walking on a street, I saw people selling fish. And they put the fish in this cubic fish tank. So I was asking the same question, why a cubic space for fish? Do they like cubic space?', '02:00': '(Laughter)', '02:01': ""Obviously not. So maybe the cubic space, cubic architecture, is cheaper, is easier to make. So, I did this small research, I put a camera and I tried to observe how fish behave in this cubic space. And then I found they probably weren't happy. The cubic space wasn't the perfect home for them, so I decided to design a new fish tank for them. I think it should be more organic, it should be a more fluid space inside. More complex interiors. I think they should feel happier living in this space, but I wouldn't know because they don't talk to me."", '02:50': '(Laughter)', '02:52': 'But one year after, we got this opportunity to design this real building for humans. This is actually a pair of towers that we built in Mississauga, a city outside Toronto. And people call this Marilyn Monroe Towers --', '03:10': '(Laughter)', '03:11': 'because of its curvature. And the idea was to build a tower, high-rise, residential tower, but not a box. It\'s more inspired by nature, with the sunshine and wind dynamics. After we finished designing the first tower, they told us, you know, ""You don\'t have to design the second one, you just repeat the same design, and we pay you twice."" But I said, ""You cannot have two Marilyn Monroes standing there."" And nature never repeats itself, so now we have two buildings that can dance together.', '04:01': ""So I have this question for myself. You know, why, in the modern city, we often think architecture is a machine, is a box? So here, I want to see how people looked at nature in the past. By looking into this Chinese traditional painting, I found that they often mixed the nature and the artificial, man-made, in a very dramatic way, so they create this emotional scenery. So in the modern city, my question is: Is there a way that we don't separate buildings and nature, but combine them?"", '04:43': ""So there's another project that we built in China. It's a quite large residential complex. And it's located in a very beautiful nature setting. To be honest, the first time when I visited the site, it was too beautiful. And I almost decided to reject the project because you feel as a criminal to do anything there. I don't want to become a criminal. But my second thought was, if I didn't do it, they would just put, you know, standard urban towers there, anyway. And that would be a pity. So I decided I had to give it a try."", '05:28': ""So the way we did that was we took the contour lines from the existing mountains, and we took those lines and then translated them into a building. So those towers are actually taking the shapes and geometries from the nature. So each building has a different shape, a different size, different height. And they become the extension of the nature [where] they're situated."", '05:53': 'And you know, people think we use computer sometimes to design this kind of architecture, but I actually use a lot of hand sketch, because I like the randomness in the hand sketch. And they can carry sort of emotions that cannot be made by computers.', '06:17': ""Architecture and humans and nature can coexist together and are having a good relationship in this photo. Actually this guy in the photo is one of the architects on our team. I think he's been enjoying the beautiful nature scenery, and feeling relieved that he is not part of the criminals --"", '06:42': '(Laughter)', '06:44': 'in the end.', '06:46': ""Back to the city, in Beijing, we were asked to design these urban towers. And I made this model. It's an architecture model, looks like a minimountain and minivalleys. I put this model on my table, and I watered it every day. And years later, we completed this building. And you can see how my hand sketch is being translated into the real building. And they look quite similar. It looks like a black mountain. And this is how this building is situated in the city. It's on the edge of this beautiful park. It's different, very different from the surrounding buildings, because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature. But what we're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature, so we can extend the nature from the park into the city. So that was the idea."", '07:50': ""A Chinese art critic drew this painting. He put our building in this painting. Can you see there's a black, tiny mountain? That looks very fit into this painting. However, in this reality, our design was being challenged that it looks so different from the surroundings. And they asked me to modify my design, either color or shape, to make the building fit the context better. So my question was, why it fits this traditional, you know, natural context, better than the reality? Maybe there's something wrong with the reality. Something wrong with the context."", '08:42': ""In the very northern part of China, we also built this opera house. It's an opera house next to the river, in the wetland park. So we decided to make this building part of the surrounding landscape and merge into the horizon. The building literally looks like a snow mountain. And people can walk on the building. During the day or when there's no opera, people come here, they can enjoy the views, and they can continue their journey from the park onto the building. When they reach the rooftop, there's an amphitheater that's framing the sky, where they can sing to the sky. Inside the opera, we have this lobby with a lot of natural light, and they can also enjoy this semi-indoor-outdoor space, and they can see the beautiful view around them."", '09:43': 'I\'ve been building several mountains, and here I\'m trying to show you one building that I think looks like a cloud. It\'s the Lucas Museum of Narrative Arts that\'s being constructed in the city of Los Angeles. It\'s a museum created by George Lucas, the creator of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Why a building that looks like a cloud? Because I think, I imagine, the cloud is mysterious. It\'s nature. It\'s surreal when this natural element landed in the city. And it makes you feel curious about it, and you want to explore it. So that\'s how the building landed on earth. By lifting this museum, making it float above the ground, we can free up a lot of landscape and space underneath the building. And then we can, at the same time, create this roof garden above the building where you can visit and enjoy the view. This museum will be completed in the year 2022, and you\'re all invited when it\'s completed.', '11:01': ""So after building all these mountains and clouds, now we're building these volcanoes back in China. This is actually a huge sports park with four stadiums in it, with one football stadium [with] 40,000 seats in there. So it's a very large project. And you see from this photo, you can hardly tell where there's building and where there's landscape. So the building becomes a landscape. Even becomes a land art, where people can walk around the building, they can climb this building as they're wandering in this volcano park. And this rendering shows one of the spaces in those volcanoes. This is actually a swimming pool with natural light coming from above."", '11:58': ""So, what we're trying to create actually is an environment that blurs the boundary in between architecture and nature. So architecture is no longer a functional machine for living. It also reflects the nature around us. It also reflects our soul and spirit. So, as an architect, I don't think in the future we should repeat those soulless matchboxes anymore. I think what I'm looking for is the opportunity to create a future with harmony in between humans and nature."", '12:37': 'Thank you very much.', '12:38': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. But at dusk everything changes."", '00:41': 'The architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower. And then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them.', '00:58': ""We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. But the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light, recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. (Laughter)"", '01:25': ""This sound colors our first impression of any room; it can't be helped. But where does this sound, commonly described as a click, come from? Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action? Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment? The often dental consonant of no Indo-European language."", '01:56': 'Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? In the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls.', '02:14': 'But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room.', '02:31': ""The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter) Adults find it comforting."", '02:51': ""But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship? Or the recorded crowing of a rooster? Or the distant peel of thunder?"", '03:09': ""Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch? That's the end of that. (Applause)"", '03:31': 'The next story is called ""In Praise of the Taxpayer.""', '03:37': ""That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom, is cause for celebration."", '03:48': 'These one or two story structures, designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand, were not meant to be permanent buildings. Yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high-rise construction.', '04:16': 'Although they make no claim to architectural beauty, they are, in their perfect temporariness, a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place. The most perfect examples occupy corner lots. They offer a pleasant respite from the high-density development around them. A break of light and air, an architectural biding of time.', '04:49': 'So buried in signage are these structures, that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor: the small commercial building from an earlier century, whose upper floors have been sealed, and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer. The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive, dark green-gray, striated aluminum siding. Take-out sandwich shops, film processing drop-offs, peep-shows and necktie stores.', '05:35': ""Now these provisional structures have, in some cases, remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime. The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization, a healthy sublimation of the urge to build, and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone. That's the end. (Laughter)"", '06:09': 'And the next story is called, ""On the Human Lap."" For the ancient Egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead -- 30 cubits from foot to knee.', '06:25': ""It was not until the 14th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple, upholstered in flesh and cloth. Over the next 200 years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap, and then back again. Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways, or leaning against the body."", '07:02': ""From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy, is but a brief moment in history. You were late for school again this morning. The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. The illusion of speech follows incidentally. What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?"", '07:27': 'As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. We have fading memories of that provisional temple, erected each time an adult sat down. On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on. It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap, as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels.', '08:10': ""The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate. I envision a 36-story, 450-unit residential high-rise -- a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. The bathrooms and kitchens will, of course, have no windows. The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood, which we seek, in vain, as adults, to employ. That's the end. (Laughter)"", '08:54': 'The next story is called ""The Haverpiece Collection"" A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway, serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit.', '09:18': 'The profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry. The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.', '09:28': 'Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries? Where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.', '09:42': 'Pears dried in the form of genital organs. Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim.', '09:51': 'In 1962 the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece, a wealthy prune juice bottler, and consolidated to form the core collection. As an art form it lies somewhere between still-life painting and plumbing.', '10:13': 'Upon his death in 1967, a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant. (Laughter) Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century Turkish figs for breakfast. (Laughter)', '10:34': 'The rest of the collection remains here, stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center.', '10:48': 'A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar.', '10:54': ""That's the end.

Because fear is a state of certainty. You become morally judgmental. You become an extreme version of yourself. If you're a conservative, you become more conservative. If you're a liberal, you become more liberal. Because you go to a place of familiarity."", '04:07': ""The problem is that the world changes. And we have to adapt or die. And if you want to shift from A to B, the first step is not B. The first step is to go from A to not A -- to let go of your bias and assumptions; to step into the very place that our brain evolved to avoid; to step into the place of the unknown. But it's so essential that we go to this place that our brain gave us a solution. Evolution gave us a solution. And it's possibly one of the most profound perceptual experiences. And it's the experience of awe."", '04:53': '(Music)', '05:53': '(Applause)', '05:58': '(Music)', '06:06': '(Applause)', '06:10': '(Music)', '06:54': '(Applause)', '06:59': '(Music)', '07:14': '(Applause)', '07:19': '(Cheers)', '07:23': '(Applause)', '07:29': ""Beau Lotto: Ah, how wonderful, right? So right now, you're probably all feeling, at some level or another, awe. Right? So what's happening inside your brain right now? And for thousands of years, we've been thinking and writing and experiencing awe, and we know so little about it. And so to try to understand what is it and what does it do, my Lab of Misfits had just the wonderful opportunity and the pleasure to work with who are some of the greatest creators of awe that we know: the writers, the creators, the directors, the accountants, the people who are Cirque Du Soleil."", '08:17': 'And so we went to Las Vegas, and we recorded the brain activity of people while they\'re watching the performance, over 10 performances of ""O,"" which is iconic Cirque performance. And we also measured the behavior before the performance, as well as a different group after the performance. And so we had over 200 people involved.', '08:42': ""So what is awe? What is happening inside your brain right now? It's a brain state. OK? The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for your executive function, your attentional control, is now being downregulated. The part of your brain called the DMN, default mode network, which is the interaction between multiple areas in your brain, which is active during, sort of, ideation, creative thinking in terms of divergent thinking and daydreaming, is now being upregulated. And right about now, the activity in your prefrontal cortex is changing. It's becoming asymmetrical in its activity, biased towards the right, which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world, as opposed to step back. In fact, the activity across the brains of all these people was so correlated that we're able to train an artificial neural network to predict whether or not people are experiencing awe to an accuracy of 75 percent on average, with a maximum of 83 percent."", '09:52': 'So what does this brain state do? Well, others have demonstrated, for instance, Professors Haidt and Keltner, have told us that people feel small but connected to the world. And their prosocial behavior increases, because they feel an increased affinity towards others. And we\'ve also shown in this study that people have less need for cognitive control. They\'re more comfortable with uncertainty without having closure. And their appetite for risk also increases. They actually seek risk, and they are better able at taking it. And something that was really quite profound is that when we asked people, ""Are you someone who has a propensity to experience awe?"" They were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [before]. They literally redefined themselves and their history.', '10:50': 'So, awe is possibly the perception that is bigger than us. And in the words of Joseph Campbell, ""Awe is what enables us to move forward."" Or in the words of a dear friend, probably one of our greatest photographers, still living photographers, Duane Michaels, he said to me just the other day that maybe it gives us the curiosity to overcome our cowardice.', '11:18': ""So who cares? Why should we care? Well, consider conflict, which seems to be so omnipresent in our society at the moment. If you and I are in conflict, it's as if we're at the opposite ends of the same line. And my aim is to prove that you're wrong and to shift you towards me. The problem is, you are doing exactly the same. You're trying to prove that I'm wrong and shift me towards you. Notice that conflict is the setup to win but not learn. Your brain only learns if we move. Life is movement."", '11:52': ""So, what if we could use awe, not to get rid of conflict -- conflict is essential, conflict is how your brain expands, it's how your brain learns -- but rather, to enter conflict in a different way? And what if awe could enable us to enter it in at least two different ways? One, to give us the humility and courage to not know. Right? To enter conflict with a question instead of an answer. What would happen then? To enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty. And the second is, in entering conflict that way, to seek to understand, rather than convince. Because everyone makes sense to themselves, right? And to understand another person, is to understand the biases and assumptions that give rise to their behavior."", '12:44': ""And we've actually initiated a pilot study to look to see whether we could use art-induced awe to facilitate toleration. And the results are actually incredibly positive. We can mitigate against anger and hate through the experience of awe generated by art."", '13:03': ""So where can we find awe, given how important it is? So, what if ... A suggestion: that awe is not just to be found in the grandeur. Awe is essential. Often, it's scale -- the mountains, the sunscape. But what if we could actually rescale ourselves and find the impossible in the simple? And if this is true, and our data are right, then endeavors like science, adventure, art, ideas, love, a TED conference, performance, are not only inspired by awe, but could actually be our ladders into uncertainty to help us expand."", '14:24': 'Thank you very much.', '14:25': '(Applause)', '14:26': 'Please, come up.', '14:27': '(Applause)', '14:31': '(Cheers)', '14:36': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we imagine cities, we often imagine it to be something like this. But what if what you're looking at is just half a picture, but there is a city within the city. This part of the city is often seen as slums, squatters, informal, and people living here are called illegal, informal, criminals, beneficiaries, supplicants, etc. But in reality, these are poor people with no choices."", '00:40': 'Poverty is a vicious cycle. If born poor, it can take three or more generations to escape one. Many are forced in this cycle without choices, to live on pavements, along train tracks, in dumping grounds, along rivers, swamps and many such unlivable spaces, without clean water, toilets or housing.', '01:08': 'But these places are not unfamiliar to me, because since the age of six, I accompanied my father, a doctor, who treated patients in the slums of Bombay. Growing up, I would help him carry his bag of medicines after school lessons -- I loved doing that. Wanting to do something about these habitats, I decided to become an architect. But quite early on, I realized that the beauty of architecture was only for the rich. So I decided to do urban planning and joined an NGO in India that works with the urban poor who organize themselves to access basic services, such as water, sanitation and housing, for the poor living in cities.', '01:50': 'Now I spent 10 years of my life in professional education, in learning, and then five years in unlearning it. Because I realized that all my training in architecture, design and planning failed ground realities. And this is where I learned the power of choice. I unlearned many things, but there are two myths about the poor that I would like to share that we live with.', '02:20': 'The first myth is a perception that migration of poor people into cities is a problem. Is migration really a choice? My mentor Sheela Patel asked to those who think of this as a problem, ""Go ask your grandfather where he came from,"" she says.', '02:42': 'So what do poor people do when they migrate in cities? Let me share an example. This is the Mumbai International Airport. All that you see in blue are large informal settlements around it. Close to 75,000 people live here. So who are these people that work silently in hotels, restaurants, as laborers, babysitters, house helps and countless other jobs that we need for cities to function without a glitch? And where do they live? In most cities, they live in slums. So let us think again. Do we want poor people to stop migrating in our cities? What if they had a choice of not to?', '03:28': 'The second myth is my personal experience. It\'s this attitude that we professionals know better. We professionals love to make choices for others, especially for the poor. Let me share an experience. In a workshop that looked at designing 250 new houses for poor families from a slum nearby, there were different building materials that were presented, ranging from papier-mâché, cardboard, honeycomb, etc., simply because they were affordable. But there was this one idea that was of shipping containers. Now we immediately approved of it, because we thought it was sustainable, scalable, affordable. But during this presentation, a lady from the slum humbly spoke up. And she asked the presenter, ""Would you choose to live in it?""', '04:21': '(Laughter)', '04:24': '""If not, then why did you think we would?"" Now this was a personal unlearning moment for me, where I realized that poverty only changes affordability -- it does not change aspirations.', '04:37': 'Now poor people have lived in temporary structures all their life. They go from wall to wall, moving from bricks to tin. They move from building from bamboo, tarpaulin sheets, plastic, to cardboard, to tin, to bricks and cement, just like the way we do. So somewhere here, we were forcing our choices on them. So should we force our choices on them, or should we broaden their choices?', '05:04': ""Now what if the opportunity to choose was given to people? These are women who lived on the pavements of a neighborhood in Mumbai. Now they faced constant evictions, and in response to it, they organized a women's network called Mahila Milan. Not only did they fight against evictions with those in power, saved money and bought land, but they also designed and helped construct their own houses. Well, these were illiterate women, so how did they do that? They used floor mats and saris to understand measurements. A sari is four meters in length and 1.5 meters in width. They used these simple day-to-day items to demonstrate house models. And even they made three options to choose from and invited all their fellow residents to come and have a look."", '05:57': '(Laughter)', '05:59': 'And everybody loved this option that had a loft in it, simply because it did two things. One is that it accommodated larger families to sleep in. And two, it allowed home-based work, such as bangle-making, jewelry-designing, embroidery-stitching, packaging items, etc. Now they also decided to not have a toilet inside, but instead have it outside in the corridors, simply because it gave them more space and it was cheaper. Now, professionals could have never thought of something like that. A formal design would have necessitated to have a toilet inside.', '06:39': ""Now these are smaller examples -- let me share some larger context: 881,000,000 people -- that's about one sixth of this world, as we talk here -- are living in slums and informal settlements. Almost every city in the global south has large slums in the size of townships. Kibera, in Nairobi, Dharavi, in Mumbai, Khayelitsha in South Africa, just a few. Now initially, they were all on waste and abandoned lands that cities were never interested in. As cities grew, poor people started building on these lands and brought value to this over time. And today, these lands have become real estate hot spots that everybody wants a piece of."", '07:30': 'So how do cities and those in power choose to deal with them? They demolish them and evict them and move them away from their cities and economies in order to build a new infrastructure. They move them into vertical housing, which in reality looks like this. Now when built in high densities, they lack natural light and ventilation, and it often leads to unhealthy conditions.', '08:01': ""Now, on one hand, poor people are not involved in the participation of design, and there is poor quality of construction. And on the other hand, they do not understand how to do maintenance, you know, keeping bills, keeping records, forming societies -- this is always difficult for them. And being forced to move into this formal society, they end up looking like this in a few years. Because formalization is not a product, it's a process. Moving from informal to formal for poor people is a journey. It takes time to accept and adapt. And when that choice is not given, it becomes like this, which I'm afraid, in future, these would become the slums."", '08:50': 'Now instead of doing this, what if we accommodated poor people and gave them a choice to be a part of our cities and develop them where they are, giving them basic services, like in this picture? Now what happens if cities and governments could work together, if governments acknowledge poor people, and they could build it together?', '09:11': ""This is Mukuru. It's a large informal settlement in Nairobi. It's one of the largest settlements in Africa. It's home to 300,000 people living over 650 acres of land. To help us understand that scale, it's like squeezing the population of Pittsburgh into the New York Central Park. That's Mukuru. So to give us a glimpse, this is the condition of housing. And this is what it is in between them."", '09:45': ""So what is life in Mukuru like, just talking briefly? Five hundred and fifty people use one single water tap and pay nine times more than what anybody else in the city could pay, simply because there is no water infrastructure and water is sold. Many come back from work to find out that their houses do not exist, because they have either been bulldozed, or they have been burned down. So, tired of this situation, a local slum dwellers' federation called Muungano decided to do something about it. In four years, they organized 20,000 residents to collect data, map structures and put it together. And the plan was very simple -- they only needed four things. They wanted clean water, toilets, decent roads and, most importantly, not to be evicted."", '10:43': 'So they presented this with the government of Nairobi. And for the first time in history ever, a city has agreed to do it. The city of Nairobi, the government of Kenya, declared Mukuru to be a special planning area, which means that people could come up with their own plan. People could decide to come up with their own norms and standards, because the standards that work for the formal citizens do not work in informal settings.', '11:10': ""So what does that mean, to give us an instance? If these are roads in Mukuru, you can see that there are houses along both sides of the road. Now in order to bring in a city bus, as per the standards, planners would have gone for a luxurious 25-meter-wide road. Now that would mean displacing [25] percent of the structures -- that's a lot of people. So instead of doing that, we came up with a 12-meter-wide road, which had the structures intact and brought the city bus without compromising on much services."", '11:46': ""In another instance, let's talk about community toilets. You know, in high-density areas, where there is no scope for individual toilets, like the public toilets that we have here. So we would go for a male section and a female section. But imagine this situation. In the morning rush hours to the toilet, when everybody is in intense pressure to relieve themselves, and if you're standing in a queue of 50 people, and there is a child standing behind an adult, who wins? Children end up squatting outside. And that's why women decided to come up with a separate squatting area for children. Now, who could have thought of something like that?"", '12:29': ""The idea here is that when poor people choose, they choose better. They choose what works for them. So choice is everything. And power decides choice. And we need those in power -- politicians, leaders, governments, architects, planners, institutions, researchers -- and all of us in our everyday lives to respect choices. Instead of choosing what is right for people, for the poor, let's acknowledge and empower their choices. And that is how we can build better and inclusive cities for tomorrow, completing the imagery of cities built by the choices of its own people."", '13:13': 'Thank you.', '13:14': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I guess it is possible that I\'m then the only person who has obsessed enough about that question to make it my career. But moving on.', '00:36': ""How do we get to this question? Well, I would argue the first thing to do is to turn our eyes back down from the sky to our own planet, the Earth. And think about just how lucky did the Earth have to be to be the living planet it is. Well, it had to be at least somewhat lucky. Had we been sitting closer to the Sun or a bit further away, any water that we have had would have boiled off or frozen over. And I mean, it's not a given that a planet has water on it. So had we been a dry planet, there would not have been a lot of life on it. And even if we had had all the water that we have today, if that water had not been accompanied by the right kind of chemicals to get life going, we would have a wet planet, but just as dead. So it's so many things that can go wrong, what are the chances that they go right? What are the chances that the planet forms with at least the basic ingredients needed to have an origins of life happening?"", '01:42': ""Well, let's explore that together. So if you're going to have a living planet, the first thing you're going to need is a planet."", '01:52': '(Laughter)', '01:53': ""But not any planet will do. You're probably going to need a rather specific and earthlike planet. A planet that is rocky, so you can have both oceans and land, and it's sitting neither too close nor too far away from its star, but at the just-right temperature. And it's just right for liquid water, that is."", '02:12': ""So how many of these planets do we have in our galaxy? Well, one of the great discoveries of the past decades is that planets are incredibly common. Almost every star has a planet around them. Some have many. And among these planets, on the order of a few percent are earthlike enough that we would consider them potentially living planets. So having the right kind of planet is actually not that difficult when we consider that there's about 100 billion stars in our galaxy. So that gives you about a billion potential living planets."", '02:49': ""But it's not enough to just be at the right temperature or have the right overall composition. You also need the right chemicals. And what the second and important ingredient to make a living planet is -- I think it's pretty intuitive -- it's water. After all, we did define our planet as being potentially living if it had the right temperature to keep water liquid. And I mean, here on Earth, life is water-based. But more generally, water is just really good as a meeting place for chemicals. It is a very special liquid. So this is our second basic ingredient."", '03:29': ""Now the third ingredient, I think, is probably a little bit more surprising. I mean, we are going to need some organics in there, since we are thinking about organic life. But the organic molecule that seems to be at the center of the chemical networks that can produce biomolecules is hydrogen cyanide. So for those of you who know what this molecule is like, you know it's something that it's a good idea to stay away from. But it turns out that what's really, really bad for advanced life forms, such as yourselves, is really, really good to get the chemistry started, the right kind of chemistry that can lead to origins of life."", '04:10': 'So now we have our three ingredients that we need, you know, the temperate planet, water and hydrogen cyanide. So how often do these three come together? How many temperate planets are there out there that have water and hydrogen cyanide? Well, in an ideal world, we would now turn one of our telescopes towards one of these temperate planets and check for ourselves. Just, ""Do these planets have water and cyanides on them?"" Unfortunately, we don\'t yet have large enough telescopes to do this. We can detect molecules in the atmospheres of some planets. But these are large planets sitting often pretty close to their star, nothing like these, you know, just-right planets that we\'re talking about here, which are much smaller and further away.', '05:01': ""So we have to come up with another way. And the other way that we have conceived of and then followed is to instead of looking for these molecules in the planets when they exist, is to look for them in the material that's forming new planets. So planets form in discs of dust and gas around young stars. And these discs get their material from the interstellar medium. Turns out that the empty space you see between stars when you are looking up towards them, asking existential questions, is not as empty as it seems, but actually full of gas and dust, which can, you know, come together in clouds, then collapses to form these discs, stars and planets."", '05:42': ""And one of the things we always see when we do look at these clouds is water. You know, I think we have a tendency to think about water as something that's, you know, special to us. Water is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe, including in these clouds, these star- and planet-forming clouds. And not only that -- water is also a pretty robust molecule: it's actually not that easy to destroy. So a lot of this water that is in interstellar medium will survive the rather dangerous, collapsed journey from clouds to disc, to planet. So water is alright. That second ingredient is not going to be a problem. Most planets are going to form with some access to water."", '06:30': ""So what about hydrogen cyanide? Well, we also see cyanides and other similar organic molecules in these interstellar clouds. But here, we're less certain about the molecules surviving, going from the cloud to the disc. They're just a bit more delicate, a bit more fragile. So if we're going to know that this hydrogen cyanide is sitting in the vicinity of new planets forming, we'd really need to see it in the disc itself, in these planet-forming discs."", '07:01': 'So about a decade ago, I started a program to look for this hydrogen cyanide and other molecules in these planet-forming discs. And this is what we found. So good news, in these six images, those bright pixels represent emissions originating from hydrogen cyanide in planet-forming discs hundreds of light-years away that have made it to our telescope, onto the detector, allowing us to see it like this. So the very good news is that these discs do indeed have hydrogen cyanide in them. That last, more elusive ingredient.', '07:44': ""Now the bad news is that we don't know where in the disc it is. If we look at these, I mean, no one can say they are beautiful images, even at the time when we got them. You see the pixel size is pretty big and it's actually bigger than these discs themselves. So each pixel here represents something that's much bigger than our solar system. And that means that we don't know where in the disc the hydrogen cyanide is coming from. And that's a problem, because these temperate planets, they can't access hydrogen cyanide just anywhere, but it must be fairly close to where they assemble for them to have access to it."", '08:26': ""So to bring this home, let's think about an analogous example, that is, of cypress growing in the United States. So let's say, hypothetically, that you've returned from Europe where you have seen beautiful Italian cypresses, and you want to understand, you know, does it make sense to import them to the United States. Could you grow them here? So you talk to the cypress experts, they tell you that there is indeed a band of not-too-hot, not-too-cold across the United States where you could grow them. And if you have a nice, high-resolution map or image like this, it's quite easy to see that this cypress strip overlaps with a lot of green fertile land pixels. Even if I start degrading this map quite a bit, making it lower and lower resolution, it's still possible to tell that there's going to be some fertile land overlapping with this strip. But what about if the whole United States is incorporated into a single pixel? If the resolution is that low. What do you do now, how do you now tell whether you can grow cypresses in the United States? Well the answer is you can't. I mean, there's definitely some fertile land there, or you wouldn't have that green tint to the pixel, but there's just no way of telling whether any of that green is in the right place."", '09:48': ""And that is exactly the problem we were facing with our single-pixel images of these discs with hydrogen cyanide. So what we need is something analogous, at least those low-resolution maps that I just showed you, to be able to tell whether there's overlap between where the hydrogen cyanide is and where these planets can access it as they are forming."", '10:09': ""So coming to the rescue, a few years ago, is this new, amazing, beautiful telescope ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array in northern Chile. So, ALMA is amazing in many different ways, but the one that I'm going to focus on is that, as you can see, I call this one telescope, but you can there are actually many dishes in this image. And this is a telescope that consists of 66 individual dishes that all work in unison. And that means that you have a telescope that is the size of the largest distance that you can put these dishes away from one another. Which in ALMA's case are a few miles. So you have a more than mile-sized telescope. And when you have such a big telescope, you can zoom in on really small things, including making maps of hydrogen cyanide in these planet-forming discs."", '11:07': ""So when ALMA came online a few years ago, that was one of the first things that I proposed that we use it for. And what does a map of hydrogen cyanide look like in a disc? Is the hydrogen cyanide at the right place? And the answer is that it is. So this is the map. You see the hydrogen cyanide emission being spread out across the disc. First of all, it's almost everywhere, which is very good news. But you have a lot of extra bright emission coming from close to the star towards the center of the disc. And this is exactly where we want to see it. This is close to where these planets are forming. And this is not what we see just towards one disc -- here are three more examples. You can see they all show the same thing -- lots of bright hydrogen cyanide emission coming from close to the center of the star."", '11:58': ""For full disclosure, we don't always see this. There are discs where we see the opposite, where there's actually a hole in the emission towards the center. So this is the opposite of what we want to see, right? This is not places where we could research if there is any hydrogen cyanide around where these planets are forming. But in most cases, we just don't detect hydrogen cyanide, but we detect it in the right place."", '12:22': ""So what does all this mean? Well, I told you in the beginning that we have lots of these temperate planets, maybe a billion or so of them, that could have life develop on them if they have the right ingredients. And I've also shown that we think a lot of the time, the right ingredients are there -- we have water, we have hydrogen cyanide, there will be other organic molecules as well coming with the cyanides. This means that planets with the most basic ingredients for life are likely to be incredibly common in our galaxy."", '12:57': 'And if all it takes for life to develop is to have these basic ingredients available, there should be a lot of living planets out there. But that is of course a big if. And I would say the challenge of the next decades, for both astronomy and chemistry, is to figure out just how often we go from having a potentially living planet to having an actually living one.', '13:22': 'Thank you.', '13:23': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past 10 years, five million more people like Inook in Malawi have gained access to fresh water. But what\'s unfortunate is that this picture is a lie. I\'ll come back to that in a second.', '00:35': 'Ten years ago, two Waterloo engineers sparked a movement across Canada, ""Engineers Without Borders."" This movement was based on the concept that it was completely unacceptable that 5 million people in Malawi did not have access to fresh water, when us engineers back in Canada were working on problems such as making a photocopier increase its speed from 149 pages a minute to 151 pages per minute. We needed to work on problems that mattered. I was fortunate, I founded the Calgary chapter here. I got to be the first director of overseas programs for Engineers Without Borders in Africa, where I worked for four years. And I got to work with hundreds of businesses, non-government organizations, governments, all working in this field of development. It was really fantastic working for Engineers Without Borders because even though we worked on hundred-million-dollar projects, we had this philosophy that if we were really going to understand the problems in local Africa, we needed to live like local Africans. So, as a lot of ex-patriots would spend most of the time in the capital cities and boardrooms, we\'d spend our time in villages learning local languages, traveling on public transports.', '01:39': 'And what this allowed us to do was to get a really deep understanding of what was going on at the field level. Combined with this experience and hundreds of other Engineers Without Borders experiences, we got a really interesting perspective of what\'s going on in this aid industry. The aid industry has gotten a lot of attention lately. A lot of economists have become authors and have written about it. There\'s a lot of controversy about its effectiveness, some even asking the question, ""Has aid failed?"" It\'s a very interesting question. Now, I can confidently say on behalf of Engineers Without Borders staff members that, failed or not, we definitely feel that the aid system is broken. And when I say broken, I\'m not talking about what the media usually talks about. It\'s not about corrupt dictators or about corruption. Those issues still happen in Africa, but they\'re much more the minority than they are the mainstream today. I\'m talking about aid being broken in democratically elected, stable governments with no civil unrest, countries like Ghana, Malawi and Zambia.', '02:39': 'So, I talked about Malawi. The World Bank has stated that 80% of the people in Malawi have access to fresh water sources. So one of our staff members in Malawi, this is Owen, was visiting one of those water points. It was a gravity-fed system that was commissioned by the Canadian government and finished about a year and a half ago. A gravity-fed system basically is a bunch of pipes that pipe water down from an elevated region down into a number of communities where there are taps, and people can access that water. And he was going around turning on some of those taps, and some weren\'t working. So he asked the community, ""How many of these aren\'t working?"" And they said, ""Well, out of 113, 81."" 81? What\'s the problem? What\'s going on?', '03:21': ""He found out that a lot of the pipes had sprung leaks and broken down. All right, not a big deal, pipes break down everywhere. But the problem with this project was that, even though the infrastructure was built, there was no thinking about who was going to maintain the system. Some people really took initiative and tried to fix the pipes themselves, but there was a lack of affordable spare parts available. This situation is typical. This is a graphic showing one area of Malawi, I think it's an urban area, where the green dots are functional water points, yellow, are ones that are working but breaking down, and red are not functional. Hardly eighty percent. Actually, Engineers Without Borders has done some work and found out that even though there's 80% coverage of water points, 40% are not working. See, this issue is ... A lot of donors and projects end up focusing on the hardware side of the issue and not really realizing the importance of the software side of things. At first it's like, software -- of course you have to do maintenance. But when you think about it as people donating to charities, it makes you feel a lot better if you know that your money went to something tangible, something like a well, something like a school, something like giving a family a goat. It's not as sexy and easy to tell your friends about how you helped fund a water committee or paid for teacher salaries. So when I say that this picture of Inook is a lie, it's not a lie when the picture is taken. It only becomes a lie a year or two afterwards."", '04:56': 'When looking at these pictures, one of my great colleagues said, ""Everything people see from Africa doesn\'t matter. And everything that matters from Africa, people don\'t get to see."" And this problem goes a lot further that just broken down water points. Owen, after seeing this water point, discovered not more than 30 feet away: ""Hey there\'s another set of taps that look really broken down, too, but they\'re not attached to the system."" And he asked the community, ""What\'s that?"" They said: ""Oh, that\'s the American government gravity-fed water system."" It was built over ten years ago. He said, ""What happened to that?"" They said, ""Oh, it also broke down about a year and a half later."" How is it that a project that failed ten years ago was rebuilt with almost the same technology, same process, and had exactly the same failure ten years later?', '05:46': ""I've recently joined a start-up company that sells goods online, a lot of them from Africa, fair-trade goods -- it's sort of like the ethical eBay or Amazon. And what we've learned being a private sector start-up is, if we don't serve our customers and we don't provide them the product they need, they won't buy it. And then if we don't innovate, change and adapt to their needs, we go out of business. They have a power to hold us accountable. If we look to the public sector, it doesn't adapt and change quite as fast as the private sector, but at the end of the day, if the elected government doesn't meet the needs of its constituents, they have a chance to vote them out of power, therefore holding them accountable."", '06:22': ""But in the development sector, if they don't serve the needs of their beneficiaries -- and they're not just NGOs, but governments and businesses as well -- the beneficiaries have no power to vote them out or to fire them. The people who have that power are the donors. And when you look at the system, you can see some of the challenges. Development is the sector that focuses more on pleasing the donors and making them happy and communicating to them, as opposed to understanding the needs of the beneficiaries. Because of that, systematic challenge is very slow to innovate, there's very little change, and you get exactly the same project built ten years later that fails in exactly the same way."", '06:56': ""So what we do about this? First answer is easy: we invest in the private and public sectors in the developing world. They're inherently structurally built to be more sustainable and to allow beneficiaries to hold them accountable. However, 70% of people in sub-Saharan Africa still make less than two dollars a day and are still in poverty. And a lot of that reason is because the private and the public sector are not serving them appropriately. So we do need to invest in businesses and governments in Africa, but it's still going to take a long time for the problems to be fixed. Therefore, that leaves us with one option and we need to work with this system. Therefore, we have to fix it."", '07:31': ""We need to make it more accountable, more creative and more transparent. We need to start innovating, coming up with really neat ideas -- ideas like giving beneficiaries a chance to rate their projects using their mobile phones -- that donors and NGOs can understand. Or moving our donors closer to our beneficiaries. Currently, only 20% of the Canadian International Development Agency's African staff are based in Africa. Ideas like funding development sectors like VCs fund businesses: What would it be like if a donor funded ten projects and expected four of them to do OK, one of them to do fantastic and five of them to fail? And not all of the solutions need to be that complex. Engineers Without Borders is working on one that's actually quite simple; it's admitting failure."", '08:18': 'My first project with Engineers Without Borders was in India. I worked with a bunch of schools, the poorest schools in India, the untouchable caste. This is Bani, she was a girl who was in one of those schools and she and her classmates had to spend two to three hours a day walking to collect water to bring it back to the school so they could have fresh water to drink and for cooking and for going to the bathroom. My job in Engineers Without Borders was to help solve the problem. I worked with the communities; we came up with rainwater harvesting solutions to collect water from the rooftops during the monsoons, bring it through gutters, filter and store it for the dry season. I worked there for a number of months, and by the time I left, we had the project funded and being implemented. I returned back home to Canada almost a hero. My friends and family were like, ""Wow, that\'s fantastic! You gave up your job in the oil and gas sector to go volunteer in India. That\'s really inspiring.""', '09:07': ""A year later, I contacted my NGO to see how everything was going with the rainwater harvesting systems. And they told me that not a single one was still operating. The reason was because a lot of them had been built, but some of them had broken down because there was no maintenance schedule put in place. I had made the exact same mistake that I criticized earlier. When I thought of my friends and family back home who thought I was such a hero, I felt like an impostor. I thought of Bani, I didn't help her at all."", '09:46': ""Admitting failure is actually quite hard, and I didn't tell many people about this. And one of the only things that helped me feel better about this -- and it's a bit of a shame to say this — was that I started to learn that other people in Engineers Without Borders had failed, too. But Engineers Without Borders has this culture of embracing failure openly and letting us talk about it. And it was only through a bunch of us talking about failure that we really got to see we're making a lot of mistakes, and we're making the same mistakes and can learn from them. And we started to innovate and change."", '10:17': 'Engineers Without Borders is drastically different now, 10 years later than what we thought Engineers should be doing in development. We don\'t build water points anymore; in fact, we don\'t build anything other than spreadsheets. We now have this innovative marketing campaign, ""Sponsor an African spreadsheet,"" because we understand that the problems are not hardware problems; it\'s all about that software side of things. But it\'s a hard concept to get across to people; they want to fund wells and schools. But it\'s really about the software side of things, and it\'s a lot longer a process to fund those things. And it\'s not sexy, but it works. Our staff members were really exited to share this failure internally, but we still were not doing a good job of letting other people know. And some very courageous field staff were getting upset at the management because other projects were going to make the same failures; they weren\'t learning. So they pushed our management staff. And we were nervous publishing our failures, but for the last three years, Engineers Without Borders has published an annual failure report citing our biggest failures.', '11:14': 'At first, I was asked, ""What do your donors think?"" and I think, ""How would my donors feel if they knew the money they had spent and saved up and generously donated had had no impact?"" And you know, that\'s tough. And our donors felt that, too. But once they started reading the failures, they understood the power of those lessons learned and realized it\'s an injustice not to be sharing these. Then we realized that not everyone reads reports, so we built a website, admittingfailure.com. This is for all organizations to come and start admitting their failures, and to start having a discussion about failure. The concept is catching on.', '11:52': 'The Harvard Business Review, just last month, published their first review focused on failure. Two big companies lately have also dealt with failure. I talk to my friends in other sectors and they\'re like, ""It\'s not just the development sector that has this challenge, it crosses into a lot of other sectors."" Two companies had big failures lately. What\'s interesting about them is, one of them publicly admitted the failure and talked about what they learned from it and what they\'ll do next time. The other one kind of tried to not talk about it at all. It will be interesting looking forward to see which of those strategies works. I\'d like to ask people to, first of all, think about: How does your organization think about and share failure? Maybe ask the person next to you, because I think it can generate some really interesting conversations.', '12:39': 'And lastly, I\'d like to turn back to this question, ""Has aid failed?"" I think I\'ll say that, for me, the answer is ""Yes,"" but only because it hasn\'t failed enough.', '12:50': 'Thank you.', '12:51': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS. This is the most devastating epidemic of our time. We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics.', '00:37': ""So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. And this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa."", '00:55': ""But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa. The problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS."", '01:37': 'I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda. This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS. So this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.', '02:05': ""We all know about the miracle of miniaturization. Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers. But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries. The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories."", '02:38': 'So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school, and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices. This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. A close look at how the technology works: These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.', '03:11': 'So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system. So, with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone, you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time. For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient. And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options. So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.', '03:56': 'I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.', '04:04': 'Thank you very much.', '04:06': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the time of her exile, she had written 42 hymns and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her.', '00:36': 'Enheduanna lived 1,700 years before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before the biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities and high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great, history’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite who spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south viewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain their independence, fracturing his new dynasty.', '01:17': 'To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally served religious roles, and she was educated to read and write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations.', '01:36': ""The world's first writing started in Sumer as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping developed into a script about 300 years before Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing style, called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed into soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form of record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable to individual writers."", '02:10': 'Enheduanna’s Ur was a city of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries, and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna managed grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, interpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly new moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes.', '02:33': 'Enheduanna set about unifying the older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this, she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated to the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, glorified the god’s attributes, and explained the god’s relationship to other deities within the pantheon. In her writing, she humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, and responded to human pleading.', '03:09': 'Enheduanna’s most valuable literary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna, goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy that gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms of sexual expression and was considered so powerful that she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers.', '03:33': 'Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used to explore deep, private emotions.', '03:49': 'After the death of Enheduanna’s father, King Sargon, a general took advantage of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family, Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising and restored his aunt as high priestess.', '04:13': 'In total, Enheduanna served as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years.

It’s being used to run a heavily fortified train that runs all around the country, providing supplies to settlements and facilities. This armored behemoth undergoes a complex and unpredictable unloading procedure— a procedure which is displayed, in detail, on a screen within the engine car. Right means the train will go one car length forward, and left means the train will go the same distance backwards. While unloading, the train frequently moves back and forth, so a typical sequence might look like this.', '01:13': 'Also within the engine car is a button that can only be pressed once. When pressed, it lets down the force field over the artifact for 10 seconds. The engine car is tiny and designed for a robot. Of your team, only Hedge can fit.', '01:30': 'The members of the resistance have positioned a crane over the train tracks that can pluck the artifact once it’s exposed. They’ll know when to lower the crane by sight. But the only way Hedge can determine the train’s position and know when to lower the force field is by analyzing the unloading procedure, because he’ll be inside the windowless engine car. Hedge can’t program himself though, so it’s up to Ethic to tell him what to do.', '01:59': 'The artifact is in the car 10 positions behind the one that’s directly under the crane at the start. What instructions can Ethic give Hedge so that he hits the button at just the right moment?', '02:19': 'Here’s a hint to get you started.', '02:23': 'The key to this problem, as with many programming challenges, is to reframe the information in a way that a computer can work with. A computer doesn’t know what a train is, nor does it need to.', '02:35': 'It can, however, work with variables. Try making a variable that tracks the train’s position. How will it change as the train moves?', '02:52': 'Let’s start by breaking this problem into two objectives. The first is to know where the train will be as it carries out its instructions. The second is to hit the button when the train is in just the right position.', '03:06': 'For the first objective it’ll help to think of the train as a big number line. Let’s make 0 the car with the node, 1 the car in front of it, and so on. That means car 10 is under the crane at the start. When the train moves one car right, car 9 is under the crane. So a right arrow can be thought of as “subtract 1.” And when the train moves left from there, 10 is back under the crane, making a left arrow the same as “add 1.""', '03:35': 'Let’s set our train position variable to 10, since that’s where we start. We can now use a loop to read the instructions one at a time, adding or subtracting as we go, to track which car is under the crane.', '03:49': 'The nice thing about setting up the variable this way is that it tells us how far the node is from the crane. So as soon as the variable hits 0, Hedge should hit the button.', '03:59': 'And here’s what happens.', '04:01': 'Ethic gets into position on the crane while Hedge rushes off and slips into the engine car unnoticed, just before the train lurches to life. It rolls 3 cars back. 1 forward, another 4 back. Then so far forward Ethic loses track before it reverses once more.', '04:21': 'When the artifact finally rolls into position, Adila lowers the crane, hoping Ethic and Hedge got it right. At the last possible moment, the force field sputters and falls. Ethic swoops in, and lifts the Node of Power to freedom.', '04:37': 'When Ethic gives the node to Hedge for safe keeping, something incredible happens. The artifact shimmers to life with a vision of the past:', '04:46': 'When the crystal was unearthed, no one could make the console inside work. The government put out a call for people to try their luck with it, one at a time. Ethic loved to figure out what made things tick, so she signed up. Within moments at the console, something clicked into place, and she created her first robot. The government hired Ethic as chief robotics engineer on the spot. Within a year her creations ran almost every aspect of society, and the nation and its people thrived, no longer needing to toil in the fields and factories.', '05:27': 'The vision ends, and Hedge detects the second artifact in the 198forest, to the southeast. Luckily, the train is going there next, and has just enough reserve fuel for the trip. Ethic and Hedge smuggle themselves aboard and find a hiding spot for the long journey ahead.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you\'re not able to pay your bills on time, you can personalize that. I don\'t want anyone to think that I\'m not smart. I don\'t want anyone to know that I am very insecure with money. I don\'t want anyone to know that I am super stressed out.

And that's when your squad has to come in. It's taboo. We typically don't talk about our stresses when it comes to money. We need to come together as a group of friends, no judgment, no shame. Celebrate the fact that we've made a decision that we want to have a better relationship with money. That is worth applauding or snapping your fingers about."", '01:22': ""Once you've done that, then you get real. Nothing should be off-limits. Where does this relationship come from? Why am I spending all this money on things that don't align with my goals? What are your fears? What are your hopes? What are your dreams? But then we start to take action. What can we do this week? Or what can we do this month?"", '01:41': '[2: Understand what money is]', '01:44': ""Money is not the end-all be-all. It's the mechanism to accomplish whatever your goals are. It does not define you. It's just a mechanism to accomplish what matters to you most."", '01:56': '[3: Identify what matters to you ... ]', '01:58': ""Ask yourself one fundamental question: what are you saving for? If you're saving for a car, if you're saving to pay down your debt, if you're saving for that rainy day fund, it will include short-term goals and it will include long-term goals."", '02:11': '[4: ... and then really picture it.]', '02:14': 'Visualize what you\'re really trying to accomplish. A vision board is visual representation of what you\'re saving for. So if we break it down, go get a poster board. Get your markers, get your glitter. Take magazine pictures, cut it all out. Have that picture of that great trip. Have the picture of you paying down your student debt. The vision board sounds like, ""Oh, how can that really help?"" The point is your goals need to align with your behaviors, and the vision board is really a representation of where you wanna go and then how you live your life, and in the meantime are the steps to really get there.', '02:49': ""[5: It's not what you make, it's what you keep.]"", '02:52': 'It\'s not about what you make, it\'s about what you keep. It\'s about understanding do I have the ability with what I\'m making to take care of my basic needs? And if not, what adjustments do I need to make? And then we start to break it down and talk about the tools. We start to say, ""Do we have our savings account, auto-save?"" Set it and forget it, or every day, put a dollar a day. Whatever that rhythm is for you, the goal is the rhythm, not the amount. You can start slow. You can start small, but you have to start now. And then let me give you a trick, we all have impulses. Many times, because the phone is always with us, we start shopping. Go out to any site, shop up, put it in your cart. Just don\'t hit buy. Wait 24 hours, go back and ask yourself, ""Do I really need it? What about these items map to my goal?"" And if it\'s nothing, hit delete and you got your fix.', '03:45': '[6: Be good to yourself.]', '03:49': ""It's also important to know that your self-worth is not determined by your net worth. This is something that we can do better about. You celebrate your wins. And when you make that misstep, no judgment, no shame.

There's hardly a day that goes by that somebody is not reminding you of your color. Racism is my city's vivid hue."", '00:56': ""Now, we can all agree that race is a socially constructed phenomenon, but it's often hard to see it in our everyday existence. Its pervasiveness is everywhere. The neighborhoods I grew up in were filled with a kind of culturally coded beauty. Major commercial corridors were lined with brightly painted storefronts that competed for black consumer dollars. The visual mash-ups of corner stores and beauty supply houses, currency exchanges, are where I actually, inadvertently learned the foundational principles of something I would later come to know is called color theory. I can remember being pretty intimidated by this term in college -- color theory. All these stuffy old white guys with their treatises and obscure terminologies. I'd mastered each one of their color palettes and associated principles. Color theory essentially boils down to the art and science of using color to form compositions and spaces. It's not so complicated."", '02:07': ""This was my bible in college. Josef Albers posited a theory about the color red, and it always has stuck with me. He argues that the iconic color of a cola can is red, and that in fact all of us can agree that it's red but the kinds of reds that we imagine are as varied as the number of people in this room. So imagine that. This color that we've all been taught since kindergarten is primary -- red, yellow, blue -- in fact is not primary, is not irreducible, is not objective but quite subjective. What?"", '02:53': '(Laughter)', '02:54': 'Albers called this ""relational."" Relational. And so it was the first time that I was able to see my own neighborhood as a relational context. Each color is affected by its neighbor. Each other is affected by its neighbor.', '03:22': 'In the 1930s, the United States government created the Federal Housing Administration, which in turn created a series of maps which were using a color-coding system to determine which neighborhoods should and should not receive federal housing loans.

Banks would not lend to people who lived in neighborhoods like mine. That\'s me in D86. Their cartographers were literally coloring in these maps and labeling that color ""hazardous."" Red was the new black, and black neighborhoods were colored.', '04:24': ""The problem persists today, and we've seen it most recently in the foreclosure crisis. In Chicago, this is best symbolized by these Xs that are emblazoned on the fronts of vacated houses on the South and West Side. The reality is that someone else's color palettes were determining my physical and artistic existence. Ridiculous."", '04:52': 'I decided that I\'d create my own color palette and speak to the people who live where I do and alter the way that color had been defined for us. It was a palette that I didn\'t have to search far for and look for in a treatise, because I already knew it. What kind of painter emerges from this reality? What color is urban? What color is ghetto? What color is privilege? What color is gang-related? What color is gentrification? What color is Freddie Gray? What color is Mike Brown? Finally, I\'d found a way to connect my racialized understanding of color with my theoretical understanding of color. And I gave birth to my third baby: ""Color(ed) Theory.""', '05:56': '(Laughter)', '05:58': '""Color(ed) Theory"" was a two-year artistic project in which I applied my own color palette to my own neighborhoods in my own way.

Who needs ultramarine when you have ...', '06:45': '(Audience) Ultra Sheen.', '06:47': '(Laughter)', '06:49': 'This is exactly how I derived my palette. I would ask friends and family and people with backgrounds that were similar to mine for those stories and memories.

If you\'re from Chicago, ""Harold\'s Chicken Shack.""', '07:21': '(Laughter)', '07:23': '""Currency Exchange + Safe Passage."" ""Flamin\' Red Hots."" ""Loose Squares"" ... and ""Crown Royal Bag.""', '07:39': ""I painted soon-to-be-demolished homes in a much-maligned area called Englewood. We'd gather up as much paint as I could fit in my trunk, I'd call my most trusted art homies, my amazing husband always by my side, and we'd paint every inch of the exteriors in monochromatic fashion. I wanted to understand scale in a way that I hadn't before. I wanted to apply the colors to the biggest canvas I could imagine ... houses. So I'd obsessively drive up and down familiar streets that I'd grown up on, I'd cross-reference these houses with the city's data portal to make sure that they'd been tagged for demolition -- unsalvageable, left for dead. I really wanted to understand what it meant to just let color rule, to trust my instincts, to stop asking for permission. No meetings with city officials, no community buy-in, just let color rule in my desire to paint different pictures about the South Side."", '08:54': ""These houses sit in stark contrast to their fully lined counterparts.

""Aw, I thought Prince was coming.""', '09:38': '(Laughter)', '09:41': 'He had grown up on this block, and so you could imagine when he drove past and saw one of its last remaining houses mysteriously change colors overnight, it was clearly not a Crown Royal bag involved, it was a secret beacon from Prince.', '09:55': '(Laughter)', '09:59': 'And though that block was almost all but erased, it was the idea that Prince could pop up in unexpected places and give free concerts in areas that the music industry and society had deemed were not valuable anymore. For him, the idea that just the image of this house was enough to bring Prince there meant that it was possible. In that moment, that little patch of Eggleston had become synonymous with royalty. And for however briefly, Eric Bennett\'s neighborhood had regained its value. So we traded stories despite being strangers about which high school we\'d gone to and where we\'d grown up, and Mrs. So-and-so\'s candy store -- of being kids on the South Side. And once I revealed that in fact this project had absolutely nothing to do with Prince, Eric nodded in seeming agreement, and as we parted ways and he drove off, he said, ""But he could still come!""', '11:09': '(Laughter)', '11:11': 'He had assumed full ownership of this project and was not willing to relinquish it, even to me, its author. That, for me, was success.', '11:25': 'I wish I could tell you that this project transformed the neighborhood and all the indices that we like to rely on: increased jobs, reduced crime, no alcoholism -- but in fact it\'s more gray than that. ""Color(ed) Theory"" catalyzed new conversations about the value of blackness. ""Color(ed) Theory"" made unmistakably visible the uncomfortable questions that institutions and governments have to ask themselves about why they do what they do. They ask equally difficult questions of myself and my neighborhood counterparts about our value systems and what our path to collective agency needs to be. Color gave me freedom in a way that didn\'t wait for permission or affirmation or inclusion. Color was something that I could rule now. One of the neighborhood members and paint crew members said it best when he said, ""This didn\'t change the neighborhood, it changed people\'s perceptions about what\'s possible for their neighborhood,"" in big and small ways.', '12:40': 'Passersby would ask me, ""Why are you painting that house when you know the city\'s just going to come and tear it down?"" At the time, I had no idea, I just knew that I had to do something. I would give anything to better understand color as both a medium and as an inescapable way that I am identified in society. If I have any hope of making the world better, I have to love and leverage both of these ways that I\'m understood, and therein lies the value and the hue.', '13:13': 'Thank you.', '13:14': '(Applause and cheers)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The board’s size and light construction help it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while you wait to paddle for a wave.', '00:39': 'And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves represent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates water particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples that become waves. These deviations from the flat surface are acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface to its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors through the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through the water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the overall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains the motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region than out at sea, concentrating the wave energy near the surface. If the topography of the shoreline is even and smooth, this will refract the waves to become more parallel to the shore as they approach.', '01:49': 'This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board in the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure on the bottom of it, forcing you and your board out of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum makes you more stable, allowing you to stand up and surf along the wave.', '02:20': 'Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front face parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter your speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing their greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster than the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under gravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic curls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely enclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water known as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor and the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary 27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time passing differently inside, making it one of the most magical experiences a surfer can have.', '03:21': 'Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock formations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal or Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy into a single spot, creating massive waves sought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel for more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 kilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy seas near New Zealand.', '03:56': 'So while you may not be thinking about weather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave relies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the continuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe since its very beginning.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And -- (Laughter) -- you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible."", '00:55': ""So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us."", '01:49': ""Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us? And our own opportunity to make something new there? This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet, now, it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this."", '03:06': 'How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. There\'s the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. They\'ve made a selection. They\'ve chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go, ""Oh, I\'m really sorry, we screwed up."" Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let\'s bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.', '04:16': '(Laughter)', '04:18': ""It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme. This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical -- or something that's more of a romantic solution."", '05:21': ""Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the -- in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny. Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny? Manifest destiny."", '06:12': '(Laughter)', '06:13': ""It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we? Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle."", '06:50': '(Laughter)', '06:52': 'Why? Why? Why do you want to do that? Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.', '07:00': '(Laughter)', '07:01': ""It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment? I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young, one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is? Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it."", '07:57': ""This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No. It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times. That's because it's cheaper."", '08:43': 'Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment\'s notice, because the computer is just a machine. It doesn\'t care. It\'s manufacturing the parts. It doesn\'t see any excess cost. It doesn\'t spend any extra time. It\'s not a laborer -- it\'s simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you\'ve seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, ""Bolt A to B, and C to D."" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple ""Bolt A to B"" and they will be able to put them together. Here\'s the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that\'s what will happen in the end.', '09:50': ""You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series. And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? In the summer, you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up."", '10:42': ""What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built. There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool. It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long."", '11:36': ""Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur."", '12:40': 'Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may. Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It\'s not to create a technological solution, it\'s to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition. ""When it\'s all said and done, it\'s got to look like seaweed,"" said the owner. Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '13:30': ""I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside."", '14:20': ""In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square -- I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They might live on in a realistic, simulated environment with avatar bodies, and could still call in and contribute to the biological world.', '00:29': 'Mind uploading has powerful appeal— but what would it actually take to scan a person’s brain and upload their mind? The main challenges are scanning a brain in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating that detail artificially.', '00:46': 'But first, we have to know what to scan. The human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a hundred trillion synapses. The pattern of connectivity among the brain’s neurons, that is, all of the neurons and all their connections to each other, is called the connectome. We haven’t yet mapped the connectome, and there’s also a lot more to neural signaling. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of different kinds of connections, or synapses. Each functions in a slightly different way. Some work faster, some slower. Some grow or shrink rapidly in the process of learning; some are more stable over time. And beyond the trillions of precise, 1-to-1 connections between neurons, some neurons also spray out neurotransmitters that affect many other neurons at once. All of these different kinds of interactions would need to be mapped in order to copy a person’s mind. There are also a lot of influences on neural signaling that are poorly understood or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type of cell called glia. Glia surround neurons and, according to some scientists, may even outnumber them by as many as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely for structural support, and their functions are still poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate their own signals that influence information processing.', '02:17': 'Our understanding of the brain isn’t good enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order to replicate the mind, but assuming our knowledge does advance to that point, how would we scan it? Currently, we can accurately scan a living human brain with resolutions of about half a millimeter using our best non-invasive scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of individual synapses would requires a field strength high enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere near good enough– and requires killing the subject first.', '03:22': 'Assuming we eventually understand the brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track of such massive data sets.', '04:10': 'At every step in the scanning and uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined version of a mind might emerge.', '04:24': 'While mind uploading is theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload our minds, whether we should remains an open question.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's only later on in the 17th century that it became more mass produced."", '00:45': 'Whenever you design an object of any kind, you think of how you want it to perform. So think about the same for pasta. Do you want it to be ribbed or you want it to be smooth? The ribbed ones absorb the sauce better. Do you want them to be round or do you want them to be square? They have a different feel on the palate. Everything is for a reason.', '01:06': ""In the amazing taxonomy of the pasta species, there are many different ways to divide it, but one of the basic divisions is between fresh pasta and dry pasta. Dry pasta is always durum wheat flour and water. Fresh pasta could be either that or it could be flour and eggs. Just think of having a dough that you can shape in any way you want. I mean, really, wouldn't you go crazy?"", '01:32': ""So fresh and dry, but then, there's also long and short. And then within those families, there's even more diversity.

When you hone one object across centuries, standards become really, really high."", '02:28': 'Many so-called great designers failed miserably, because they tried to impose a shape onto pasta. The great Philippe Starck tried mandala. Some parts of it, the walls, were very thick, and the others were thinner, so when you would boil the pasta, some of it would be completely mushy while part of it was too crunchy and uncooked. So really wrong, but they were not women from Bologna, they were not chefs from Naples, they were not centuries of families of grandmothers that were trying to improve on the thinness of the walls of the pasta.', '03:07': ""There's no way to trace pasta back to one designer, one inventor, and that's the beauty of it.

My name is Keith Nolan. I’m a cadet private. My talk today is on the topic of the military. How many of you out there thought you’d ever like to join the military? I see a number of you nodding. And I thought the same thing ever since I was young.', '00:25': 'Growing up, I’d always wanted to join the military. I loved military history and I’ve read a great deal on the subject. Also, I have various family members, such as my grandfather and great uncle, who fought in World War II. And like them, I wanted the same thing: to serve my country. So the question is: Can I? No, I can’t. Why? Simply because I’m deaf. Regardless of that fact, I still had that longing to join the military.', '00:54': 'For example, after I graduated from high school, three months before 9/11 occurred, I went to a naval recruiting center with high hopes of joining the navy. I went in and a strapping naval man stood up and addressed me. As he was speaking to me, it was impossible for me to read his lips, so I said, “I\'m sorry, I’m deaf.” He tore off a little piece of paper and wrote down three words: “Bad ear. Disqual.” He didn\'t even fully spell out ""Disqualified,"" just: “Bad ear. Disqual.” So I went on my way. I tried various locations a number of different times, trying to join, but over and over again, I got the same response: “Sorry, you’re deaf. We can’t accept you.”', '01:38': ""So I shifted gears and decided to become a teacher. I completed a master's in deaf education and taught for almost two years, until this past spring, when three things occurred that changed that course, the first of which, while I was teaching a high school history class. I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War. The bell had rung, and I was seated at my desk, when one of my students, who is deaf, approached me and said that he’d like to join the military. I said, “Ah, sorry. You can’t. You're deaf.” Then I caught myself. It struck me that all along I had been told no, I can’t, and now I was perpetuating that same message to the next generation, to my own student. That realization had a large impact that really resonated with me."", '02:19': 'Now, the second thing that happened, my friend had just moved to Israel. Did you know that in Israel they accept deaf people into the military? How can deaf people be in the military, right? Could this really be true? Come on! Well, I went to Israel last summer to see for myself. I interviewed 10 deaf Israeli soldiers, all of those video interviews and questions I’ve compiled, and the findings, I’ll share with you later.', '02:42': ""Thirdly, CSUN here, my alma mater, had recently started up an Army ROTC program. ROTC, which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps, allows students working on their college majors to concurrently participate in the ROTC program. Upon graduation, ROTC students have a military career ready and waiting for them. So if one joined the army, one could commission as a second lieutenant. That's generally the ROTC program here at CSUN."", '03:10': 'Having learned that, I was intrigued. I already had a profession as a teacher, but I went ahead anyway and sent an email off to the program, explaining that I was a teacher of the deaf, wondering if I could take a few classes with them and perhaps share their lessons with my students. I got an email response back, and surprisingly, it was the first time that I wasn\'t told, ""Sorry, no, you can’t. You’re deaf."" It said, ""Well, that\'s interesting. I think maybe we can work something out and you can take a few classes with us."" This was unprecedented. So naturally, I was shocked. Although I was teaching, I decided I had to grab the opportunity right away and get my foot in the door. Altogether, that\'s how it transpired. Now, with all my life experiences, having talked with all the people I had, and given everything I’ve read, I decided to write a research paper called “Deaf in the Military.” I\'ll share with you what those 98 pages entail.', '04:05': 'Here in America, we’ve actually had deaf soldiers serving in the past. In fact, during the Texas War of Independence, there was a key character named Deaf Smith, who made a large contribution to that war effort. For the American Civil War, Gallaudet University actually has archived a list of deaf soldiers in that war from the North and the South, showing that deaf soldiers were even fighting against each other. During World War II, there are a few rare examples of deaf people who made it into the military at that time and were able to serve their country as well. History illustrates the fact that America has had deaf soldiers, in contrast to today.', '04:40': ""In my paper, I also discuss the deaf Israeli soldiers. I learned that they serve in non-combat roles. The deaf soldiers are not on the front lines engaged in fire, but rather, are behind the lines serving in supportive roles. There are a plethora of various non-combat jobs accessible to the deaf: intelligence, computer technology, map drawing, supply, military dog training -- the list goes on. The communication between deaf Israeli soldiers and other soldiers who are hearing is carried out with the same approaches deaf people in general use with the hearing public on a daily basis. You can use your voice, lip-read, gestures, sometimes another soldier knows sign language and that can be utilized, pen and paper, texts, computers, emails -- seriously, there’s no magic wand necessary. It's the same thing we do every day. Interpreters are used there primarily for boot camp training. For the average work, it’s not necessary to have an interpreter by your side. The Israeli Army is comprised of small groups. Each of these units with deaf soldiers have developed their own way of communicating with each other, so there’s no need for interpreters. The top picture is of one soldier I met. The bottom photo is of Prime Minister Begin with a deaf soldier in Israel."", '05:52': ""Another part of my paper touches on disabled soldiers in the US Military. Obviously, military work can be dangerous and involve injury. One example here is Captain Luckett. Due to an explosion, he lost his leg. He’s recovered and currently has a prosthetic leg. Now that he’s strong, he's back in combat, still fighting in Afghanistan. It’s remarkable. And guess what? He’s not the only one. There are 40 other soldiers like him, amputees who are serving in combat zones. Incredible."", '06:26': 'Also, we have a blind soldier here. While he was in Iraq, an explosion from a suicide car bomber destroyed his eyesight. He’s recovered and hasn’t left the army. The army has retained him on active duty, and he’s currently running a hospital for wounded soldiers. I also found out online about another soldier, who is deaf in one ear. He’s developed civil programs in Iraq, one of which actually started a school for the deaf in Iraq. All of this is incredible. But I am going to ask all of you: If the US Military can retain their disabled soldiers, why can’t they accept disabled citizens as well? Moreover, out of all the US Military jobs, 80% are non-combat positions. There are many jobs that we in the Deaf community can do. If I were to be in the military, I’d like to do intelligence work. But there is an array of other things we can do, such as mechanics, finance, medicine, etc.', '07:27': 'So to summarize, I’ve presented three premises to support my argument, the first being, Israeli defense openly accepts deaf soldiers. If you have the qualities and skills required, they’ll take you. Secondly, the US Military has accommodations for retaining their disabled soldiers. And lastly, 80% of occupations in the military are non-combat. Now, can we Deaf Americans serve our country? Yes! Of course! Absolutely, without a doubt!', '07:57': 'Now I’ll explain a bit about my experience in the Army ROTC, which began last fall. I have been involved with that thus far and it’s still going on now. Really, I need to preface this by saying that this is the first time my battalion had ever had a deaf cadet. They had never experienced that before. So of course, they were taken aback, wondering, initially, how I would do this or that, how would we communicate and such, which is a natural reaction, considering that many of them had never interacted with a deaf person prior to me. Plus, I was taken aback by this -- it was the real thing, the army. I had to learn a whole new world, full of military jargon, with its own culture and everything. So we started out slow, getting to know each other and learning how to work together, progressively.', '08:45': ""For example, on the first day of class, I had no uniform. So I showed up in regular clothes, while the other cadets were all in uniform. I found out that every morning at 5:30, there was physical training, PT. On Fridays, there would be field training -- labs -- off-campus, and occasionally, we would have weekend training at a military base. So I showed up, ready, each morning at 5:30, with all the cadets in uniform and me in civilian clothes. They told me, “Hey, you know, you don't need to work out. You can just simply take classes.” I told them I wanted to, anyway. They acknowledged that, and I continued to show up every morning to train."", '09:21': 'When Friday came, I asked if I could do the field training. I was told no, just stick with class. I insisted that I wanted to try. Somewhat reluctantly, they let me attend the lab, but only as an observer; I would only be allowed to sit and watch, not participate. Alright, so, I showed up on Friday, and watched as the cadets learned marching drill commands, like how to stand at attention, how to properly salute, and all the basics. I had to ask again if I could join. Finally, I got the go-ahead. I went to get in formation. I figured I better stand in the second line, so I could watch what the cadets were doing in the row ahead of me. But the officer who opened the door for me to join the ROTC program spotted me in the back and said, “Hey! Uh-uh. I want you in the front. You want to be a soldier? You\'ve got to learn the commands just like the rest of them. You’re not going to follow other people. Learn it yourself!” I thought, ""Wow. He’s viewing me like any person, giving dignity to who I am."" I was impressed by that.', '10:17': 'So as the weeks went by, I still didn’t have a uniform. I asked if it would be possible to get one, but I was told it wasn\'t. So I continued on that way, until one day, I was informed that I’d be getting a uniform. ""Please!"" I said, “Really? Why? What changed?” I was told, “We see your motivation, you show up every morning, dedicated, and always gave a 110% effort.” They wanted to give me the uniform. It was remarkable. We went to the warehouse to get my uniform. I assumed I’d just get a uniform and a pair of boots, nothing more. But they filled two duffel bags chock-full of gear: helmet, ammo vest, shovel, sleeping bag -- the whole nine yards. I was astonished. And I have to tell you, each morning that I get up and put on my uniform, I feel privileged. It’s truly an honor to wear the uniform.', '11:10': ""So, moving along, when it came time to train at the garrison base, at first, I was told I couldn’t go. There was concern on the ROTC's part that if the interpreter were to get injured during the training, it would be a liability issue. So we had to figure out all those issues and confusion, but we worked it out, and in the end, they let me go. That's how events were unfolding; I was permitted to do more and more."", '11:31': 'Once, at the garrison base, during one of the training days, a huge Chinook helicopter with its tandem rotors landed right down to us, forcefully spinning exhilaration in the air. All of us cadets were supposed to be getting on board. Everyone was geared up and ready. However, the cadre had decided I wasn’t going to be able to ride the Chinook. They were afraid if the pilot shouted out orders, how would I be able to follow the instructions? I’d potentially cause a disruption. So I had to stand aside, while the others were filing toward the helicopter. I could see the cadre huddled up, discussing, mulling it over. At the last minute, one of them said, “Come on! Get on the helicopter!” I rushed over and got in. It was such a thrill.', '12:13': 'And that was the spirit of learning about and supporting one another that carried over. And since then, I’ve been involved in everything they do, without any separation. This is where my passion lies. I love them. I’ll show you some pictures here.', '12:29': ""Bruin Battalion, Bravo Company -- that’s the name of the group I belong to. The cadre are the officers and sergeants who oversee the ROTC program. In the beginning, you can see, it was a bit of an awkward phase. But once they learned more about me and what I’m capable of doing, there's been tremendous support and unity. The cadets, my fellow peers -- well, when you train and sweat together, you feel the bond of camaraderie right away. A brother- or sisterly cohesiveness makes them like family. In training and military science classes, we learn theories of warfare, how to lead soldiers, how to do reconnaissance, strategies, how to knock out a bunker and land navigation, where you’re finding your way out in the mountains. As far as accommodations, I’ve been provided with interpreters through the National Center on Deafness, NCOD, here at CSUN. And I really have to thank them, because it's hard to find interpreters who are willing to wake up at 4:30 in the morning, or sometimes even 3:30 in the morning."", '13:25': ""That's the officer who emailed me back, saying I think you can have a few classes with us. That's Lieutenant Mendoza. That’s my interpreter there, before class starts. This is a picture from last fall, when we were new to training."", '13:40': ""This is Lieutenant Colonel Phelps, this being his name sign. He's the commanding officer of the entire Bruin Battalion. Every time I see him walk by, it’s rather inspiring. I mean, the way he presents himself, you can see he’s the epitome of a soldier. Plus, he doesn't view me as a deaf person. He looks at my skills and capabilities instead. He’s really pushed for me, and I respect him for all that."", '14:06': 'That’s me during one of the exercises. This is that Chinook helicopter I almost didn’t get on. Every cadet has a mentor. My mentor is Cinatl. He’s a really sharp soldier. He teaches me all the finer points and how to execute them ideally.', '14:24': ""This top picture is when a group of us went to Las Vegas to compete in a test, to see if we could match the German troops' physical training standards. It involved swimming, timed sprints, marksmanship and numerous fitness events. I passed them and satisfied the requirements to be awarded the gold German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge right here. This is one of the sergeants, Sergeant Richardson. I love this guy. He doesn't take baloney from any of us cadets."", '14:54': 'Here I am one morning, when we trekked seven and a half miles with a 40-pound rucksack in less than two hours. Here are a few of my fellow cadets. I\'ve been with them long enough that I’ve developed name signs for them. On the right, here, is Trinidad. I gave him this name sign because he\'s always very sarcastic. He\'s a veteran, having served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The female is Frigo, whose nickname is ""Refrigerator,"" hence her name sign. We’re always competing intellectually in class. The cadet on the end is Jarvy. He\'s a top athlete. I\'ve given him this sign because of the scar he has here.', '15:33': ""Do you know who this is? This is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is the highest-ranking military officer and principal military advisor to President Obama and Secretary of Defense Gates. He gave a talk at UCLA to a full house. Afterwards, I lined up to shake his hand. Having done so, I greeted him, “It’s a great pleasure to meet you.” I signed and my interpreter voiced for me. Admiral Mullen turned to the interpreter and said, “It’s nice to meet you,” addressing the interpreter, who refrained to clarify. He seemed a little confused and just quickly moved on to shake hands with the rest of the soldiers. So I’m not sure whether he really knew that I'm deaf or not."", '16:09': 'So everything’s been moving along, gung-ho, full speed ahead, until two weeks ago, when something occurred. Well, the ROTC has four levels. I’m currently doing the first two levels, which finishes up this May. The third level will begin in the fall. But in order to move up, you need to pass a medical exam. Obviously, I’m deaf, so I’d fail a hearing test. So we sat down, and I was told that if I wanted to continue to the third level, I couldn’t do any of the PT workouts in the morning, nor the Friday lab field trainings, nor the army base trainings. My uniform, I would have to give back as well. I could take the classes, audit them, and that’s all. It really hit me. It was a huge blow.', '17:07': ""Many of the officers and cadets have empathized with this sudden shock of disappointment, and are wondering why this has to be the case. Colonel Phelps has tried to speak with the higher-ups in the chain of command and explain to them that I’m one of the top cadets, having passed all the events and receiving high marks on my exams. But their response is unwavering: policy is policy, and if you’re deaf, you’re disqualified. I know that the cadre has tried to find various ways. They found out that there's a deaf cadet at The Citadel, a military college in South Carolina. That particular cadet will be completing his fourth year there and graduating this May. Yet, he's in the same predicament that I'm in -- unable to join the army because he’s deaf."", '17:55': ""Yet, all of my fellow cadets and the officers have told me not to give up; the policy must change. I was advised to talk with my congressman. And I've brought this issue to Henry Waxman, the district congressman here in LA, to get the ball rolling with his advocacy for my cause. However, I need your help and support to lobby. All of us, you know?"", '18:14': ""If you remember back in US history, African-Americans were told they couldn’t join the military, and now they serve. Women as well were banned, but now they've been allowed. The military has and is changing. Today is our time. Now it’s our turn."", '18:27': 'Hooah!', '18:28': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates, typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, humorous, and urgent.', '01:12': 'The narrator guiding us through these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions loom large, even in the smallest details.', '02:02': 'Like his narrator, Melville was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages around the world in his youth. He published ""Moby Dick"" in 1851, when the United States’ whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s whale populations.', '02:32': 'Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity with whaling is evident over and over again in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge, like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range of religious and cultural traditions.', '03:43': 'The book experiments with writing style as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides.', '04:50': 'A book so wide-ranging has something for everyone. Readers have found religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, social satire, economic analysis, and representations of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through ""Moby Dick’s"" many pages, Melville invites his readers to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thomas Pogge proposes a $6 billion plan to revolutionize the way medications are developed and sold.",0:17:57,17.95,313261,2011-12-18T15:01:24+00:00,"['TEDx', 'economics', 'global issues', 'health']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Türkçe', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '한국어']",Thomas Pogge,Philosopher,"{'00:05': ""I hope you're all healthy, and I hope we will all remain healthy for the indefinite future. But that hope is a little bit unrealistic, and so I've got a second back-up hope. The second back-up hope is that, insofar as we have health problems, we will have good medicines to take care of them. Medicines are very cheap to produce and they're very effective -- much more pleasant, actually, than the alternatives: hospitalization, operations, emergency rooms, the morgue ... None of these are good things. So we should be very grateful that we have pharmacologists around, people who research these things and develop new medicines. And we should be grateful that we have a pharmaceutical industry that supports their activities. But there is a problem, and you can tell from the fact that the pharmaceutical industry isn't well-loved. In fact, in terms of popularity, they rank just about with the tobacco companies and the arms manufacturers."", '01:04': ""So that's the problem I want to talk with you about today. How would you organize the pharmaceutical industry? If we did it all over again, how would you do it? I think we would think of three main principles. The first one is: we want patients to have access to all the important medicines. Remember, these things are very cheap to produce. So everybody in the world should have access to all the important medicines. Secondly, we want innovative activities, the research and development that pharmaceutical companies do, to track the diseases that are the most important, the most damaging. We want them to aim for the greatest health impact. And thirdly, we want the whole system to be efficient. We want as little of the money that goes into the system to go to waste, to go for overhead, for red tape, and so on and so forth. Very simple three points."", '02:02': ""Now what about the existing system? I think it does poorly on all these three counts. First, universal access: forget about it. The vast majority of human beings do not have access to medicines, at least while they're still under patent. There are extremely high markups, and that's the problem. The problem is that even though these medicines are very cheap to produce, they cost a great amount of money during the time that they're under patent, and the reason for that is that rich people can pay a lot of money. Pharmaceutical companies have a temporary monopoly; they price for the rich, they forget about the poor."", '02:41': 'The second problem is innovation. Again, we don\'t focus on the diseases that do the most damage, and that\'s often put into the phrase ""the 10/90 gap."" Ten percent of all the money spent on pharmaceutical research is focusing on diseases that account for ninety percent of the global burden of disease. And vice versa -- ninety percent of the money is spent on diseases that account for only ten percent of the global burden of disease. So there\'s a huge mismatch between where we spend the research money and where the greatest problems are.', '03:18': 'Now, both these problems -- the problem with innovation and the problem with access -- have to do with this: the distribution of money in the world. It\'s extremely unequal. The blue area here is the top quarter of the human population. They have more than ninety percent of the global household income. The bottom half of humanity, on the other hand, has not even three percent of global household income. So if you\'re a pharmaceutical company and you look for profit opportunities, you look at this sort of chart and say, ""Where\'s the money? What am I going to research? Who am I going to provide with medicines?"" And again, that is in the context of there being only one way in which pharmaceutical companies make money under the present system, that is, through patent-protected markups. That\'s how they make their money, through markups. And if you make money through markups, then obviously, you will go to where the people have the most income.', '04:15': 'Now in terms of overall efficiency, the system also does very, very poorly. A lot of money goes for lobbying politicians in order to extend patent periods -- to ""evergreen,"" as it\'s called. Data exclusivity and so on. A lot of money goes for gaming, where brand-name companies pay generic companies to delay entry, for example. A lot of money goes to take our patents in all the different jurisdictions. Money goes – even larger amounts – for litigation. They\'re litigating endlessly -- brand-name company against brand-name company, brand-name company against generic company ... Enormous amounts go there. People say pharmaceutical companies make a lot of profit. Well, yes and no; they do, but a lot of it goes to these wasteful activities. Deadweight losses -- I won\'t even tell you what they are, because it\'s too complicated. But there\'s also wasteful marketing. A lot of the money that pharmaceutical companies make goes into advertising campaigns, trying to win favor with doctors, trying to persuade patients to try this medicine. And these marketing battles, of course, are a pure waste, because what one company spends to get patients over to their drug, another company spends to win them back.', '05:23': 'And then there is counterfeiting in the developing countries. A lot of the drugs there, often more than fifty percent of what\'s sold, are counterfeit drugs, where people say, ""Because the drug is so expensive, I can offer you a cheaper version."" But of course it\'s not the real thing, it\'s either diluted or it\'s completely inert. So on the whole, all the money that is spent on pharmaceuticals -- and it\'s roughly a trillion dollars now, per annum -- much of that money is absolutely going to waste, it\'s not going to where it should be going, namely, to the development of new medicines and to the manufacturing of ones that we already have.', '05:58': ""Now, many people think that the solution to the problem is moral pressure on pharmaceutical companies. And, sure -- pharmaceutical companies have moral obligations, just like we do. When we have to make a choice, often between having a little extra money and saving a human life, we often feel that we have a duty to spend the money and save the life. And why should pharmaceutical companies be any different? But really, it isn't realistic to expect pharmaceutical companies to act as well as you or maybe I might act. And the reason is threefold. One is that pharmaceutical companies are bound to their shareholders. The executive of such a company wouldn't last very long if he gave a lot of money away, or she, for good purposes, and thereby lost money for the shareholders. They would be replaced. Also, pharmaceutical companies stand in fierce competition with one another, and if you do more, if you are nicer than the other company, sooner or later, you'll be driven out of the market. You will not survive. The other company will gain market share. And finally, remember -- the entire industry is dependent for its income on one thing and one thing only: markups. And ultimately, you have to be sustainable. If you spend a lot of money on helping poor people and you don't get paid for it, and you lose this money; you cannot continue with your innovative activities. So for these reasons, it's just unrealistic to expect that pharmaceutical companies will solve the problem on moral grounds."", '07:36': ""Who, then, should solve the problem? I suggest it has to be us. We, citizens and politicians, have to do better in terms of regulating the pharmaceutical industry, focusing them, giving them the right incentives, focusing them on the problems that really matter. The potential gains here are enormous. About one third of all deaths each day, each year, are due to the diseases of poverty in the developing world. Fifty thousand people every day die prematurely from these diseases. And that's not even counting all the diseases that we know only too well in the rich countries: cancer, heart disease and so on. Again, poor people die often much earlier, because they don't have good medical care, including good medicines. And even in rich countries, many patients are not getting the best medicine. That's sometimes due to the fact that insurance companies won't cover it, because the price is so absolutely ridiculous. And it's also due, sometimes, to the fact that doctors and patients are falsely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies."", '08:46': 'So what can we do? How can we change the system? I want to show you a way in which we can better incentivize pharmaceutical innovation and the provision [of] medicines to poor people and rich alike. And that is the Health Impact Fund. The Health Impact Fund is basically opening up the second track with which pharmaceutical innovators can be rewarded for their activities. They have a choice. They can either go with the old system, with patent-protected markups, or they can go with the new system, being rewarded on the basis of the health impact of the medicines that they develop. And with each particular medicine, they have their choice. So they can be partly on one track, partly on the other, with different products.', '09:30': ""Now, how would the Health Impact Fund work? There would be a fixed reward pool every year. We start with maybe six billion dollars, but that can eventually be revved up. Remember that the total money that the world spends on pharmaceuticals is a trillion. So it's a thousand billion; six billion is a drop in the bucket. It's relatively small, but it would work with six billion, and we'd get a lot of bang for the buck if we introduced the Health Impact Fund with just six billion dollars. If you have a product and you want to register it with the Health Impact Fund, you will be rewarded for a period of 10 years. During these 10 years, you get a share of these annual reward pools. That share would be proportional to your share of the health impact achieved by all these registered products. So if your product accounts for eight percent of the health impact of all the registered products, you get eight percent of the reward money that year. That repeats for 10 years, and at the end of the 10 years, your product goes generic, so you basically lose any further income from it. Each year, the health impact from your product would be evaluated, and you would be paid on that basis."", '10:48': ""Now, if you take that reward from the Health Impact Fund, you can't claim the other reward, you can't mark up the price. You have to sell at cost. What does that mean? Well, it doesn't mean that the pharmaceutical company tells us what their cost is; but rather, our preferred way of determining what the real cost is of making a medicine, of manufacturing it, is to ask the registrant to put the production of the medicine out for tender, let generic companies compete for the production, and then the innovator would buy the product from the cheapest supplier and would sell it at that same lowest possible price to patients. So the innovator would make no money at all on selling the product, but would make all its money from the health impact rewards."", '11:38': ""Now, how do we assess the impact of the introduction of a medicine? Well, we assess it relative to the preceding state of the art. So some people, before the medicine came along, had no treatment at all. Now for the first time, they have treatment, because it's cheap; people can afford it. So here, the impact is the difference between being treated and not being treated. In other cases, the new product is better than the old products, and so a person gets switched over to a better product, and we pay for the impact, for the difference the new product makes. If you have a product on the Health Impact Fund and you simply switch somebody from an existing product to another product, to your product, and it's no better, you get no money."", '12:22': ""That's in stark contrast to the existing system, where you get a lot of money for switching somebody from one product to an equal product that is your product. The Health Impact Fund does not pay for that. We quantify health impact in terms of quality-adjusted life years. That method has been around for about 20 years, and it's very easy to explain. Just think of a human life as a kind of plank. It's eighty inches long, one inch high. And when you die prematurely before you reach 80, well, the plank is a little shorter. And if you're sick during the time that you live, the plank is a little bit thinner. And what diseases can nibble away, medicines can restore, or medicines can avert the taking away of these parts. And they get paid for that. That's the method, basically."", '13:13': ""Now, we look – of course, each year, we have to assess. We have to spend a considerable amount of money looking at how these various medicines that are registered with the Health Impact Fund are doing in various countries. And here, statistics is extremely helpful. You all know how exit polling works. This is a similar method. You look for a statistically significant sample, and then try to figure out what the health impact of the medicine is in different locations, in different demographic groups ... And, of course, you look very carefully at the actual world -- this is in contrast to how medicines are today rewarded. Sometimes, there is a reward based on performance, but it's the performance in clinical trials, in the laboratory, if you like, and not the performance in the real world. The Health Impact Fund would look at real-world impact. It would look not just at the quality of a drug, but also at how widely it is distributed, whether the innovator manages to target those patients who can benefit the most, and also, how well the drug is used in the field. So innovators would have much stronger incentives than they do now to make sure that every patient who takes the drug knows exactly how to take it to optimal effect. Today, most packaged inserts are not even translated into local languages, and so it's not surprising that patients don't make the best use of the product."", '14:40': ""Now, how would the financing work? Basically, the Health Impact Fund, as I said, could start with something like six billion dollars. It's not nothing, but it's also not a lot of money, compared to what the world is already spending on pharmaceuticals. So the best way to think of it is as a new way of paying for what we are already paying for, namely, new medicines. You pay with one hand through the tax system, but you get something back with the other hand, because you also get these medicines for cheap. This is not just for poor people -- everybody will have these Health Impact Fund registered medicines at cost, at a very low price."", '15:17': 'One very important hurdle here, politically, is that we have to make sure that we have long-term visibility for innovators, that innovators know that the money is actually there, and so we need governments to fund the Health Impact Fund, because only governments can make predictable commitments for a long period of time. Because the Health Impact Fund registration is voluntary, you basically have a self-adjusting reward rate. As the rate rises too high, innovators will come in and drive the rate down. Conversely, if the rate falls too low, innovators would be reluctant to register, and the rate will recover. So the rate will always be at a reasonable level.', '16:04': ""The Health Impact Fund is beneficial for all parties. It benefits innovators by giving them a new market, and most importantly, by overcoming their public relations problems that we started with. It benefits patients, because patients are much more likely to get the right medicine, and also for these medicines to be developed, the medicines that we most need. And it also benefits governments or taxpayers, if you like, because it creates a permanent source of pharmaceutical innovation that will be here for all future times. It's a kind of machine that always directs pharmaceutical innovation to where we have the greatest problems, maybe for diseases that don't even exist yet. The Health Impact Fund will always channel innovation in the direction where it's most needed."", '16:51': 'Now, we have a little bit of help already. You can see here the number of people who have agreed to help us, but we want your help as well. We want you to join us, maybe to talk with your government to help us with publicity, to help us with your ideas in perfecting the Health Impact Fund scheme. And what we most urgently need for the moment is to start a pilot. The pilot would introduce one medicine into one jurisdiction on the Health Impact Fund model. The innovator would get paid according to the cost of the medicine for the sales, and would then get additional money on the basis of the health impact. Here, we need funding for the rewards, funding for the assessment, and in particular, we need political support to get politicians to support a pilot of that sort.', '17:48': ""If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to write us and contact us at this address."", '17:54': 'Thank you very much.', '17:55': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And, he says, that's how democracy works, too.",0:12:13,12.21666667,311969,2008-11-10T01:00:00+00:00,"['String theory', 'community', 'global issues', 'physics', 'politics', 'science', 'social change']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'Українська', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Lee Smolin,Physicist,"{'00:09': 'So, about three years ago I was in London, and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said, I represent a group of people, and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well. We want to be in the forefront fields, and we want to do it differently. We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.', '00:44': 'Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had. And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here. (Laughter) But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. So, we think a lot about what really makes science work? The first thing that anybody who knows science, and has been around science, is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together as a community, from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.', '01:40': 'So how does it work? Well, my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. And here are some of the ethical principles. I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode. I’m in entertain, amaze mode. (Laughter)', '02:00': 'But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But we’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide, you know, whether I’m right or somebody else is right, are the people in our community in the next generation, in 30 and 50 years. So it’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we’re in, and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere, that makes science work. And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions, I believe, teaches us about democracy. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in.', '03:06': 'And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical. The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres, the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere, where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place. And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place, which was of course, the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in, and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity, embraced Aristotle and blessed it. And the idea is that everything is defined. Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere, the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal, perfect realm, where lives God, who is the ultimate judge of everything.', '04:03': 'So that is both Aristotelian cosmology, and in a certain sense, medieval society. Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. And they were very closely associated. In fact, Newton and Locke were friends. Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand, and a society on the other hand, were closely related.', '04:37': 'And let me show you. In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time. It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space, because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are, but with respect to this absolute notion of space, which for Newton was God.', '05:03': 'Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense, and those are defined with respect to some absolute, abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth, which are independent of what else has happened in the society. Of who else there is, of the history and so forth. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK?', '05:46': 'So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally, liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century, and which is still going on. It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that, something that’s going on right now. And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK. This universe is described by being a network of relationships.', '06:28': 'Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is. And this network of relations is ever-evolving. So we call it a relational universe. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships, your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. And there’s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything. So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory. This is also, if you talk to legal scholars, the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. They’re thinking about the same things. And not only that, they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often. So there’s an interesting discussion going on there. This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.', '07:28': 'So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe, which means that there’s no place to put an explanation for something outside. So in such a relational universe, if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured, like this device here, or that device there, or something beautiful, like all the living things, all of you guys in the room -- ""guys"" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women. (Laughter)', '07:58': 'Then you want to know, you’re a person, you want to know how is it made. And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself. There must be mechanisms of self-organization inside the universe that make things. Because there’s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.', '08:24': 'Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. So it works. But not only that, if you think about how natural selection works, then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe. That is, natural selection works on properties, like fitness, which are about relationships of some species to some other species. Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe, and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.', '09:04': 'So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. And if you push that all the way down, really, it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational. If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life, because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time, keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth, out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.', '09:49': 'In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences, they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way. That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth. And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences, the human sciences, economics, et cetera. At the same time, we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity.', '10:30': 'And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really, of the idea that the universe is made up of relations. 21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas: the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world, on the one hand, and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world, on the other hand. And also, is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology, and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. And what they’re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.', '11:12': 'Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective, a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests, many different agendas, many different individuals, many different points of view. Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded in a network of relationships. Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. And you understand some things better than other things, and because of that there’s a continual jostling and give and take, which is politics. And politics is, in the ideal sense, the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society.', '12:03': 'And I also think that science will never go away and -- I’m finishing on this line. (Laughter) In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In exchange, Adila promises to lead them to the first object of Ethic’s quest, an artifact called the Node of Power.', '01:00': 'Years ago, there was just one furnace-bot. It had a 0 inside its furnace and an unknown, randomly generated serial number. Over time, the original self-replicated to produce more identical furnace-bots. Each child inherited the original’s unknown serial number within its furnace, and had a random, unique serial number of its own inscribed on its shell. The second generation of furnace- bots also self-replicated in the same way, always passing their own serial numbers to their offspring’s furnaces. This continued on for many generations.', '01:41': 'Today, each furnace-bot receives its orders from its parent. So if Ethic can find the original 0 bot and somehow change its instructions, she could take over the entire army, all at once.', '01:56': 'Adila has the perfect solution: a data crystal that she’s been carrying for years, waiting for the right moment to activate it. It contains a program designed to gain control of a bot and give it new instructions. But if it’s uploaded to any furnace- bot other than the original, the 0 bot will override the instructions and destroy the data crystal in the process.', '02:22': 'The feeding is just a few minutes away, and there’s only one chance to get this right. Fortunately, Hedge’s ability to store data can help. In programming, a piece of information gets stored in something called a variable. Variables are basically containers that hold onto numbers, words, or other values.', '02:44': 'How does Ethic program Hedge to find the original 0 bot as quickly as possible?', '02:51': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '02:55': 'Here’s a hint.', '02:57': 'Programs can be written to have as many variables as you need, but you can solve this problem with just one. Hedge can use it to store a serial number and replace it with a new one as often as he needs.', '03:11': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '03:16': 'A key insight here is that Hedge doesn’t need to map out the entire set of relationships to find the original furnace-bot. If, for example, he gets lucky and picks the original one right away, he’ll be done. But if he starts with any other bot, he can still find a path that leads straight back to the 0-bot by following a simple set of instructions.', '03:40': 'To help craft them, let’s first simplify the problem. Let’s say there were only three furnace-bots; a parent and two children, but you don’t know which is which. You could have Hedge pick one at random and look inside its furnace.', '03:55': 'Now, you know the family tree looks like this. If the number inside the furnace is a 0, you’ve found the parent. If not, then no matter which child you chose, it must have the parent’s serial number in its furnace. So in this scenario, you’re guaranteed to find the parent in one or two moves.', '04:16': 'In actuality, there are many furnace-bots, and you don’t know how many generations there are nor what the family tree looks like. But you don’t need to, because Hedge can just keep repeating the same sequence of actions until he gets to the original.', '04:32': 'How? With a loop. Hedge can pick any bot at random, look inside its furnace, and store that serial number as a variable. Then he’ll begin the following loop that will repeat until the stored variable equals 0, the furnace number of the original bot: 1. Find the bot whose shell serial number matches the stored number. 2. Look inside its furnace. 3. Store that new number, overwriting the old one.', '05:05': 'Once the loop ends, we’ll know that Hedge has found the 0 bot, so he should upload the control program.', '05:12': 'So here’s what happens:', '05:13': 'Hedge only takes 5 repetitions to find the original: robot 733 has the 0 in its furnace. In a blink of a mechanical eye, the program spreads through the entire army, and Adila takes control. She has the furnace-bots give off theatrical bouts of flame to hide the fact that they’re now secretly safe-guarding all of that artistic output.', '05:38': 'Now that Ethic’s delivered the furnace-bots, Adila honors her end of the deal. She leads Ethic and Hedge to the location of the first artifact, the Node of Power. There, one thing is immediately clear: they’ll have to steal it.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath, and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena, or a gymnasium."", '01:04': ""So obviously there's a massive housing gap, and this really upset me, because academia tells you after a major disaster, there's typically about an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover, start the recovery process, but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes 45 to 60 days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up. Before that time, people are left to their own devices."", '01:29': 'So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap. This actually became my creative obsession. I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem.', '01:46': ""So I started sketching. Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this, and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form, I started sketching digitally on the computer, but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there. I started experimenting, making models, talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback, and refining, and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years."", '02:11': ""Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) — and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs, but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster. It can be put up in any environment, from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields, because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools."", '02:41': ""Now, at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit, which is just the individual shelter module. And though it's light, light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around, and it actually sleeps four people."", '02:55': ""And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout, or you can circle the wagons, essentially, and form these circular pods out of them, which give you this semi-private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units."", '03:12': 'Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters, because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people are crammed on these cots inside. Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.', '03:29': ""So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there, so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving, so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location. The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control, or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together, which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces, so now this same kit of parts, this same unit can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom, or an office, a living space and secure storage."", '04:31': 'Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real? So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, ""Here, take it, for free."" But I was quickly told that, ""Boy, our government doesn\'t really work like that."" (Laughter) Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government, but then I was told, ""Son, our government looks to private sector for things like this."" Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn\'t want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti.', '05:16': 'Now, I wasn\'t just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.) So I decided, kind of told myself, ""Oh yeah? Watch this. I\'ll do it myself."" (Laughter) Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers. And we found through this whole process, we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia, and if his body language is any indication, that\'s the owner — (Laughter) — of what it\'s like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer, you\'ve got to see what happens here. (Laughter)', '06:00': 'But G.S. Industries was fantastic. They actually built three prototypes for us by hand. So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide. And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us. Now, a funny thing started happening. Other people started to believe in what we were doing, and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. So now we had a hangar space to work in, and prototypes to demo with.', '06:36': ""So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements, been awarded one patent, filed our second patent, talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews, and then started talking to some other people who requested information, this little group called the United Nations. And on top of that, now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps, mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. So, in closing, on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet. Hopefully very soon we will be there, because we are destined, obsessed with making it real. Thank you.

But that's not true: white people have been given a headstart and ongoing advantages due to the color of their skin, while people of color suffer from equally arbitrary disadvantages, says scholar and activist Peggy McIntosh. She explains what led her to recognize her privilege — and how it can be used by those with power to ensure a fairer life for others.",,,308419,2020-06-04T19:18:13+00:00,"['race', 'inequality', 'education', 'social change', 'activism']",['English'],Peggy McIntosh,"Anti-racism activist, scholar","{'0:00': '(Music) (Applause) I imagine a hypothetical line of social justice. A hypothetical line — an imaginary line of social justice that is parallel to the floor, also parallel to the Earth. And on this imaginary line of social justice, things feel fair. Below it, one can be pushed down either as a member of a group or an individual, through bullying, teasing, being stereotyped, having prejudices against one or one\'s group, being a survivor of genocide, being a scapegoat, being a discarded person. What I study, is what happens above the hypothetical line of social justice. And in school, I was never taught to even notice this realm. Above the hypothetical line, one can be pushed up, believed, thought worthy of responsibility, considered to be responsible with money, considered to be capable of doing the school work, or any other kind of work. One can be seen as representative of the best. That\'s privilege. Above the hypothetical line of justice, one has more than one deserved because of circumstances of birth and other people\'s positive projections onto one. And below it is disadvantage. That is unearned disadvantage. And I believe everybody in this room has a combination of both experiences. Having more than we actually earned, and having less than we\'ve actually earned. And I didn\'t used to think this way. I was raised, as many of you have been, on the myth of meritocracy, which is, the unit of society is the individual. And whatever the individual ends up with at death, is what that individual worked for and earned and deserved and wanted. Well, it isn\'t true. These privileged systems which locate us above and below the hypothetical line of social justice were invented, and we were born into them. And we all know both sides. And that\'s a reason for compassion about the sadness of having been born into systems that gave us such — and here I quote the poet Adrienne Rich, such different politics of location. I came to notice privilege because I noticed male privilege. And then I noticed, in parallel fashion, white privilege. And both of these things were very distressing. I hated learning about privilege systems. But I found I had to, to explain my life. Three years in a row, men and women in a seminar I was leading at Wellesley College, Wellesley Centers for Women, got into a bad relation with each other in the spring of each year. We had monthly seminars. They were great. The men and the women were all professors from different colleges in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New England. And we were talking about quite a difficult subject, but fascinating. How to bring materials on women into all the liberal arts curriculum, in every field？ So how to bring women\'s history into political science, economics, sociology, psychology, literature, music, art, PT, all of the technical fields as well. And the men were our allies. They were very brave. They had taken a fair amount of flak on their campuses for coming to a women\'s college to talk about women\'s studies, and bringing it to the main curriculum, not keeping it isolated. These were great men. And very nice men. And yet, three years running with different groups of men, there was a falling out that I realized as I looked through my notes, took this form as a natural occurrence in the spring. Toward the spring of the year in these monthly seminars, once we all trusted each other pretty well, the women would just raise this question. ""Can\'t we do some of this teaching about women in the introductory courses that the students take first year in college, the freshman courses?"" And the men, to a person, every year, said, ""We\'re sorry. You know, this is a great seminar, we love doing this work, but you can\'t put anything on women into the freshman courses."" I was a prodigious note taker, and I found in my notes one man had said, ""When you\'re trying to lay the foundation blocks for knowledge in those introductory courses, you can\'t put in soft stuff."" Well, thanks a lot. （Laughter） And I remember my first thought was, he doesn\'t understand labor pains. (Laughter) But also, let me ask you, exactly who here has a truly soft mother? (Laughter) And in that comment, he was including women in general. But he was a very nice man. I had a comment written down from another year when the women also asked, how can we get this material into the first year courses? And a very, very nice man said, in an explanatory way, ""See, that first year, the students are trying to figure out what will be their major. That\'s their discipline. And if you want students to think in a disciplined way, you can\'t put in extras."" Now every one of these very nice men is born of a woman. And she has become extra in his head. Together with, lots of them were married to women. His wife, his daughter, his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts, they\'ve all become extra. And I\'m wondering, how have they become extra, and this is such a nice man? And then I was rescued from my dilemma, which was, I had to choose. I had to choose whether these are nice men, and I knew they were, and brave. Or whether they were oppressive. And I was experiencing them as oppressive. And in the dilemma of thinking I had to choose, I was rescued by remembering that, back in 1980, black women in the Boston area had written a number of essays to the effect that white women are oppressive to work with. Not just some white women. White women were oppressive to work with. I thought, oh dear. Now, I remember how I responded to those essays. My first response, the ""oh dear"" response was ""I don\'t see how they can say that about us! I think we\'re nice."" (Laughter) And my second response, which is mortifying to admit, but this is how racist I was in 1980. I thought, I especially think we\'re nice if we work with them. You can hear the white superiority there. And as I recalled my responses to reading those essays — by now it was six years later — I thought, oh, I hope my attitudes didn\'t show. I hope I was so nice I covered them over. But after struggling with that for a couple of years, I said yes, I was oppressive to work with. And my niceness didn\'t cover my basic racial superiority assumption. And then I thought, maybe niceness has nothing to do with it. And that\'s what I believe today. Niceness has nothing at all to do with this whole matter of being oppressive to others. I found that now I went back to the men, these are nice men, but they were very good students of what they were taught, and what I was taught also. Which is men have knowledge, men make more knowledge, men publish knowledge, men profess knowledge as professors. Men run all the major research universities, and men run all of the university presses. And they have taken in, as I had, too, the idea that knowledge is male, and men are knowers. And then I realized why my husband has trouble asking for directions when we\'re lost. (Laughter) It\'s the identity he was taught is that he is a knower. And I thought, in parallel fashion, and this is sickening to realize, it\'s messing up my world picture that I deserved everything I\'ve got. Now, I was taught that whites have knowledge. Whites make more knowledge, whites publish knowledge, and whites profess knowledge as professors. And whites run the big research universities. And whites run the university presses. And I drank in the idea that knowledge is white, and white people are knowers. And to this day, in my major project, the SEED project, whose core staff is nine people of color and five whites, I will, unless I check myself, second guess, and doubt, and judge everything said — every sentence, every word, said by my colleagues of color. I will do it because my hard drive is wired with the white privilege that I am a knower. And among my nine colleagues of color, the level of knowledge and understanding, and intelligence isn\'t as high as it is in me. But, luckily I have alternative software I can install. And when I install the alternative software, I realize these people have been my major teachers. And I have so much to learn from them. They are not defective variants of whites. They are my major teachers. So once I began to see that, it was churning my stomach to realize that I had white privilege that I hadn\'t earned, but it was putting me ahead. Then I realized why, at the Wellesley Centers for Women, I could get big grants my colleagues of color couldn\'t. Because I had the knowledge system on my side as a white person. And I realized also the foundations which gave us money, or the federal government, it was then — they still are in general — run by whites. And I was trusted, then, with money — with big pots of money, because I was white. Not because I had earned that trust. So having seen those things, I asked myself, what else do I have that I didn\'t earn because I\'m white, when I compare myself with African-American colleagues here in my building at Wellesley Centers for Women. And my conscious mind said, nothing. So I asked again, on a daily basis, what do I get, beside the money system and the knowledge system helping me out, that my colleagues of color can\'t count on? And once again, my mind, with the three degrees, and the good grades, it said, nothing. But I couldn\'t believe it. I thought I\'d seen something huge and began to name it white privilege. Unearned advantage that came because of my racial/ethnic status or projected worth. So I decided I had to pray on it. And I went to sleep one night — angrily, really. It wasn\'t the usual prayer in which you ask for something, I was demanding. I said, if I have anything I didn\'t earn by contrast of my black friends, except the money system and the knowledge system, show me. And in the middle of the night, along came an example. I switched on the light — it woke me up of course — and I wrote it down. And over the next three months, 46 elements of unearned advantage came to me. And they\'re in my paper, ""White Privilege, Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,"" and my paper, ""White Privilege and Male Privilege,"" a personal account of coming to see correspondences through work in women\'s studies. And then I decided, because this work was spreading in many places, I needed to help with the matter of white guilt. I don\'t believe we can be guilty, or ashamed, or blamed for being born into systems both above and below the hypothetical line of social justice. They\'re arbitrary. They have to do with projections onto us, owing to our neighborhood, or our parents\' relation to money, or our body type, or our hair, or our language of origin. They have to do with our region of the country — these projections that are put on to us, and the rewards or punishments relate to our sex, to our gender, to our sexual orientation, to our race, to our ethnicity, to our parents\' reputation, to stereotypes people may have about the kinds of group we were born into. I don\'t think blame, shame, or guilt are relevant to the arbitrariness of our placement in privilege systems. But I decided, beside the metaphor I originally used of white privilege as an invisible knapsack I can\'t see or feel on my back, but it\'s filled with assets that I can count on cashing in each day — beside that, and the assets include the equivalent of freeze-dried food, emergency blanket, flashlight, maps, code books, guide books, letters of introduction, even, maybe, blank checks. But beside that, I decided to put a second metaphor. And that\'s the metaphor of white privilege as a bank account that I was given. I didn\'t ask for it, and I can\'t be blamed for it, but I can decide to put it in the service of weakening the system of white privilege. That is my energy. That is my financial commitment. That is my daily life. And it\'s been transformative to use my bank account of white privilege to weaken the system of white privilege. It has absolutely transformed my life to be in work that feels right. And it\'s not based on guilt. I don\'t know exactly the wording for it, but I I found that, when I put my white privilege in this service of weakening white privilege, the bank account keeps refilling, because I get the benefit of the doubt. So the cops arresting me for speeding tend to let me off. I get the benefit of the doubt because I\'m a little old lady with white hair. (Laughter) And my papers are in order, and my voice is soft. So I get let off. It\'s not fair. But I don\'t want to say, ""Officer, officer, arrest me!"" (Laughter) Because that\'ll put our insurance up. (Laughter) But every day in every way, bank account of white privilege refills, and I get the benefit of the doubt. It has been transformative to use the power I did not know, I was never taught that I had, in the service of kinder, fairer, and more compassionate life for everyone. Thank you.

Or are aliens living somewhere else in the Milky Way? But there is one thing I believe about space: Space is trying to kill me. Space isn't out to get me personally. It's also trying to kill you and everybody else. Think about it. Space doesn't naturally have what we need to survive when we travel there: no air, it's too hot or too cold, no ozone to protect us from those nasty UV rays, either. This all sounds bad, but what can space really do to me if I stay on Earth? What we need to understand is that objects in space can cause people to think their days are numbered, even when there are events on Earth that can hurt or kill us before something from space does. So, what are the odds that one of these objects will really affect Earth and you and me in our lifetime? Well, we can take what we know about the universe to try and figure that out. You might have heard stories about asteroids hitting the Earth. That would be pretty bad. Scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs. Sounds like something we should worry about, right? Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space and see them coming using complex computer models to predict the deadly rock's path. For a while, the reported odds that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036 were once 1 in 625. But, after updating their data, astronomers now say the chances are extremely low. Okay, what about the sun? Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares or the sun dying out, which would cause Earth to freeze. Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years. So, in 3 to 5 billion years, if people still exist on Earth, they'll have to deal with that. But today, well, we're safe. Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth, but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet blocks most of that radiation. The radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis. Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment, but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim. Okay, what about that supermassive black hole in the middle of our galaxy? What happens to Earth, and us, when it pulls us in? After all, it is supermassive. Nope, not going to happen. That's one big object that can't bother us. How can we be so sure? Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way while the nearest supermassive black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth. That means we aren't on that black hole's menu. So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you even after what I've told you so far? I think I've even convinced myself that odds are really good that space and the objects up there won't kill me after all. But I'll probably keep looking up just to make sure nothing is headed my way.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When is an idea worth spreading? Is an idea good by itself? Can inappropriate context ruin an idea? Can a simple idea work within a very motivating context? Here I have a piano. And within music there are ideas. For example, if I play this, (Music) I can see ladies in the audience sighing because it is a wonderful idea. Who doesn\'t know Beethoven\'s \'Fur Elise\'? Now, this idea needs a context. On the piano, the context is played by the left hand. The left hand plays this. (Music) Perfect. I have an idea and a context. Then, I just have to put them together, So it sounds like this. (Music) Something is wrong. You may notice that this (Music) can\'t be Beethoven. It is wrong because the melody, the idea, (Music) is in one tone but the context is in another. (Music) This happens often in real life too. You feel like you have an idea but the context is in a different tone. If I take the context and do this. (Music) I change it (Music) and I put it in the same frequency and tone as the idea. (Music) Then, everything starts to work. But this example is easy, if the idea is as wonderful as Beethoven\'s idea. But imagine that a boy says to me ""Hi Fefe"" -- they call me Fefe, I don\'t know why. ""Hi Fefe. I want to be a composer and I have composed my first piece, this is the idea I have. (Music) And I say, ""Yes, yes, very nice."" It reminds me of the story of the father that makes his son study violin and takes him to a friend and says: ""Look, Juan, listen how my son plays the violin."" The son plays the violin... very badly. (Laughter) And he says: ""what do you think about the execution?"" ""Well, executing him is excessive, a couple of slaps would be enough."" (Laughter) But, that wasn\'t the case. (Applause) Without going that far it occurred to me to say ""If this is your idea... (Music) you\'d better do something else, son"". But, if that child was Frédéric Chopin, a Polish composer of the nineteenth century, he could have written (Music) And with this very simple idea, which could deserve a slap, he composed a prelude, ""Prelude in E Minor"" a wonderful piece that is played in piano recitals everywhere. So we had these two examples. But, what happens if I say I have an idea, I\'m going to be a composer, and this is my idea. (Note) Ha! (Laughter) What do you think? I hear laughs. But be careful, because laughter can be disrespectful because this note, (Note) this idea, can be repeated. (Two notes) Ha! It starts to sound different. I can even change the rhythm -- rhythm is the duration of a note. I can do this. (Notes) If I am Tom Jobim, for example, a Brazilian composer, I can do this. (Music) This is ""One-note Samba."" you may have noticed why it\'s called that. (Laughter) Now, this one-note samba makes the most of the idea of one idea - the redundancy is intended - reduced to the expression of a single note. But, speaking of reducing ideas, there is one example which is pretty average. The most interesting example of synthesizing an idea was invented by John Cage, who composed a piece for piano called ""4 Minutes 33 Seconds."" And in this case, to be faithful to the piece, I\'m going to use a score if you don\'t mind. And I\'m going to play just a fragment, because, you know, time is... (Laughter) We could keep going, but I think you get the picture. (Applause) There must be, perhaps, a more intense version somewhere, but it\'s less interesting for an orchestra. You can listen to it if you want. (Laughter) And, speaking of ideas in music, I\'m thinking, to what extent is an idea our own? Really our own. And when does an idea begin to be shared? There is an aria by Mozart from the Don Giovanni opera --Don Juan-- it\'s the story of a man who is a womanizer and even though he seduces one woman after another, he is never satisfied. This aria is ""Là ci darem la mano"" where Don Giovanni sings to one of his lovers ""come I\'ll give you my hand, we will go far away, you will accept this, etc."" It sounds like this. (Music) Là ci darem la mano, Là mi dirai di sì: Vedi, non è lontano... \'El Reino del Reves\' (Spanish nursery rhyme) (Laughter) It\'s very similar to that nursery rhyme! (Applause) Now, this example is less clear because we can think has this idea been done before? Is it new? A composer, we could say, found things before they were lost. This is a euphemism for stealing. This composer, (Laughter) let\'s say he is a popular composer, ran out of inspiration. He didn\'t show inspiration in other work either, but in this case he wanted inspiration, so he searched his old jukebox and his old vinyl discs. To the youngest among you, back then, we didn\'t have pendrives or CDs. We had vinyl discs, you know. And he played this vinyl disc in search for inspiration; it was a tango. (Music) It was broken. It didn\'t work. So he threw it away and looked for another and he read on the cover ""Muzio Clementi"", ""Sonatina en sol mayor"". Who knows Muzio Clementi? Well, Muzio Clementi was a great composer. He was much less famous than his genius deserved. He was Beethoven\'s teacher, among others. And in the third movement of that sonata - the one that the composer was using for inspiration - he wrote this. (Music) But the composer thought: ""I don\'t like this. Something is wrong."" ""And, what is this button for?"" There was a button, metronome, that had three numbers: 33, 45 and 78. (Laughter) It was set in 78. So he thought: ""This is wrong. Let me put it in 45."" (Music) ""No. I don\'t like this either."" ""Let\'s see what happens in 33."" (Music) I have a hit! (Music) And who, who\'s going to complain? (Applause) Muzio Clementi died more than 300 years ago. Who is going to remember? Who knows? Only the idiots who go and listen to TED talks and investigate those things. (Laughter) Now, in an unprecedented effort because the sonatina doesn\'t end there. (Music) It goes on... (Music) This is the next hit. It says: ""When I\'m feeling happy, when I\'m feeling honey. All I have to do is steal another tune"". (Laughter) Done! Now I just have to publish it. And we all get rich. Now, I once heard -- whilst we\'re on the topic of ideas -- I heard Alejandro Dolina say that the genius was not the guy who invented the first phone. The genius was the one who invented the second phone. Because one phone alone is not worth it. (Laughter) In the case of ideas it\'s the same. Some composers have great ideas. But the really brilliant composers are those who find the second phone for each idea. And that is why one of my favorite and most popular composers is undoubtedly Mozart. We were listening to him before - I mean, I quoted him before - in ""Là ci darem la mano."" He composed a Sonata in C Major a piano sonata that could be used to tell a story. And the idea sounds like this: it begins when we are born (Music) and then we go to kindergarten. (Music) We play with other children with our friends. Then we grow older, we finish school - elementary school - and then, all of a sudden there she is. Ahh! When I first met my wife, I asked her - I just met her and, playing the piano, I asked - ""Do you like music?"" She said: ""Yes, but never mind, keep playing."" (Laughter) She appears... (Music) All is well. ""Would you like to go out?"" ""Yes!"" ""To have a cup of coffee... have a great time together."" There we are, very happy. And this is the time when you have to ask: ""Do you like me being a musician?"" ""Yes!"" ""Do you like me being a bohemian, not interested in things?"" ""Love it"" ""Sign it!"" (Laughter) Because I want to have that on the record, because that... (Music) is about to end. ""How nice. How about living together? How about getting married?"" ""OK!"" ""Let\'s fix a date."" (Music) And then the marriage begins... Oh! (Laughter) This is Mozart, eh? It\'s Mozart. (Applause) This is Mozart. (Music) The kids. Work. The house. (Music) And then... Is this the life I want? (Music) All you want is to go back to the beginning when you were a child (Music) Ah! There we are -- This is like the beginning. But the beginning was like this. (Music) And now it\'s like this. (Music) It\'s not the same... it\'s alike but it\'s not the same. Now we have gained a few kilos, lost some hair... The other day I was sitting and my son said to me: ""Dad, you are getting bald."" (Laughter) And I said: ""It\'s true."" because now we\'re going through the same thing. (Music) But we still enjoy it, right? And you are looking forward - the kids are grown up - to meeting that person that you once knew... (Music) and you feel that you have found her. Ah! But, how was she before? (Music) And now she is... (Music) That\'s okay, it\'s close enough. (Laughter) What can you do? I\'ve gained some weight too... (Laughter) ""Will we play? Will we go out? ""No, let\'s stay here."" (Laughter) ""Dr. House isn\'t that bad"" (Laughter) ""And Utilísima is so useful, it has recipes and everything! (Laughter) ""I like that roast beef with potatoes."" And I will end there. (Applause) And now that we\'re talking about ideas in music that go together, and since we all trust each other and won\'t tell anyone else I propose that together, we write a hit. Let\'s write a song that could sell and then we\'ll distribute the profits. Nobody will know. But, to make a hit we need an idea. An idea could have three notes. There are 7 musical notes, right? C, D, E, F, G, A, B. There are some alterations: flat, sharp... But that doesn\'t matter. Together, let\'s create an idea with three notes. Now, over here, give me a note. C, D, E, F, G, A, B? A note? F. F, perfect, F. F. F, what a good idea! People will say, F! Come on! F! F. And you over there? Give me a note. OK. OK. Let\'s say B. Flat? Sharp? Just B? Flat. B flat. It\'s getting there, eh? Getting there. Let\'s see over there, another note? D. Flat? Sharp? D flat. Now. We already have the idea! And in order to make it a hit, - because that\'s all we want - to be able to sell it very well, and make a lot of money, we have to make something popular. A ""bolero"" for example, what do you think? (Music) Ah! But - sorry, I have to make the cameramen move a bit - You know what? If this is a bolero, we need lyrics. Boleros have words. This idea needs words. What word can we use? Let\'s see. You know what? I\'m going to tell you something that I learned after many years of studying. If the idea has three notes the text needs three syllables. If you tell me ""TEDxRíodelaPlata"" there is no way I could do it. Let\'s see, Max? Could you give me a word? What? Give me a word for a bolero? We are creating a hit here. ""So you were..."" I was playing the piano Give me something to make a hit. Three notes, one word. This is a bolero. ""Ambition"" That\'s it: Ambition! Ambition to love you, to have you ambition for whatever you want! So, let\'s do something. You remember the idea, right? (Music) Let\'s see if we can sing this. Please sing ""Ambition"" in these three notes. (Singing) Ambition. (Laughter) We have a problem here. Let\'s see. Breathe properly, let\'s do it again. (Singing) Ambition. Again. (Singing) Ambition. Great! I\'m going to fill in the gaps but when the theme comes back we\'ll sing it loudly. Ready? Let\'s go. We begin with Ambition (Singing) Ambition. Stop, stop, stop. Now go! Right now. (Singing) Ambition. Louder, louder. (Singing) Ambition. And... (Singing) Ambition. And to make it a real hit, it needs to end with an ovation because, people will think... We\'re recording this live, right now, so you can buy it at the exit, you can digitalize it. So, over here. Let\'s do a rehearsal of the ovation like this. (Applause) Everyone over there. (Applause) More, more, right at the back! Great! Very good! You\'ll do that. And you begin to sing, as the applause grows you stop singing and start clapping. And that\'s how we finish this TEDxRíodelaPlata. Let\'s see how it goes, eh? Everybody sing, okay? When I give the signal, we give an ovation. We are recording this, so, be serious. And... three... (Singing) Ambition. (Singing) Ambition. (Singing) Ambition. (Applause) (Singing) Ambition. (Applause) (Music) (Ovation)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You've probably guessed what they are -- data and history. Right? So, I'm not a historian. I'm not going to give you a definition of history. But let's think instead of history within a framework."", '00:28': ""So, when we're making history, or when we're creating historical documents, we're taking things that have happened in the past, and we're stitching them together into a story. So let me start with a little bit of my own story. Like anybody my age who works creatively with computers, I was a popular, socially well-adjusted young man --"", '00:48': '(Laughter)', '00:49': ""And sporty! Sporty young man. And like a lot of people my age in the type of business that I'm in, I was influenced tremendously by Apple. But notice my choice of logo here, right? The Apple on the left, not the Apple on the right. I'm influenced as much by the Apple on the right as the next person, but the Apple on the left -- I mean, look at that logo! It's a rainbow. It's not even in the right order!"", '01:20': '(Laughter)', '01:21': ""That's how crazy Apple was."", '01:24': '(Laughter)', '01:25': ""But I don't want to talk too much about the company. I'll start talking about a machine, though. How amazing it is to think about this. I go back and I think about this. Wednesday -- one Wednesday, when I was about 12 years old, I didn't have a computer. On Thursday, I had a computer. Can you imagine that change? It's so drastic. I can't even think about anything that could change our lives that way. But I'm actually not even going to talk about the computer. I'm going to talk about a program that came loaded on that computer. And it was build by, not the guy on the left, but the guy on the right. Does anybody know who the guy on the right is? Nobody ever knows the answer to this question. This is Bill Atkinson. And Bill Atkinson was responsible for tons of things that you see on your computer every day. But I want to talk about one program that Bill Atkinson wrote, called HyperCard. Someone's cheering over there."", '02:23': '(Laughter)', '02:24': 'HyperCard was a program that shipped with the Mac, and it was designed for users of the computer to make programs on their computers. Crazy idea today. And these programs were not the apps that we think about today, with their large budgets and their big distribution. These were small things, people making applications to keep track of their local basketball team scores or to organize their research or to teach people about classical music or to calculate weird astronomical dates. And then, of course, there were some art projects. This is my favorite one. It\'s called ""If Monks Had Macs,"" and it\'s a nonlinear kind of exploratory environment. I thank the stars for HyperCard all of the time. And I thank the stars for putting me in this era where I got to use HyperCard. HyperCard was the last program to ship on a public computer that was designed for the users of the computer to make programs with it. If you talked to the people who invented the computer and you told them there would be a day, a magical day, when everybody had a computer but none of them knew how to program, they would think you were crazy.', '03:39': 'So let\'s skip forward a few years. I\'m starting my career as an artist, and I\'m building things with my computer, small-scale things, investigating things like the growth systems of plants. Or, in this example, I\'m building a simulated economy in which pixels are trading color with one another, trying to investigate how these types of systems work, and just kind of having fun. And then this project led me to start working with data. So I\'m building graphics like this, which compare ""communism"" -- the frequency of usage of the word ""communism"" in the New York Times -- to ""terrorism,"" at the top. You see ""terrorism"" kind of appears as ""communism"" is going away. And with these graphics, I was really interested in the aesthetic of the graphs. This is Iran and Iraq. It reads like a clock. It\'s called a ""timepiece graph."" This is another timepiece graph, overlaying ""despair"" over ""hope."" And there\'s only three times -- actually, it\'s ""crisis"" over ""hope"" -- there\'s only three times when ""crisis"" eclipses ""hope."" We\'re in the middle of one of them right now. But don\'t think about that too much.', '04:45': '(Laughter)', '04:47': ""And finally, the culmination of this work with the New York Times data a few years ago was the attempt to combine an entire year's news cycle into a single graphic. So these graphics actually show us a full year of news, all the people, and how they're connected into a single graphic."", '05:04': 'And from there, I started to be interested again in more active systems. Here\'s a project called ""Just Landed,"" where I\'m looking at people tweeting on Twitter. ""Hey! I just landed in Hawaii!"" -- you know, how people just casually try to sneak that into their Twitter conversation. ""I\'m not showing off. Really. But I did just land in Hawaii."" And then I\'m plotting those people\'s trips, in the hopes that maybe we can use social network and the data that it leaves behind to provide a model of how people move, which would be valuable to epidemiologists, among other people. And, more fun -- this is a similar project, looking at people saying ""Good morning"" to each other all around the world. Which taught me, by the way, that it is true that people in Vancouver on the West Coast wake up much later and say ""Good morning"" much later than the people on the East Coast, who are more adventurous. Here\'s a more useful -- maybe -- project, where I took all the information from the Kepler Project and tried to put it into some visual form that made sense to me.', '06:01': ""And I should say that everything I've shown you up to now -- these are all things that I just did for fun. It may seem weird, but this comes back from HyperCard. I'm building tools for myself. I may share them with a few other people, but they're for fun, they're for me. So, all these tools I show you kind of occupy this weird space somewhere between science, art and design. That's where my practice lies. And still today, from my experience with HyperCard, what I'm doing is building visual tools to help me understand systems."", '06:34': ""So today, I work at the New York Times. I'm the data artist in residence at the New York Times. And I've had an opportunity at the Times to work on a variety of really interesting projects, two of which I'm going to share with you today. The first one, I've been working on in conjunction with Mark Hansen. Mark Hansen is a professor of statistics at UCLA. He's also a media artist. And Mark came to the Times with a very interesting question to what may seem like an obvious problem: When people share content on the internet, how does that content get from person A to person B? Or maybe, person A to person B to person C to person D? We know that people share content in the internet, but what we don't know is what happens in that gap between one person to the other. So we decided to build the tool to explore that, and this tool is called Cascade."", '07:23': ""If we look at these systems that start with one event that leads to other events, we call that structure a cascade. And these cascades actually happen over time. So we can model these things over time. Now, the New York Times has a lot of people who share our content, so the cascades do not look like that one, they look more like this. Here's a typical cascade. At the bottom left, the very first event. And then as people are sharing the content from one person to another, we go up in the Y axis, degrees of separation, and over on the X axis, for time. So we're able to look at that conversation in a couple of different views: this one, which shows us the threads of conversation, and this one, which combines that stacked view with a view that lets us see the threads."", '08:14': ""Now, the Times publishes about 7,000 pieces of content every month. So it was important for us, when we were building this tool, to make it an exploratory one, so that people could dig through this vast terrain of data. I think of it as a vehicle that we're giving people to traverse this really big terrain of data. So here's what it really looks like, and here's the cascade playing in real time. I have to say, this was a tremendous moment. We had been working with canned data, fake data, for so long, that when we saw this for the first moment, it was like an archaeologist who had just dusted off these dinosaur bones. We discovered this thing, and we were seeing it for the first time, these sharing structures that underlie the internet. And maybe the dinosaur analogy is a good one, because we're actually making some probabilistic guesses about how these things link. We're looking at some of these pieces and making some guesses, but we try to make sure that those are as statistically rigorous as possible."", '09:15': 'Now tweets, in this case, they become parts of stories. They become parts of narratives. So we are building histories here, but they\'re very short-term histories. And sometimes these very large cascades are the most interesting ones, but sometimes the small ones are also interesting. This is one of my favorites. We call this the ""Rabbi Cascade."" It\'s a conversation amongst rabbis about this article in the New York Times, about the fact that religious workers don\'t get a lot of time off. I guess Saturdays and Sundays are bad days for them to take off. So, in this cascade, there\'s a group of rabbis having a conversation about a New York Times story. One of them has the best Twitter name ever -- he\'s called ""The Velveteen Rabbi.""', '09:59': '(Laughter)', '10:01': ""But we would have never found this if it weren't for this exploratory tool. This would just be sitting somewhere, and we would have never been able to see that. But this exercise of taking single pieces of information and building narrative structures, building histories out of them, I find tremendously interesting."", '10:20': ""You know, I moved to New York about two years ago. And in New York, everybody has a story that surrounds this tremendously impactful event that happened on September 11 of 2001. And my own story with September 11 has really become a more intricate one, because I spent a great deal of time working on a piece of the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan. The central idea about the 9/11 Memorial is that the names in the memorial are not laid out in alphabetical order or chronological order, but instead, they're laid out in a way in which the relationships between the people who were killed are embodied in the memorial. Brothers are placed next to brothers, coworkers are placed together. So this memorial actually considers all of these myriad connections that were part of these people's lives."", '11:14': ""I worked with a company called Local Projects to work on an algorithm and a software tool to help the architects build the layout for the memorial: almost 3,000 names and almost 1,500 of these adjacency requests, these requests for connection -- so a very dense story, a very dense narrative, that becomes an embodied part of this memorial. Working with Jake Barton, we produce the software tool, which allows the architects to, first of all, generate a layout that satisfied all of those adjacency requests, but then second, make little adjustments where they needed to to tell the stories that they wanted to tell. So this memorial, I think, has an incredibly timely concept in our era of social networks, because these networks -- these real-life networks that make up people's lives -- are actually embodied inside of the memorial. And one of the most tremendously moving experiences is to go to the memorial and see how these people are placed next to each other, so that this memorial is representing their own lives."", '12:23': ""How does this affect our lives? Well, I don't know if you remember, but in the spring, there was a controversy, because it was discovered that on the iPhone and, actually, on your computer, we were storing a tremendous amount of the location data. So Apple responded, saying, this was not location data about you, it was location data about wireless networks that were in the area where you are. So it's not about you, but it's about where you are."", '12:49': '(Laughter)', '12:51': 'This is very valuable data. It\'s like gold to researchers, this human-mobility data. So we thought, ""Man! How many people have iPhones?"" How many of you have iPhones? So in this room, we have this tremendous database of location data that researchers would really, really like.', '13:14': 'So we built this system called Open Paths, which lets people upload their iPhone data and broker relationships with researchers to share that data, to donate that data to people that can actually put it to use. Open Paths was a great success as a prototype. We received thousands of data sets, and we built this interface which allows people to actually see their lives unfolding from these traces that are left behind on your devices. Now, what we didn\'t expect was how moving this experience would be. When I uploaded my data, I thought, ""Big deal. I know where I live. I know where I work. What am I going to see here?"" Well, it turns out, what I saw was that moment I got off the plane to start my new life in New York; the restaurant where I had Thai food that first night, thinking about this new experience of being in New York; the day that I met my girlfriend. This is LaGuardia airport.', '14:09': '(Laughter)', '14:10': 'This is this Thai restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue. This is the moment I met my girlfriend.', '14:18': ""See how that changes the first time I told you about those stories and the second time I told you about those stories? Because what we do in the tool, inadvertently, is we put these pieces of data into a human context. And by placing data into a human context, it gains meaning. And I think this is tremendously, tremendously important, because these are our histories that are being stored on these devices. And by thinking about them that way, putting them in a human context -- first of all, what we do with our own data is get a better understanding of the type of information that we're sharing. But if we can do this with other data, if we can put data into a human context, I think we can change a lot of things, because it builds, automatically, empathy for the people involved in these systems. And that, in turn, results in a fundamental respect, which, I believe, is missing in a large part of technology, when we start to deal with issues like privacy, by understanding that these numbers are not just numbers, but instead they're attached, tethered to, pieces of the real world. They carry weight. By understanding that, the dialog becomes a lot different. How many of you have ever clicked a button that enables a third party to access your location data on your phone? Lots of you. So the third party is the developer, the second party is Apple. The only party that never gets access to this information is the first party! And I think that's because we think about these pieces of data in this stranded, abstract way. We don't put them into a context which, I think, makes them a lot more important."", '16:04': ""So what I'm asking you to do is really simple: start to think about data in a human context. It doesn't really take anything. When you read stock prices, think about them in a human context. When you think about mortgage reports, think about them in a human context. There's no doubt that big data is big business. There's an industry being developed here. Think about how well we've done in previous industries that we've developed involving resources. Not very well at all. I think part of that problem is, we've had a lack of participation in these dialogues from multiple pieces of human society."", '16:41': ""So the other thing that I'm asking for is an inclusion in this dialogue from artists, from poets, from writers -- from people who can bring a human element into this discussion. Because I believe that this world of data is going to be transformative for us. And unlike our attempts with the resource industry and our attempts with the financial industry, by bringing the human element into this story, I think we can take it to tremendous places."", '17:10': 'Thank you.', '17:11': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Level 1),"In medicine, there's often a disconnect between news headlines and the scientific research they cover. While headlines are designed to catch attention, many studies produce meaningful results when they focus on a narrow, specific question. So how can you figure out what's a genuine health concern and what's less conclusive? Jeff Leek and Lucy McGowan explain how to read past the headline.

""Aspirin may reduce risk of heart attacks."" ""Eating breakfast can help you lose weight.""', '00:20': 'Health headlines like these flood the news, often contradicting each other. So how can you figure out what’s a genuine health concern or a truly promising remedy, and what’s less conclusive?', '00:37': 'In medicine, there’s often a disconnect between news headlines and the scientific research they cover. That’s because a headline is designed to catch attention— it’s most effective when it makes a big claim. By contrast, many scientific studies produce meaningful results when they focus on a narrow, specific question.', '00:56': 'The best way to bridge this gap is to look at the original research behind a headline. We’ve come up with a simplified research scenario for each of these three headlines to test your skills. Keep watching for the explanation of the first study; then pause at the headline to figure out the flaw. Assume all the information you need to spot the flaw is included.', '01:20': 'Let’s start with this hypothetical scenario: a study using mice to test a new cancer drug. The study includes two groups of mice, one treated with the drug, the other with a placebo. At the end of the trial, the mice that receive the drug are cured, while those that received the placebo are not.', '01:38': 'Can you spot the problem with this headline: ""Study shows new drug could cure cancer""', '01:45': 'Since the subjects of the study were mice, we can’t draw conclusions about human disease based on this research. In real life, early research on new drugs and therapies is not conducted on humans. If the early results are promising, clinical trials follow to determine if they hold up in humans.', '02:04': 'Now that you’ve warmed up, let’s try a trickier example: a study about the impact of aspirin on heart attack risk. The study randomly divides a pool of men into two groups. The members of one group take aspirin daily, while the others take a daily placebo. By the end of the trial, the control group suffered significantly more heart attacks than the group that took aspirin.', '02:27': 'Based on this situation, what’s wrong with the headline: ""Aspirin may reduce risk of heart attacks""', '02:33': 'In this case, the study shows evidence that aspirin reduces heart attacks in men, because all the participants were men. But the conclusion “aspirin reduces risk of heart attacks” is too broad; we can’t assume that results found in men would also apply to women. Studies often limit participants based on geographic location, age, gender, or many other factors. Before these findings can be generalized, similar studies need to be run on other groups. If a headline makes a general claim, it should draw its evidence from a diverse body of research, not one study.', '03:08': 'Can you take your skills from the first two questions to the next level? Try this example about the impact of eating breakfast on weight loss. Researchers recruit a group of people who had always skipped breakfast and ask them to start eating breakfast everyday. The participants include men and women of a range of ages and backgrounds. Over a year-long period, participants lose an average of five pounds.', '03:33': 'So what’s wrong with the headline: ""Eating breakfast can help you lose weight""', '03:38': 'The people in the study started eating breakfast and lost weight— but we don’t know that they lost weight because they started eating breakfast; perhaps having their weight tracked inspired them to change their eating habits in other ways. To rule out the possibility that some other factor caused weight loss, we would need to compare these participants to a group who didn’t eat breakfast before the study and continued to skip it during the study. A headline certainly shouldn’t claim the results of this research are generally applicable. And if the study itself made such a claim without a comparison group, then you should question its credibility.', '04:13': 'Now that you’ve battle-tested your skills on these hypothetical studies and headlines, you can test them on real-world news. Even when full papers aren’t available without a fee, you can often find summaries of experimental design and results in freely available abstracts, or even within the text of a news article. Individual studies have results that don’t necessarily correspond to a grabby headline. Big conclusions for human health issues require lots of evidence accumulated over time. But in the meantime, we can keep on top of the science, by reading past the headlines.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TED Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz shows how light pollution is ruining the extraordinary -- and often ignored -- experience of seeing directly into space.,0:11:01,11.01666667,300596,2012-02-19T14:53:14+00:00,"['TED Fellows', 'TEDx', 'environment', 'global issues', 'science', 'space', 'NASA', 'pollution', 'Planets', 'activism', 'technology', 'universe']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Türkçe', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'Українська', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Lucianne Walkowicz,Stellar astronomer,"{'00:09': ""The sky is inherently democratic. It's accessible, in principle, anyway, by anyone, everywhere, just simply by the act of looking up. But like so many beautiful things around us, it's slipping away from us, and we haven't even noticed, because we're honestly not really looking. So what do we look at instead? Well, we look at our phones, we look at our computers, we look at screens of all kinds. And honestly, we rarely even take the trouble to look up enough to see each other, let alone taking that next step to looking up at the actual sky. Now, there's a tendency to think that the loss of our dark night skies is the inevitable outcome of progress, change, technology. And you know, that's just simply not true. Later on, I'll tell you why."", '01:00': ""But first, I want to tell you about my experience of the dark night sky. I never saw a truly dark night sky until I was 15. I was here, in Arizona. I was on a road trip; I pulled over somewhere. I have no idea where I was, except I know what state. And I looked up, and the sky was just filled with an impossible number of stars. You see, I'm from New York City, and in New York, you can see the moon, you can see a couple of stars. More often than not, they turn out to be airplanes when they land."", '01:34': '(Laughter)', '01:35': ""But there's really not much else."", '01:37': 'As a result, most of my colleagues who are astronomers spent at least part of their youth looking up at the sky in their backyard. I never really had that experience, and, as a result, I\'m really disappointing on camping trips. I don\'t really know many constellations. The ones I do know, you probably know them, too. But I\'ll never forget that experience of the first time I saw the dark night sky. And I was just flabbergasted at how many stars there were. And I felt tiny. Then I also felt like, ""Where\'s this been hiding this whole time? Who\'s been hiding this sky from me?""', '02:17': ""Of course, the answer is obvious if you think about it or if you look at the picture on the left, where you're seeing the same neighborhood taken during a blackout versus on an ordinary night. You can't see the stars if you drown them out with light. Take a look at our planet. This is our planet from space. Unlike stars, which are hot and glow invisible light so we can see them, our planet is, astronomically speaking, pretty cold. So it doesn't really glow. When you see the planet looking like a blue-green marble the way it does in this picture, you're seeing it because the sunlight is reflecting off of it, and that's why you can see the oceans, the clouds, the land. So if the sun wasn't shining on it, we wouldn't be able to see the earth, right? Or would we?"", '03:08': ""This is our earth at night, and it is one of the most striking examples of how we have affected our planet on a global scale. You can see light spidering out across the globe everywhere. Now, of course, there are broad expanses of ocean that are still dark, and in many underdeveloped areas there's still darkness. But you'll notice that this is a pretty global effect. We tend to think, when we think of places being lit up, of very extreme examples -- Times Square, the Vegas Strip. But really what that picture shows you is that it's not just these extreme examples, it's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting. This tends to be a really dramatic effect on the ground."", '03:52': 'To understand why, all you really have to do is think about the shape of a lightbulb. The lightbulb, for all practical purposes, is more or less round. This is great for its original intended purpose of lighting up the indoors. You turn it on, light goes everywhere. An individual light bulb can light up your whole room, more or less. Now, that\'s great if you\'re lighting the indoors, but in its application in outdoor lighting, that traditional shape of the light bulb, the sort of globe that spreads light everywhere, is actually very inefficient. When you\'re outdoors, mostly what you care about is lighting the ground beneath you and your immediate surroundings. All of that light that gets scattered outwards and upwards doesn\'t actually help you light the area around you. What it does is scatters up into the sky and becomes what we call ""light pollution."" Even if you don\'t care anything about stargazing, this should worry you, because it means that 60-70% of the energy we use to light the outdoors is wasted by blotting out the stars.', '04:55': ""Now, like I said, I'm a big fan of technology. Obviously, I use technology every day; I'm a scientist. And there's this tendency to say that it's progress that -- you know, I'm not suggesting we're going to all go live by candlelight. Indeed, technology is allowing us to access the sky in ways that are impossible otherwise. One of the greatest examples of this is, of course, the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble went up into space, it returns pictures daily, and it allows us to see things that we are incapable of seeing with our naked eye, in ways that we've never been able to do before in all of human history. Other examples of this would be planetarium shows. In the past couple of years, planetarium shows have become more high-tech with these great visualizations, and even though this isn't access directly to the sky, it's at least access to our knowledge about the sky. And indeed, we can experience the sky in a planetarium in a way that is impossible for us to do just sitting out and looking in the dark."", '05:57': 'All of you have heard of the Hubble Space Telescope and of planetariums. But there are also ways for technology to enable participation in people\'s experience of the sky that you may not be familiar with. These are called ""citizen science projects."" Citizen science is when large research projects put their data online, teach ordinary people, like you, to go and interact with that data and actually contribute to the research by making interesting or necessary characterizations about it.', '06:27': 'One such example of this is what I\'m showing here, called ""Galaxy Zoo."" Galaxy Zoo is a project where people get a 20-minute -- even less than that, actually -- tutorial on how to interact with these images of galaxies. They learn to annotate the images, and within a couple of minutes, they\'re up and running, and they\'re making really useful categorizations and classifications of these galaxies. Now, it\'s easy to understand why Galaxy Zoo would be an easy sell for people to be involved with: it involves pretty pictures; galaxies are, generally speaking, pretty attractive. However, there are many other flavors of citizen science projects that people have delved into that have varying levels of abstraction, that you wouldn\'t necessarily think people would jump at.', '07:12': 'One such example of this is the citizen science project associated with the mission that I\'m part of, called the Kepler Mission. Kepler is a space telescope and it looks for planets around other stars by measuring the light from those stars very precisely. And we\'re looking for the dimmings caused by stars blocking off some of that light. We have an associated citizen science project called ""Planet Hunters."" Planet Hunters gives you, like Galaxy Zoo, a short tutorial, and within a couple of minutes, you\'re up and running; you\'re looking at data from the Kepler Mission and looking for planets. The idea behind this is an easy sell, right? But the actual process of planet-hunting involves a lot of looking at graphs, like the one I\'m showing you here, and annotating them. I do this all day and that doesn\'t even sound that interesting to me. However, not only are people interested in doing this, but the citizen scientists that work with Planet Hunters have actually found planets in the data that would have gone undiscovered otherwise.', '08:18': ""This is an author list from the paper that they published of the planet they discovered. You'll see that all the people who contributed are listed below, and it's sort of an odd amalgam of people's real names and their log-in names. You'll notice if you look carefully, this is the first academic acknowledgment of the importance of Irish coffee in the discovery process."", '08:38': '(Laughter)', '08:40': ""I don't want to give you the idea that these are some out-of-work scientists or just a bunch of nerds that are really into this. There are 60,000 people who participate in these projects, and most of them don't have technical backgrounds. So clearly, what this is feeding into is people's curiosity and their willingness to be part of the scientific discovery process. People want to do this."", '09:03': ""But all of this technology and all these digitally mediated ways of experiencing the sky still have something of a feel to me like looking at an animal in a zoo. It's a valid way of experiencing that thing -- indeed, the lion in the cage is still real, the Hubble images are indeed real, and you can get closer to a lion in a zoo than you can in the wild. However, it's missing something. It's missing that savage beauty of experiencing that very thing in the wild for yourself, unmediated by a screen."", '09:38': ""The experience of looking up and knowing that the sky you're looking at surrounds every known living thing in the universe is very profound. Think about that for a moment. We are the only planet we know of that has life on it. The sky that you see is shared by every other living thing that we know of in existence. One of the things that I really like about my work is that it allows me to step back from my every day and to experience the larger context, this feeling that just as we go out and try to find planets in the universe that might be like ours, it always reminds me of how precious what we have here is. Our night sky is like a natural resource, it's as though it's a park that you can visit without ever having to travel there. But like any natural resource, if we don't protect it, if we don't preserve it and treasure it, it will slip away from us and be gone."", '10:41': ""So if you're interested in this, and this is something you want to learn more about, I encourage you in particular to visit darksky.org and to learn more about the choices you can make that can protect the dark night sky, because it belongs to everyone, it belongs to all of us, and therefore, it's ours to experience as we wish. And it's also ours to lose."", '11:02': 'Thank you.', '11:04': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_wright_the_evolution_of_compassion,The evolution of compassion,"Robert Wright uses evolutionary biology and game theory to explain why we appreciate the Golden Rule (""Do unto others...""), why we sometimes ignore it and why there’s hope that, in the near future, we might all have the compassion to follow it.",0:16:41,16.68333333,300445,2008-10-31T19:39:00+00:00,"['charter for compassion', 'compassion', 'evolution', 'global issues']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Čeština', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Robert Wright,"Journalist, philosopher","{'00:05': ""I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective. I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule. So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language, and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that."", '00:32': ""So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great. The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths."", '00:52': ""At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit. I think nature gave them a helping hand here. I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are, in a certain sense, built into human nature. But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature, you realize that just affirming compassion, and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough. There's a lot of work to be done after that."", '01:23': ""OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion. In the beginning, there was compassion, and I mean not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage, even before there were homo sapiens, feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool, and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened."", '01:52': ""It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that, if an animal feels compassion for a close relative, and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative, then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK."", '02:25': ""I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy. I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier. This doesn't bother me so much, that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level. Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural. The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family."", '02:58': 'Now, there\'s more good news that came along later in evolution, a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that ""reciprocal altruism."" OK. And there, the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist\'s point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too. It\'s not that people think that, when they feel the compassion. It\'s not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that\'s the logic. And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.', '03:47': ""I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them, you feel really bad. But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of, you can probably live with that. That's just human nature. So, it's another good news/bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself. So, there's still work to be done."", '04:16': ""Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism, which I think is kind of good news, which is that the way that this is played out in the human species, it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule. I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes, but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions, no exposure to ethical philosophy, and you'll find, if you spend time with these people, that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another, and that bad deeds should be punished. And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes. So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well, you treat other people well. And it's good to treat other people well. That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition."", '05:09': ""So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention, you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here; we still aren't to universal love, and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural, it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule."", '05:27': 'I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison, but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right? So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated. Now, we have a rationale for that. We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.', '05:45': ""None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions, put people in a special category. And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison, you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule -- that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to, is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival -- if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family -- I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you."", '06:26': 'We all do that, and you see it all over the world. You see it in the Middle East: people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel. They wouldn\'t want to have missiles fired at them, but they say, ""Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things that put them in a special category."" The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them, but they impose one on Gaza, and they say, ""Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves.""', '06:51': ""So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble. And it's natural to do that. So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love. It's not going to save the world."", '07:13': ""Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. Are you on the edges of your seats here? Good, because before I tell you about that good news, I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain. So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world."", '07:34': ""It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. It's just a quick introduction to game theory. This won't hurt. Okay. It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies, the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation. And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies, it's a zero-sum situation."", '08:00': ""So, what do those terms mean? Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports, where there's a winner and a loser. So, their fortunes add up to zero. So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person, or good for them, bad for you. Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game."", '08:20': ""Now, if you're playing doubles, then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you, because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win -- or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose. That's a non-zero-sum game. And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games. In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something: that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money, but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. You both feel you've won. In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game. It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them."", '08:54': 'So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life. And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels. So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.', '09:35': ""Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. And now I can admit that it might not too, now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness, these webs that can be these channels for compassion. You can go back all the way to the stone age: technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing, a lot of transportation and communication technologies -- has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non-zero-sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. That's the story of civilization. It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world. And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness."", '10:39': 'You\'ve probably heard the term ""interdependence"" applied to the modern world. Well, that\'s just another term for non-zero-sum. If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody, then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them. And you see this all the time in the modern world. You saw it with the recent economic crash, where bad things happen in the economy -- bad for everybody, for much of the world. Good things happen, and it\'s good for much of the world.', '11:04': ""And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence that this non-zero-sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. I mean, if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II -- look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman, and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs, really without giving it much of a thought -- and you compare that to the attitude now, I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence."", '11:34': ""Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people. So, I think that's good. And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics. Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat. And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of."", '11:54': ""For example, probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans."", '12:21': ""So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness. And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness, why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding? The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk. Certainly, a couple of things are that, first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world. And also, sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world. In both of these areas, I think politicians can play a role."", '12:58': ""This isn't only about religion. I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships, Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on, in this regard. And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that, when people around the world are looking at them, are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation -- like, say, America, or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cues like: Do we feel we're being respected? Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected, you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum, mutually profitable relationship with people. So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out. And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work."", '13:50': 'If there\'s one thing I can encourage everyone to do, politicians, religious leaders, and us, it would be what I call ""expanding the moral imagination"" -- that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. This is not the same as compassion, but it\'s conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion. And I\'m afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. That\'s good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.', '14:25': 'Once we define somebody as an enemy, we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally. So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American: somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV. Well, the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person\'s head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. And if you tell them, ""Well, they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America. Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly""? You know, they\'ll resist that comparison and that\'s natural, that\'s human.', '15:04': ""And, similarly, the person in Iran: when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil, they'll have trouble with that. So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go. I think it's worth the trouble because, again, it just helps us to understand. If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags, it helps to understand what makes them do it. And I think it's good moral exercise."", '15:32': ""I would say here is where religious leaders come in, because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people, at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. It's their great calling right now, to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations, appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat."", '16:03': ""I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective, as far as compassion and the golden rule go, by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed. And it's going to take real work to change that. But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.

So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides  from way back when, and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here."", '00:17': 'So, basically it all began with  this whole idea of a computer. Who has a computer? Yeah.  O.K., so, everyone has a computer. Even a mobile phone, it\'s a computer.  And -- anyone remember this workbook,  ""Instant Activities for Your Apple"" --  free poster in each book? This was how computing began.  Don\'t forget: a computer came out; it had no software.  You\'d buy that thing, you\'d bring it home, you\'d plug it in,  and it would do absolutely nothing at all.  So, you had to program it,  and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.  I mean, this was great.  It\'s, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II. It\'s such a great way to --  I mean, they should make Java books like this,  and we\'ve have no problem learning a program.  But this was a great, grand time of the computer,  when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.  And, you see,  this era coincided with my own childhood.', '01:12': ""I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.  Who of you grew up in a family business,  suffered the torture? Yes, yes. The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?  It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;  it was a family business.  And my mother was a kind of a designer, also.  She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,  and it would confuse the customers,  because they all thought it was a restaurant. A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.  But, anyway, that's where I grew up,  in this little tofu factory in Seattle,  and it was kind of like this:  a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture."", '01:50': ""That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:  he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.  Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,  and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,  because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,  and so you have to have heavy stuff  to push out the liquid and make it hard.  Tofu comes out in these big batches,  and my father would sort of cut them by hand.  I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this --  my father was the most sincere man possible.  He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,  slipped, broke his arm, rushed out: he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.  So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken  for two weeks in the store, and that week --  now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I  had to do everything. And that was torture, real torture.  Because, you see, we'd seen my father  taking the big block of tofu and cutting it, like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.  So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.  Bad blocks. But anyways,  the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically. And because working in a store was so hard,  I liked going to school; it was like heaven.  And I was really good at school."", '03:06': ""So, when I got to MIT, you know,  as most of you who are creatives, your parents all told you not to be creative, right?  So, same way, you know,  I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's -- John's good at math.  I went to MIT, did my math,  but I had this wonderful opportunity, because computers had just become visual.  The Apple -- Macintosh just came out;  I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.  And it was a time when a guy who, kind of,  could cross the two sides -- it was a good time."", '03:36': 'And so, I remember that my first major piece of software  was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.  I made a desktop publishing system way back when,  and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to --  oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.  And the problem when you\'re younger --  for all you students out there -- is, your head gets kind of big really easy.  And when I was making icons, I was, like,  the icon master, and I was, like, yeah, I\'m really good at this, you know.  And then luckily, you know,  I had the fortune of going to something called a library,  and in the library I came upon this very book.  I found this book. It\'s called,  ""Thoughts on Design,"" by a man named Paul Rand. It\'s a little slim volume; I\'m not sure if you\'ve seen this.  It\'s a very nice little book. It\'s about this guy, Paul Rand,  who was one of the greatest graphic designers,  and also a great writer as well.  And when I saw this man\'s work,  I realized how bad I was at design, or whatever I called it back then,  and I suddenly had a kind of career goal,  kind of in hot pursuit.', '04:38': 'So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.  I got my masters, and then went to art school after that.  And just began to design stuff, like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:  sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.  And isn\'t it that strange moment when you publish your design?  Remember that moment -- publishing your designs?  Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn\'t it?  So, I was published, you know,  so, wow, my design\'s in a book, you know?  After that, things kind of got strange,  and I got thinking about the computer,  because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.  I didn\'t quite get it. And Paul Rand  was a kind of crusty designer,  you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread?  You know, he wrote in one of his books:  ""A Yale student once said, \'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.\'  Design schools take heed.""  This is in the \'80s,  in the great clash of computer/non-computer people. A very difficult time, actually.  And this to me was an important message from Rand.', '05:39': ""And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.  This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.  I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.  It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.  It was very hard to make this, actually.  It took a month to make this part.  And then I thought, what if I added this feature,  where I can say, this point,  you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.  So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability  with a little control there on the dial,  and I can sort of watch it flip around.  And this is in 1993.  And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.  They were saying, Why's it moving?  They were saying, Make it stop now. Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.  And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?  And I said, Never.  And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.  I started studying this whole idea,  of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium. It's not like print. It's not like video.  It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.  So, I went off with this,  and began to look for things even more."", '06:46': 'And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.  This is actually bad: human experiments.  I would do these things where I\'d have students become pens:  there\'s blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.  And someone sits down and draws a picture.  They\'re laughing because he said,  draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.  See, humans don\'t know how to take orders;  the computer\'s so good at it.  This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:  you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this. And so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again, hard to do with our hands.  And then someone discovered this ""a-ha moment""  where you could use coordinate systems.  We thought, ah, this is when it\'s going to happen.  In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.  It became computerish; we began to think computerish --  the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation.', '07:43': ""And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,  called a human-powered computer.  So, this happened in 1993. Sound down, please.  It's a computer where the people are the parts.  I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,  a graphics card, a memory system.  They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.  It's put inside the computer.  And that little program's on that cardboard disk.  So, she wears the disk,  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk, and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.  And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer, I had a moment of -- what is it called? --  the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.  This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,  and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.  And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,  if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.  On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.  On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour  for the mouse cursor to change.  To give you a sense of the speed, the scale:  the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?"", '08:58': 'And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.  This is something I did for Sony in 1996.  It was three Sony ""H"" devices  that responded to sound. So, if you talk into the mike, you\'ll hear some music in your headphones;  if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.  So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways  with this kind of mixture of skills.  I did this ad. I don\'t believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.  And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.', '09:25': ""And also, one thing I realized is that  I like to make things. We like to make things. It's fun to make things.  And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.  I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand --  these sort of broken hands. And these hands were influenced  by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi. This guy was my kind of like mentor.  He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.  He's the guy that kind of discovered me,  and kind of got me going in digital media.  He was such an inspirational guy.  I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,  and then he'd show up from some client meeting.  He'd come in and say, you know,  If I am here, everything is okay. And you'd feel so much better, you know.  And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,  he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm.  He went into a coma. And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,  and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --  how fragile is this thing we're wearing,  this body and mind we're wearing,  and so I thought, How do you go for it more?  How do you take that time you have left and go after it?  So, Naomi was pivotal in that."", '10:34': 'And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.  This was a moment where I was thinking about,  so, you have a computer program,  it responds to motion -- X and Y --  and I realized that each computer program  has all these images inside the program. So, if you can see here, you know,  that program you\'re seeing in the corner, if you spread it out, it\'s all these things all at once.  It\'s real simultaneity. It\'s nothing we\'re used to working with.  We\'re so used to working in one vector.  This is all at the same time. The computer lives in so many dimensions.  And also, at the same time I was frustrated,  because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,  and there were these, like, ""the computer lab,"" you know,  and this is, like, in the late 1990s,  and this is in Basel,  a great graphic design school. And here\'s this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,  kind of, dark computer room.  And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?  Is this what we want, you know?', '11:31': 'And also, I began to be fascinated by machines --  you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel. I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive --  this is, like, a touch screen --  and I noticed how you can only touch five places,  and so, ""why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?""  became a question. And also, the sound:  I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it\'s a telephone.  You get it? No? O.K. And also, I discovered in Logan airport,  this was, like, calling out to me.  Do you hear that? It\'s like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.', '12:11': ""So, I was wondering, like,  what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?  It didn't make any sense.  So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects  made of old computers from my basement.  I made -- I took my old Macintoshes  and made different objects out of them from Tokyo.  I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,  so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.  I made this series of works.  They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle  as a kind of display that's sort of thinking,  I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.  And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction."", '12:46': ""I began to be fascinated by plastic,  so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks  perfectly optically transparent,  as a kind of release of stress. Because of that, I became interested in blue tape,  so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape. I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.  And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,  so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,  Well, what else is there in life?  And so computers, as you know,  these big computers, there are now tiny computers.  They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,  I began to program one-chip computers  and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs. I began to make LED sculptures  that would live inside little boxes out of MDF.  This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.  Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.  This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:  it's sort of a plastic rice lamp; it's very friendly.  I did a show in London last year made out of iPods --  I used iPods as a material.  So I took 16 iPod Nanos  and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically. Recently, this is for Reebok.  I've done shoes for Reebok as well, as a kind of a hobby for apparel."", '14:00': ""So anyways, there are all these things you can do,  but the thing I love the most is to  experience, taste the world. The world is just so tasty.  We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.  No, they're all out there.  So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,  actually, around the Louvre area.  This I found, where nature had made a picture for me.  This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.  In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.  We all are creative people.  We have this gene defect in our mind. We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.  It's the forever-always-on museum.  This is from the Cape last year.  I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,  which we know as circle-triangle-square.  It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.  I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.  I put these all back, by the way.  And I also discovered how .  some rocks are twins separated at birth. This is also out there, you know.  I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?  I brought you guys together again."", '15:02': ""So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T  occurring in simplicity and complexity.  My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment --  a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment --  where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this. And I went after it with passion.  However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --  going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,  because the letters had told me, MIT forever.  But I discovered in the French word raison d'être.  I was, like, aha, wait a second.  And there RISD appeared.  And so I realized it was O.K. to go."", '15:37': ""So, I'm going to RISD, actually.  Who's a RISD alum out there?  RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too. RISD is kind of my new kind of passion,  and I'll tell you a little bit about that.  So, RISD is --  I was outside RISD, and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,  Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is.  And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,  or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that  although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.  It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.  People say,  Are you going to bring RISD into the future? And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD."", '16:21': ""There's my perspective. Because in reality,  the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.  It's about how to make it more humane again.  And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.  It's a strange exuberance  about materials, about the world: a fascination that I think the world needs  quite very much right now.  So, thank you everyone.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended consequences of Prohibition.', '00:36': 'The nationwide ban on the production and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure during World War I. But the view in the Western world of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills was much older. It first gained traction during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink.', '01:03': 'By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups called temperance movements began to appear in the United States and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty and domestic violence, and set out to convince governments of this. While some simply advocated moderate drinking, many believed alcohol should be banned entirely. These movements drew support from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, especially Protestants, denounced alcohol as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize.', '01:52': 'Governments weren’t strangers to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting these communities— though there were many other destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations and on reservation land.', '02:16': 'American temperance movements gained their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of all alcoholic beverages.', '02:38': 'The amendment took effect a year later under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular political faction.', '03:22': 'Tens of thousands of illegal bars, known as ""speakeasies,"" began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol from being consumed, the government required manufacturers to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths.', '03:52': 'We don’t know exactly how much people were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking.', '04:20': 'With the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed.', '04:40': 'Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely didn’t work, the health and social impacts of alcohol remain concerns today.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But recent studies show that 33% of wild fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their maximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, or aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems we’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes we’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we currently using, and what does a sustainable way to farm the ocean really look like?', '00:58': 'One of the most common aquaculture methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating cages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases to wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back into the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool with genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species.', '01:49': 'Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone to spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons of greenhouse gases.', '02:14': 'One way to solve these problems is to farm fish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and filter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms are connected to overfishing.', '02:45': 'All these obstacles can make sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new ways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all may be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish and seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna don’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight and nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other species to thrive.', '03:31': 'Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for coastal communities, and support healthy plant and shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly low carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively the size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every stroke felt like pulling through oil. And in the first five minutes, I had that paralyzing thought of just giving up. How nice it would be to just forget about all this, get on the boat, stand underneath the hot shower or wrap myself in a warm blanket? But with that thought, also came a stronger, a more willful voice from deep within. ""You know you have it in you to just take one more stroke."" So I lifted my arm and took a stroke. ""Now one more."" So I took a second and a third stroke. By the fourth one, I saw a penguin swimming underneath my stomach. It came up to my left and started swimming with me. ""See? A penguin is cheering you on,"" said that voice within.', '05:21': '(Applause and cheers)', '05:25': 'I looked up to my people on the boat. They had the same smile on their faces that I had on mine.

We all have our own internal demons, don\'t we? In a day-to-day life, you can hide from them, behind your work or many other distractions.

But on many other days, it means getting over my depressing thoughts, stepping out of the house and being able to do the daily chores. What does not change is that voice within. That internal compass which guides me to a better self every day.

Barriers of energy separate them from their quest’s second goal: the Node of Creation. To reach it, Ethic must use three energy streams to climb the tower. As soon as she steps forward a timer will begin counting down from 60 seconds. At the back of the room there’s a basin made of invisible towers that can hold energy between them. After one minute, a torrent of energy will pour down from above, filling one unit at a time, with a force field preventing it from spilling out the front or back. During the 60 calm seconds, Ethic and Hedge must decide exactly how many units of energy will fall. For each of the three challenges, they must choose the amount that will fill the basin exactly. If they do so, the energy will propel them further upwards. But if they get the amount at all wrong, the energy lift will fail, dropping them. Diagrams on the walls illustrate some examples. This configuration will capture exactly 2 units of energy. This configuration will capture 4— 3 here, and 1 here. And this one will also capture 4, because any energy on the right would spill out. The energy will rain down in such a way that it’ll only overflow if there’s no space that could hold it. Hedge can make one tower of blocks visible at a time and count how tall it is, but he can’t look at the whole structure all at once. How does Ethic program Hedge to figure out exactly how much energy each basin can hold? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s one way of thinking about what’s happening: each unoccupied cell will hold energy if and only if there is a wall eventually to its left, and a wall eventually to its right. But it would take a long time for Hedge to check this for each individual cell. So what if he were to consider a whole column of blocks at a time? How many units of energy can this hold, for instance? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Let’s analyze the problem by looking at our example. There are 5 columns of blocks here. The leftmost one can’t hold any energy, because there’s nothing higher than it. The 2nd stack can have 3 units above it, as they would be trapped between these two 4 block stacks. We get 3 units by taking the height where the energy would level off— 4, and subtracting the height of the stack— so that’s 4 minus 1. The 3rd stack is similar— 4 to the left, 4 to the right, and it’s 3 high, so it’ll hold 4 minus 3 equals 1 unit. The 4th stack and 5th stacks have nothing higher than them to the right, so they can’t hold any energy. We can adapt this idea into an algorithm. Considering one column at a time as the point of reference, Hedge can look to the left stack by stack to find the height of the tallest one, look to the right to find the height of the tallest one, and take the smaller of the two as the height the energy can fill up to. If the result is higher than the column in question, subtract the height of the original column, and the result will be the number of units that column can hold. If it's equal to or below the level of the column in question, the energy would spill off. Hedge can apply that to an entire basin with a loop that starts on the left-most column and moves right, one column at a time. For each column, he’ll run the same steps— look all the way left for the tallest, do the same to the right, take the lower height of the two, subtract the original column height, and increase the grand total if that number is positive. His loop will repeat as many times as there are columns. That will work, but it’ll take a long time for a large basin. At every step Hedge repeats the action of looking left and looking right. If there are N stacks, he’ll look at all N stacks N times. Is there a faster way? Here’s one time saver: before doing anything else, Hedge can start on the left, and keep a running tally of what the highest stack is. Here that would be 2, 2 again, since the first was higher, then 4, 4, 4. He can then find the highest right-most stacks by doing the same going right-to-left: 1, 3, 4, 4, 4. In the end he’ll have a table like this in his memory. Now, Hedge can take one more pass to calculate how much energy there will be above every stack with the same equation from before: take the smaller of the stored left and right values, and subtract the height of the current tower. Instead of looking at N stacks N times, he’ll look at N stacks just 3 times— which is what’s called linear time. There are ways to optimize the solution even further, but this is good enough for our heroes. Ethic and Hedge work as one. The first cascade is a breeze, and they rise up the tower. The second is a little tougher. The third is huge, with dozens of stacks of blocks. The timer ticks down towards zero, but Ethic’s program is fast. She gets the wheel in position just in time, and the energy lifts them to the Node of Creation. Like the first, it reveals a vision: memories of years gone by. The world machine changed everything, and Ethic, in her position as chief robotics engineer, grew troubled by what she saw. When the Bradbarrier went up to keep the people in, she knew something was seriously wrong. So she created three artifacts with the ability to restore people’s power, creativity, and memory, and smuggled them to three communities. Before she could tell people how to use them, the government discovered her efforts and sent bots to arrest her and the other programmers. The last thing Ethic used the world machine to create was a robot that would protect the ancient device from the forces of ignorance by enclosing it in a giant maze. She named her creation Hedge. Without warning, the energy lift flickers, then fizzles out.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a fascinating talk and live demo, biologist James Logan introduces Freya, a malaria-sniffing dog, to show how we can harness the awesome powers of animal scent to detect chemical signatures associated with infection -- and change the way we diagnose disease.",0:17:32,17.53333333,291453,2019-10-21T15:10:48+00:00,"['TEDx', 'science', 'smell', 'animals', 'biology', 'illness', 'disease']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Русский', 'العربية', 'मराठी', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",James Logan,"Biologist, medical entomologist","{'00:10': ""Malaria is still one of the biggest killers on the planet. Despite us making significant progress in the last 20 years, half the world's population is still at risk from this disease. In fact, every two minutes, a child under the age of two dies from malaria. Our progress has undoubtedly stalled."", '00:35': ""Now we face many challenges when it comes to tackling malaria, but one of the problems that we have is actually finding people who are infected with malaria in the first place. So, for example, if people have some level of immunity to the disease, then they can develop an infection and become infectious and still pass it on but not actually develop any symptoms, and that can be a big problem, because how do you find those people? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Now scientists have been trying to solve this problem for some years, but what I want to talk to you about today is that the solution to this problem may have been right under our noses this whole time."", '01:18': ""Now that was a bit of a heavy start, with lots of really important statistics, so I want us all to just relax a little bit and that'll help me to relax a little bit as well. So why don't we just all take a nice deep breath in ... Wow. (Laughs)"", '01:31': ""And sigh, and, whoo, going to get blown away there. OK, now I want you to do it again, but this time, I want you to do it just through your nose, and I want you to really sense the environment around you. And in fact, I want you to really smell the person who's sitting next to you. Even if you don't know them, I don't care. Lean in, get your nose right into their armpit, come on, stop being so British about it, get your nose into the armpit, have a good old sniff, see what you can smell."", '01:59': '(Laughter)', '02:02': ""Now each and every one of us would have had a very different sensory experience there. Some of us would have smelled something rather pleasant, perhaps somebody's perfume. But some of us might have smelled something a little bit less pleasant, perhaps somebody's bad breath or body odor. Maybe you even smelled your own body odor."", '02:22': '(Laughter)', '02:24': 'But, you know, there\'s probably a good reason that some of us don\'t like certain body smells. Throughout history, there have been many examples of diseases being associated with a smell. So, for example, typhoid apparently smells like baked brown bread, and that\'s quite a nice smell, isn\'t it, but it starts to get a little bit worse. TB smells like stale beer, and yellow fever smells like the inside of a butcher shop, like raw meat. And in fact, when you look at the sort of words that are used to describe diseases, you tend to find these words: ""rotting,"" ""foul,"" ""putrid"" or ""pungent."" So it\'s no surprise, then, that smell and body odor gets a bit of bad reputation. If I was to say to you, ""You smell,"" now, you\'re going to take that not exactly as a compliment, are you. But you do smell. You\'ve just found that out. You do smell. It\'s a scientific fact.', '03:22': ""And I'd quite like to turn that on its head. What if we could actually think about smell in a positive way, put it to good use? What if we could detect the chemicals that are given off by our bodies when we're ill, and use that to diagnose people? Now we'd need to develop good sensors that would allow us to do this, but it turns out that the world's best sensors actually already exist, and they're called animals."", '03:48': ""Now animals are built to smell. They live their everyday lives according to their nose. They sense the environment, which tells them really important information about how to stay alive, essentially. Just imagine you're a mosquito and you've just flown in from outside and you've entered this room. Now you're going to be entering a really complex world. You're going to be bombarded with smells from everywhere. We've just found out that we're really smelly beasts. Each one of us is producing different volatile chemicals. It's not just one chemical, like BO -- lots and lots of chemicals. But it's not just you, it's the seats you're sitting on, the carpet, the glue that holds the carpet to the floor, the paint on the walls, the trees outside. Everything around you is producing an odor, and it's a really complex world that the mosquito has to fly through, and it has to find you within that really complex world. And each and every one of you will know -- Come on, hands up, who always gets bitten by mosquitoes? And who never gets bitten? There's always one or two really annoying people that never get bitten. But the mosquito has a really hard job to find you, and that's all to do with the way you smell. People who don't attract mosquitoes smell repellent, and what we know is that --"", '04:57': '(Laughter)', '04:58': 'I should clarify, repellent to mosquitoes, not to people.', '05:02': '(Laughter)', '05:03': ""And what we know now is that that is actually controlled by our genes. But mosquitoes are able to do that because they have a highly sophisticated sense of smell, and they're able to see through all the, sort of, odor sludge to find you, that individual, and bite you as a blood meal."", '05:21': ""But what would happen if one of you was infected with malaria? Well, let's just have a quick look at the malaria life cycle. So it's quite complex, but basically, what happens is a mosquito has to bite somebody to become infected. Once it bites an infected person, the parasite travels through the mouth part into the gut and then bursts through the gut, creates cysts, and then the parasites replicate, and then they make a journey from the gut all the way to the salivary glands, where they are then injected back into another person when the mosquito bites, because it injects saliva as it bites. Then, inside the human, it goes through a whole other cycle, a whole other part of the life cycle, so it goes through a liver stage, changes shape, and then comes out into the bloodstream again, and eventually, that person will become infectious. Now, one thing we know about the parasite world is that they are incredibly good at manipulating their hosts to enhance their own transmission, to make sure that they get passed onwards. If this was to happen in the malaria system, it might make sense that it would be something to do with odor that they manipulate, because odor is the key. Odor is the thing that links us between mosquitoes. That's how they find us. This is what we call the malaria manipulation hypothesis, and it's something that we've been working on over the last few years. So one of the first things that we wanted to do in our study was to find out whether an infection with malaria actually makes you more attractive to mosquitoes or not."", '06:46': 'So in Kenya, with our colleagues, we designed an experiment where we had participants, children in Kenya, sleep inside tents. The odor from the tent was blown into a chamber which contained mosquitoes, and the mosquitoes would behaviorally respond. They would fly towards or fly away from the odors, depending on whether they liked them or not. Now some of the participants were infected with malaria, and some of them were uninfected, but importantly, none of the children had any symptoms whatsoever.', '07:16': 'Now when we found and saw the results, it was really quite staggering. People who were infected with malaria were significantly more attractive than people who were uninfected. So let me explain this graph. We have ""number of mosquitoes attracted to the child,"" and we have two sets of data: before treatment and after treatment. On the far left-hand side, that bar represents a group of people who are uninfected, and as we move towards the right-hand side, these people have become infected and they\'re moving towards the stage that they\'re infectious. So right at the stage when people are infectious is when they are significantly more attractive.', '07:50': ""In this study, then, what we did is we obviously gave the children treatment to clear the parasites, and then we tested them again, and what we found was that highly attractive trait that was there disappeared after they had cleared the infection. So it wasn't just that the people were more attractive, it was that the parasite was manipulating its host in some way to make it more attractive to mosquitoes, standing out like a beacon to attract more mosquitoes so that it could continue its life cycle."", '08:17': 'The next thing we wanted to do was find out what it was the mosquito was actually smelling. What was it detecting? So to do that, we had to collect the body odor from the participants, and we did this by wrapping bags around their feet, which allowed us to collect the volatile odors from their feet, and feet are really important to mosquitoes. They really love the smell of feet.', '08:36': '(Laughter)', '08:37': ""Especially cheesy feet. Anybody got cheesy feet back there? Mosquitoes love that smell. So we focused on the feet, and we collected the body odor. Now when it comes to mosquitoes and olfaction, their sense of smell, it's very complex. It would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected, but it's not that simple. They have to detect a number of chemicals in the right concentration, the right ratios, the right combinations of chemicals. So you can sort of think about it like a musical composition. So, you know, if you get the note wrong or you play it too loud or too soft, it doesn't sound right. Or a recipe: if you get an ingredient wrong or you cook it too long or too little, it doesn't taste right. Well, smell is the same. It's made up of a suite of chemicals in the right combination."", '09:22': ""Now our machines in the lab are not particularly good at picking out this sort of signal -- it's quite complex. But animals can, and what we do in my laboratory is we connect microelectrodes to the antennae of a mosquito. Imagine how fiddly that is."", '09:39': '(Laughter)', '09:40': ""But what we also do is connect them to individual cells within the antennae, which is incredible. You don't want to sneeze when you're doing this, that's for sure. But what this does is it allows us to measure the electrical response of the smell receptors in the antennae, and so we can see what a mosquito is smelling."", '09:58': ""So I'm going to show you what this looks like. Here's an insect's cell, and it will respond in a second when I press this button, and you'll see it sort of ticking over with this response. An odor will be blown over the cell, and it will go a bit crazy, sort of blow a raspberry, and then it will go back to its resting potential when we stop the odor."", '10:15': '(Rapid crackling)', '10:22': '(Low-pitch crackling)', '10:28': '(Rapid crackling)', '10:35': ""OK, there we go, so you can go home now and say that you've seen an insect smelling and even hearing an insect smelling -- it's a weird concept, isn't it? But this works really well, and this allows us to see what the insect is detecting. Now using this method with our malaria samples, we were able to find out what the mosquito was detecting, and we found the malaria-associated compounds, mainly aldehydes, a group of compounds that smelled, that signified the malaria signal here. So now we know what the smell of malaria is, and we've used the mosquito as a biosensor to tell us what the smell of malaria actually is."", '11:10': ""Now I'd like to imagine that you could, I don't know, put a harness on a little mosquito and put it on a lead and take it out and see if we can sniff people in a community -- that goes on in my head -- and see whether we could actually find people with malaria, but, of course, that's not really possible. But there is an animal that we can do that with."", '11:33': ""Now dogs have an incredible sense of smell, but there's something more special about them: they have an ability to learn. And most of you people will be familiar with this concept at airports, where dogs will go down a line and sniff out your luggage or yourself for drugs and explosives or even food as well."", '11:51': ""So we wanted to know, could we actually train dogs to learn the smell of malaria? And so we've been working with a charity called Medical Detection Dogs to see whether we can train them to learn the smell of malaria. And we went out to the Gambia and did some more odor collection on children that were infected and uninfected, but this time, we collected their odor by making them wear socks, nylon stockings, to collect their body odor. And we brought them back to the UK and then we handed them to this charity to run the experiment. Now I could show you a graph and tell you about that experiment works, but that'd be a bit dull, wouldn't it."", '12:32': ""Now, they do say never work with children or animals live, but we're going to break that rule today. So please welcome onto the stage Freya ..."", '12:44': '(Applause)', '12:46': 'and her trainers Mark and Sarah.', '12:51': '(Applause)', '12:54': 'Of course, this is the real star of the show.', '12:56': '(Laughter)', '12:57': ""OK, so now what I'm going to ask is if you can all just be a little bit quiet, not move around too much. This is a very, very strange environment for Freya. She's having a good look at you guys now. So let's stay as calm as possible. That would be great. So what we're going to do here is basically, we're going to ask Freya to move down this line of contraptions here, and in each one of these contraptions, we have a pot, and in the pot is a sock that has been worn by a child in the Gambia. Now three of the socks have been worn by children who were uninfected, and just one of the socks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria. So just as you would see an airport, imagine these were people, and the dog is going to go down and have a good sniff. And let's see if you can see when she senses the malaria, and if she senses the malaria. This is a really tough test for her in this very strange environment, so I'm going to hand it over now to Mark."", '14:05': '(Laughs) Number three. OK.', '14:08': '(Applause)', '14:09': ""There we go. I didn't know which pot that was in. Mark didn't know. This was a blind test, genuinely. Sarah, was that correct? Sarah: Yes."", '14:17': 'JL: That was correct. Well done, Freya. That is fantastic. Whew.', '14:21': '(Applause)', '14:23': ""That is really wonderful. Now Sarah is going to actually change the pots around a little bit, and she's going to take the one with malaria away, and we're just going to have four pots that are containing socks from children that had no malaria, so in theory, Freya should go down the line and not stop at all. And this is really important, because we also need to know people who are not infected, she needs to be able to do that. And this is a tough test. These socks have been in the freezer for a couple of years now, and this is a tiny bit of a sock as well. So imagine if this was a whole person, giving off a big signal. So this is really incredible. OK, over to you, Mark."", '15:07': '(Laughs)', '15:08': '(Applause)', '15:09': 'Brilliant. Fantastic.', '15:11': '(Applause)', '15:14': 'Really super. Thank you so much, guys. Big round of applause for Freya, Mark and Sarah. Well done, guys.', '15:20': '(Applause)', '15:22': ""What a good girl. She's going to get a treat later. Fantastic."", '15:28': ""So you've just seen that for your own eyes. That was a real live demonstration. I was quite nervous about it. I'm so glad that it worked."", '15:35': '(Laughter)', '15:37': ""But it is really incredible, and when we do this, what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody is infected with malaria 81 percent of the time. It's incredible. 92 percent of the time, they can tell us correctly when somebody does not have an infection. And those numbers are actually above the criteria set by the World Health Organization for a diagnostic. So we really are looking at deploying dogs in countries, and particularly at ports of entry, to detect people who have malaria. This could be a reality."", '16:10': ""But we can't deploy dogs everywhere, and so what we're also looking to do and working on at the moment is the development of technology, wearable tech that would empower the individual to allow them to self-diagnose. Imagine a patch that you wear on the skin that would detect in your sweat when you're infected with malaria and change color. Or something a little more technical, perhaps: a smartwatch that would alert you when you're infected with malaria. And if we can do this digitally, and we can collect data, imagine the amount of data that we can collect on a global scale. This could completely revolutionize the way that we track the spread of diseases, the way that we target our control efforts and respond to disease outbreaks, ultimately helping to lead to the eradication of malaria, and even beyond malaria, for other diseases that we already know have a smell. If we can harness the power of nature to find out what those smells are, we could do this and make this a reality."", '17:10': ""Now, as scientists, we're tasked with coming up with new ideas, new concepts, new technologies to tackle some of the world's greatest problems, but what never ceases to amaze me is that often nature has already done this for us, and the answer ... is right under our nose."", '17:32': 'Thank you.', '17:34': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This patient had a rapidly growing cancer in his neck, and then came down with an unrelated bacterial skin infection. But soon, something unexpected happened: as he recovered from the infection, the cancer also began to recede. When a physician named William Coley tracked the patient down 7 years later, no visible signs of the cancer remained. Coley believed something remarkable was happening: that the bacterial infection had stimulated the patient’s immune system to fight off the cancer.', '00:49': 'Coley’s fortunate discovery led him to pioneer the intentional injection of bacteria to successfully treat cancer. Over a century later, synthetic biologists have found an even better way to use these once unlikely allies— by programming them to safely deliver drugs directly to tumors.', '01:10': 'Cancer occurs when normal functions of cells are altered, causing them to rapidly multiply and form growths called tumors. Treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy attempt to kill malignant cells, but can affect the entire body and disrupt healthy tissues in the process.', '01:29': 'However, some bacteria like E. coli have the unique advantage of being able to selectively grow inside tumors. In fact, the core of a tumor forms an ideal environment where they can safely multiply, hidden from immune cells. Instead of causing infection, bacteria can be reprogrammed to carry cancer-fighting drugs, acting as Trojan Horses that target the tumor from within. This idea of programming bacteria to sense and respond in novel ways is a major focus of a field called Synthetic Biology.', '02:05': 'But how can bacteria be programmed? The key lies in manipulating their DNA. By inserting particular genetic sequences into bacteria, they can be instructed to synthesize different molecules, including those that disrupt cancer growth. They can also be made to behave in very specific ways with the help of biological circuits. These program different behaviors depending on the presence, absence, or combination of certain factors. For example, tumors have low oxygen and pH levels and over-produce specific molecules. Synthetic biologists can program bacteria to sense those conditions, and by doing so, respond to tumors while avoiding healthy tissue.', '02:50': 'One type of biological circuit, known as a synchronized lysis circuit, or SLC, allows bacteria to not only deliver medicine, but to do so on a set schedule. First, to avoid harming healthy tissue, production of anti-cancer drugs begins as bacteria grow, which only happens within the tumor itself. Next, after they’ve produced the drugs, a kill-switch causes the bacteria to burst when they reach a critical population threshold. This both releases the medicine and decreases the bacteria’s population. However, a certain percentage of the bacteria remain alive to replenish the colony. Eventually their numbers grow large enough to trigger the kill switch again, and the cycle continues. This circuit can be fine-tuned to deliver drugs on whatever periodic schedule is best to fight the cancer.', '03:43': 'This approach has proven promising in scientific trials using mice. Not only were scientists able to successfully eliminate lymphoma tumors injected with bacteria, but the injection also stimulated the immune system, priming immune cells to identify and attack untreated lymphomas elsewhere in the mouse.', '04:03': 'Unlike many other therapies, bacteria don’t target a specific type of cancer, but rather the general characteristics shared by all solid tumors. Nor are programmable bacteria limited to simply fighting cancer. Instead, they can serve as sophisticated sensors that monitor sites of future disease. Safe probiotic bacteria could perhaps lie dormant within our guts, where they’d detect, prevent, and treat disorders before they have the chance to cause symptoms.', '04:34': 'Advances in technology have created excitement around a future of personalized medicine driven by mechanical nanobots. But thanks to billions of years of evolution we may already have a starting point in the unexpectedly biological form of bacteria. Add synthetic biology to the mix, and who knows what might soon be possible.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I am excited for a world where our entertainment could connect us instead of isolating us -- a world where we can bond with each other over our shared interests and create real, strong communities,"" Shear says.",0:14:47,14.78333333,290882,2019-09-16T14:56:07+00:00,"['community', 'Internet', 'gaming', 'entertainment', 'society', 'technology', 'social change']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'ગુજરાતી', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Emmett Shear,"Entrepreneur, investor","{'00:05': ""I am obsessed with forming healthy communities, and that's why I started Twitch -- to help people watch other people play video games on the internet."", '00:14': '(Laughter)', '00:16': 'Thank you for coming to my TED talk.', '00:18': '(Laughter)', '00:19': ""So in seriousness, video games and communities truly are quite related. From our early human history, we made our entertainment together in small tribes. We shared stories around the campfire, we sang together, we danced together. Our earliest entertainment was both shared and interactive. It wasn't until pretty recently on the grand scale of human history that interactivity took a back seat and broadcast entertainment took over."", '00:51': ""Radio and records brought music into our vehicles, into our homes. TV and VHS brought sports and drama into our living rooms. This access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented. It gave people amazing content around the globe. It created a shared culture for millions of people. And now, if you want to go watch or listen to Mozart, you don't have to buy an incredibly expensive ticket and find an orchestra. And if you like to sing -- (Sings) I can show you the world -- then you have something in common with people around the world. But with this amazing access, we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer, and the relationship between the two became much more one-way. We wound up in a world where we had a smaller class of professional creators and most of us became spectators, and as a result it became far easier for us to enjoy that content alone."", '02:06': ""There's a trend counteracting this: scarcity. So, Vienna in the 1900s, was famous for its café culture. And one of the big drivers of that café culture was expensive newspapers that were hard to get, and as a result, people would go to the café and read the shared copy there. And once they're in the cafe, they meet the other people also reading the same newspaper, they converse, they exchange ideas and they form a community. In a similar way, TV and cable used to be more expensive, and so you might not watch the game at home. Instead you'd go to the local bar and cheer along with your fellow sports fans there. But as the price of media continues to fall over time thanks to technology, this shared necessity that used to bring our communities together falls away. We have so many amazing options for our entertainment, and yet it's easier than ever for us to wind up consuming those options alone. Our communities are bearing the consequences. For example, the number of people who report having at least two close friends is at an all-time low. I believe that one of the major contributing causes to this is that our entertainment today allows us to be separate."", '03:38': ""There is one trend reversing this atomization of our society: modern multiplayer video games. Games are like a shared campfire. They're both interactive and connecting. Now these campfires may have beautiful animations, heroic quests, occasionally too many loot boxes, but games today are very different than the solitary activity of 20 years ago. They're deeply complex, they're more intellectually stimulating, and most of all, they're intrinsically social."", '04:16': 'One of the recent breakout genres exemplifying this change is the battle royale. 100 people parachute onto an island in a last-man-standing competition. Think of it as being kind of like ""American Idol,"" but with a lot more fighting and a lot less Simon Cowell. You may have heard of ""Fortnite,"" which is a breakout example of the battle royale genre, which has been played by more than 250 million people around the world. It\'s everyone from kids in your neighborhood to Drake and Ellen DeGeneres. 2.3 billion people in the world play video games. Early games like ""Tetris"" and ""Mario"" may have been simple puzzles or quests, but with the rise of arcades and then internet play, and now massively multiplayer games of huge, thriving online communities, games have emerged as the one form of entertainment where consumption truly requires human connection.', '05:14': 'So this brings us to streaming. Why do people stream themselves playing video games? And why do hundreds of millions of people around the world congregate to watch them? I want you all the imagine for second -- imagine you land on an alien planet, and on this planet, there\'s a giant green rectangle. And in this green rectangle, aliens in matching outfits are trying to push a checkered sphere between two posts using only their feet. It\'s pretty evenly matched, so the ball is just going back and forth, but there\'s hundreds of millions of people watching from home anyway, and cheering and getting excited and engaged right along with them. Now I grew up watching sports with my dad, so I get why soccer is entertaining and engaging. But if you don\'t watch sports, maybe you like watching ""Dancing with the Stars"" or you enjoy ""Top Chef."" Regardless, the principle is the same. If there is an activity that you really enjoy, you\'re probably going to like watching other people do it with skill and panache. It might be perplexing to an alien, but bonding over shared passion is a human universal.', '06:29': ""So gamers grew up expecting this live, interactive entertainment, and passive consumption just doesn't feel as fulfilling. That's why livestreaming has taken off with video games. Because livestreaming offers that same kind of interactive feeling. So when you imagine what's happening on Twitch, I don't want you to think of a million livestreams of video games. Instead, what I want you to picture is millions of campfires. Some of them are bonfires -- huge, roaring bonfires with hundreds of thousands of people around them. Some of them are smaller, more intimate community gatherings where everyone knows your name."", '07:20': ""Let's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now. Hey Cohh, how's it going?"", '07:29': ""Cohh: Hey, how's it going, Emmett?"", '07:30': ""ES: So I'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends, and we thought we'd come and join you guys for a little stream."", '07:39': ""Cohh: Awesome! It's great to hear from you guys."", '07:41': 'ES: So Cohh, can you share with the TED audience here -- what have you learned about your community on Twitch?', '07:48': 'Cohh: Ah, man, where to begin? I\'ve been doing this for over five years now, and if there\'s one thing that doesn\'t cease to impress me on the daily, it\'s just kind of how incredible this whole thing is for communication. I\'ve been playing games for 20 years of my life, I\'ve led online MMO guilds for over 10, and it\'s the kind of thing where there\'s very few places in life where you can go to meet so many people with similar interests. I was listening in a bit earlier; I love the campfire analogy, I actually use a similar one. I see it all as a bunch of people on a big couch but only one person has the controller. So it\'s kind of like a ""Pass the snack!"" situation, you know? 700 people that way -- but it\'s great and really it\'s just --', '08:32': ""ES: So Cohh, what is going on in chat right now? Can you explain that a little bit to us? Because my eyesight isn't that good but I see a lot of emotes."", '08:42': 'Cohh: So this is my community; this is the Cohhilition. I stream every single day. I actually just wrapped up a 2,000-day challenge, and as such, we have developed a pretty incredible community here in the channel. Right now we have about 6200 people with us. What you\'re seeing is a spam of ""Hello, TED"" good-vibe emotes, love emotes, ""this is awesome,"" ""Hi, guys,"" ""Hi, everyone."" Basically just a huge collection of people -- huge collection of gamers that are all just experiencing a positive event together.', '09:11': 'ES: So is there anything that -- can we poll chat? I want ask chat a question. Is there anything that chat would like the world, and particularly these people here with me at TED right now, to know about what they get out of playing video games and being part of this community?', '09:28': 'Cohh: Oh, wow. I am already starting to see a lot of answers here. ""I like the good vibes."" ""Best communities are on Twitch.""', '09:41': '(Laughter)', '09:43': '""They get us through the rough patches in life."" Oh, that\'s a message I definitely see a lot on Twitch, which is very good. ""A very positive community,"" ""a lot of positivity,"" which is pretty great.', '09:57': 'ES: So Cohh, before I get back to my TED talk, which I actually should probably get back to doing at some point --', '10:05': '(Laughter)', '10:06': ""Do you have anything else that you want to share with me or any question you wanted to ask, you've always wanted to get out there before an audience?"", '10:14': ""Cohh: Honestly, not too much. I mean, I absolutely love what you're doing right now. I think that the interactive streaming is the big unexplored frontier of the future in entertainment, and thank you for doing everything you're doing up there. The more people that hear about what you do, the better -- for everyone on here."", '10:30': ""ES: Awesome, Cohh. Thanks so much. I'm going to get back to giving this talk now, but we should catch up later."", '10:35': 'Cohh: Sounds great!', '10:36': '(Applause)', '10:41': 'ES: So that was a new way to interact. We could influence what happened on the stream, we could cocreate the experience along with him, and we really had a multiplayer experience with chat and with Cohh. At Twitch, we\'ve started calling this, as a result, ""multiplayer entertainment."" Because going from watching a video alone to watching a live interactive stream is similar to the difference between going from playing a single-player game to playing a multiplayer game. Gamers are often as the forefront of exploration in new technology. Microcomputers, for example, were used early on for video games, and the very first handheld, digital mass-market devices weren\'t cell phones, they were Gameboys ... for video games. And as a result, one way that you can get a hint of what the future might hold is to look to this fun, interactive sandbox of video games and ask yourself, ""what are these gamers doing today?"" And that might give you a hint as to what the future is going to hold for all of us.', '12:08': 'One of the things we\'re already seeing on Twitch is multiplayer entertainment coming to sports. So, Twitch and the NFL teamed up to offer livestreaming football, but instead of network announcers in suits streaming the game, we got Twitch users to come in and stream it themselves on their own channel and interact with their community and make it a real multiplayer experience. So I actually think that if you look out into the future -- only hundreds of people today get to be sports announcers. It\'s a tiny, tiny number of people who have that opportunity. But sports are about to go multiplayer, and that means that anyone who wants to around the world is going to get the opportunity to become a sports announcer, to give it a shot. And I think that\'s going to unlock incredible amounts of new talent for all of us. And we\'re not going to be asking, ""Did you catch the game?"" Instead, we\'re going to be asking, ""Whose channel did you catch the game on?"" We already see this happening with cooking, with singing -- we even see people streaming welding. And all of this stuff is going to happen around the metaphorical campfire.', '13:30': ""There's going to be millions of these campfires lit over the next few years. And on every topic, you're going to be able to find a campfire that will allow you to bond with your people around the world. For most of human history, entertainment was simply multiplayer. We sang together in person, we shared news together in the town square in person, and somewhere along the way, that two-way conversation turned into a one-way transmission. As someone who cares about communities, I am excited for a world where our entertainment could connect us instead of isolating us. A world where we can bond with each other over our shared interests and create real, strong communities. Games, streams and the interactions they encourage, are only just beginning to turn the wheel back to our interactive, community-rich, multiplayer past."", '14:35': 'Thank you all for sharing this experience here with me, and may you all find your best campfire.', '14:41': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And all of these bits of information can be used to come up with a hypothesis, a story, essentially, of how a molecule might work.', '01:26': 'My job is to take these ideas and turn them into an animation. This can be tricky, because it turns out that molecules can do some pretty crazy things. But these animations can be incredibly useful for researchers to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work. They can also allow us to see the molecular world through their eyes.', '01:45': ""I'd like to show you some animations, a brief tour of what I consider to be some of the natural wonders of the molecular world. First off, this is an immune cell. These kinds of cells need to go crawling around in our bodies in order to find invaders like pathogenic bacteria. This movement is powered by one of my favorite proteins called actin, which is part of what's known as the cytoskeleton. Unlike our skeletons, actin filaments are constantly being built and taken apart. The actin cytoskeleton plays incredibly important roles in our cells. They allow them to change shape, to move around, to adhere to surfaces and also to gobble up bacteria."", '02:23': 'Actin is also involved in a different kind of movement. In our muscle cells, actin structures form these regular filaments that look kind of like fabric. When our muscles contract, these filaments are pulled together and they go back to their original position when our muscles relax.', '02:37': ""Other parts of the cytoskeleton, in this case microtubules, are responsible for long-range transportation. They can be thought of as basically cellular highways that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the other. Unlike our roads, microtubules grow and shrink, appearing when they're needed and disappearing when their job is done."", '02:55': 'The molecular version of semitrucks are proteins aptly named motor proteins, that can walk along microtubules, dragging sometimes huge cargoes, like organelles, behind them. This particular motor protein is known as dynein, and its known to be able to work together in groups that almost look, at least to me, like a chariot of horses.', '03:16': ""As you see, the cell is this incredibly changing, dynamic place, where things are constantly being built and disassembled. But some of these structures are harder to take apart than others, though. And special forces need to be brought in in order to make sure that structures are taken apart in a timely manner. That job is done in part by proteins like these. These donut-shaped proteins, of which there are many types in the cell, all seem to act to rip apart structures by basically pulling individual proteins through a central hole. When these kinds of proteins don't work properly, the types of proteins that are supposed to get taken apart can sometimes stick together and aggregate and that can give rise to terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's."", '03:56': ""And now let's take a look at the nucleus, which houses our genome in the form of DNA. In all of our cells, our DNA is cared for and maintained by a diverse set of proteins. DNA is wound around proteins called histones, which enable cells to pack large amounts of DNA into our nucleus. These machines are called chromatin remodelers, and the way they work is that they basically scoot the DNA around these histones and they allow new pieces of DNA to become exposed. This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery. In this case, this large molecular machine is looking for a segment of DNA that tells it it's at the beginning of a gene. Once it finds a segment, it basically undergoes a series of shape changes which enables it to bring in other machinery that in turn allows a gene to get turned on or transcribed. This has to be a very tightly regulated process, because turning on the wrong gene at the wrong time can have disastrous consequences."", '04:54': ""Scientists are now able to use protein machines to edit genomes. I'm sure all of you have heard of CRISPR. CRISPR takes advantage of a protein known as Cas9, which can be engineered to recognize and cut a very specific sequence of DNA. In this example, two Cas9 proteins are being used to excise a problematic piece of DNA. For example, a part of a gene that may give rise to a disease. Cellular machinery is then used to basically glue two ends of the DNA back together."", '05:23': ""As a molecular animator, one of my biggest challenges is visualizing uncertainty. All of the animations I've shown to you represent hypotheses, how my collaborators think a process works, based on the best information that they have. But for a lot of molecular processes, we're still really at the early stages of understanding things, and there's a lot to learn. The truth is that these invisible molecular worlds are vast and largely unexplored. To me, these molecular landscapes are just as exciting to explore as a natural world that's visible all around us."", '05:56': 'Thank you.', '05:58': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_the_long_now,The Long Now,"Stewart Brand works on the Clock of the Long Now, a timepiece that counts down the next 10,000 years. It's a beautiful project that asks us to think about the far, far future. Here, he discusses a tricky side problem with the Clock: Where can we put it?",0:23:11,23.18333333,287726,2008-11-17T07:16:00+00:00,"['architecture', 'art', 'design', 'future', 'technology']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Stewart Brand,"Environmentalist, futurist","{'00:04': 'Welcome to 10,000 feet. Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you. Once upon a time, I did a book called ""How Buildings Learn."" Today\'s event you might call ""How Mountains Teach."" A little background: For 10 years I\'ve been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases, non-existent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know, next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization\'s story so far.', '00:50': ""So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago. It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London, and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there."", '01:39': ""So the design problem for today is going to be, how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries? Well, this was the first solution. Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building? Well, this is what deep time does to a building. This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever, because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones. And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable. Even the most durable and intactable buildings, like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out. And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things."", '02:40': ""So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building, where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground. How about underground with a view? Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain. You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years. So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain, so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest. We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona."", '03:20': ""Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service, led us to Eastern Nevada, to America's newest and oldest national park, which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada. It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet. And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep, and on the right it's gentle. This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad. And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50."", '04:01': ""Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park. Inside the green line is national forest. And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle, this vertical, was available because it was private land. And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here, who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land. And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there."", '04:35': ""We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top. Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a 2,000-foot thick formation, and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain, and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us."", '05:20': ""Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work. It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest. Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone, it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented, maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. Then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there."", '06:14': 'Now Brian Eno, who\'s been in the thick of the Long Now process, spent two years making a C.D. called ""January 7003,"" and it\'s ""Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."" Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed, so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years. The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number. And in fact, pretty soon we\'ll hear the sound. January 7003. There it is.', '06:47': ""OK, back to Danny's list. Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to. And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect. Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world, so you have time to assimilate what you've learned.  And then, how about a memento? Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical, a kind of reward that you take away. It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours. How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about? This is not a normal building project. What do you look for? What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?"", '07:40': ""Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here, that's national park. That's sacrosanct -- you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest. There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation. And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines. They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true. There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time. So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain, some of them go back 10,000 years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful, sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there. We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition."", '08:44': 'Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy, now\'s a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end. That\'s interesting. You\'ll find out why it\'s called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.  Here\'s Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered, led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline, and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called, ""Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."" And then, based on that principle, he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline, and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old. Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.', '09:44': 'OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines. Because the owner said, ""There\'s one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."" And we said, ""Wow, that\'s great. Listen, we\'ll counter. How about zero?', '10:07': '(Laughter)', '10:09': ""And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction."", '10:16': '(Laughter)', '10:19': 'All you have to do is prove to the government it\'s worth a billion dollars.""', '10:22': ""Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars. This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten, a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was. But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that, as you'll see when we go inside in a minute, we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock. Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring, and so parts of it are caved in in there."", '11:08': ""That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property, and it dates back to 1870. That's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine. In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada, and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet. You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena,  which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any. They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine."", '11:58': ""It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon. And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there. Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite, but it's something to think about. They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather. Way more interesting than Monterey even today."", '12:28': ""And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were. Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again, thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there. And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin, who's the regional head of the National Forest Service, and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there. We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit."", '12:58': '(Laughter)', '13:00': ""The weather station's pretty interesting. Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco, where we put the data in real time up on our website. And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches. As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington, just a few old mining roads like this, so you have to bushwhack everywhere. But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak, and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time.  You can hike for days and not encounter anybody."", '13:55': ""Well, here's a potential approach. You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon. It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs, and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom, until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem. So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain. You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley, it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet. And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet, where there's a bit of a problem."", '14:44': 'Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition, ""Make the clock inaccessible. The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."" And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there. So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route, and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain. Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --', '15:18': '(Laughter)', '15:20': ""but your emotional affect goes up, which is great for having a mythic experience,  whether you want to or not. In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head."", '15:33': '(Laughter)', '15:36': 'Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,  ""There\'s a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."" Now, he\'s a rock climber, but you know, he\'s our executive director. I don\'t want him killed. I know he\'s going to love cliffs. I\'m saying, ""Be careful, be careful, be careful."" Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is, ""I\'m half-way up. It\'s like climbing stairs. I\'m going up 60 degrees. It\'s a secret passage. It\'s like something from Tolkien."" And I\'m going, ""Careful, careful. Please be careful."" And then, of course, the next thing I hear is, ""I\'ve made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."" And he dashed across the top of the mountains.', '16:20': ""In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose. First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington, and a solo ascent at that. This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them. We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered. How about Zander's Crevice? No."", '16:42': '(Laughter)', '16:46': ""So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq. Zander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra, there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq, and so this is the Siq. And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image, and I'm not sure you can. Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there, and that brings it out."", '17:08': ""Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day, and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs, which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it, and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. And the people toiling up the mountain could see them, these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff. How did they get there? Do I have to do that? And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth. You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.  And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day, and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on, the clock will keep perfectly good time."", '18:09': ""So here we're looking from the south, look north. This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs, that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon. And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite. Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs, it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot, there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. That's what it looks like looking down it. We should probably put in a rail or something. Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see. And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like. You also see there a bighorn sheep. Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble."", '19:20': ""This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. because the real peak is hidden around the corner. This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest. And as it turned out the answer is, yes, that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak, and that might be conjured with. We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this. One is the experience of the mountain. Another is the experience in the mountain. And the third is the experience from the mountain, which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny, and if you look off to the right, out there, 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range."", '20:15': ""In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch, and I'll take you there for a minute. It's a very nice ranch. Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham, and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work. And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going. This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the valley used to look like. This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years."", '21:00': ""And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley, because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,  and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition, and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park, and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell."", '21:30': ""OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself. The clock experience should be profound, but from the outside it should be invisible. Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave. It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside? You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it. And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in, that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite. And this stone takes a perfect polish. You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock."", '22:12': 'And it\'s not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain, and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside.  This is architecture not made by building, but by what you very carefully take away. So that\'s what the mountain taught us. Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them. It\'s not a clock in a mountain -- it\'s a mountain clock. Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything. They say, ""pin peya obe"" -- welcome to the mountain.', '23:03': 'Thank you.', '23:05': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube, the first interactive cable TV system, and the New York Times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home, convergence, great things are happening. Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures -- Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision. By the way, this is about when I enter the picture. I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner. That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer -- I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out. Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money. And I had a happy brush with convergence until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing."", '02:49': ""That's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are, almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer. Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars. Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s. But they were onto something and they got better at it. By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL, and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet."", '03:33': '(Laughter)', '03:34': ""Now, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities, or the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently. You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world, about total transformation. For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking, you know, who else talks that way? And the answer is pretty clearly -- it's people in religion and in politics."", '04:03': ""And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood, not as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement. We promise something great, we evangelize it, we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well, and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again, as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment. But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing."", '04:27': ""So, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment, how did we get here? I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media?"", '04:39': ""Of course, the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems, but things got really interesting just a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind, built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy, but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star. So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers, and the computer begins to express itself."", '05:12': ""(Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer. With considerable trepidation, we undertake to interview this new machine."", '05:19': 'Jay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge. And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. Would you like if I used the machine?', '05:29': ""Journalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester. Since this computer was made in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research, why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster, give Whirlwind the workout?"", '05:42': ""Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket. This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky. Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption, I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine, at any instant, say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining, and the velocity at that set instant. JF: Over on the left-hand side, you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off. And on the right-hand side, there's a scale that shows the rocket's velocity. The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at. And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory, the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum. Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground."", '06:39': ""How's that? Journalist: What about that, Admiral? CB: Looks very good to me."", '06:45': 'JF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)', '07:02': 'Journalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.', '07:07': ""PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction, the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer, but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy, and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence."", '07:24': ""Enter the atomic bomb. We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever, and knowing a good thing when it sees it, the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us. They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system, deploy it all across the frozen north, and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place. Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry. And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman. Here's their marketing video."", '08:05': '(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks. And then it would be too late to act. We cannot afford to take that chance. It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system, to strengthen our air defenses. This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network, is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid. It is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel-driven generators, air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.', '09:00': ""PH: You know, that one computer was huge. There's an interesting marketing lesson from it, which is basically, when you market a product, you can either say, this is going to be wonderful, it will make you feel better and enliven you. Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die. This is a really good example of that."", '09:18': ""This had the first pointing device. It was distributed, so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other. About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing, and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes. You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this -- because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small at this conference, so let's talk about making things large. If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know, say, Century City, it would fit beautifully. You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there."", '09:53': ""But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor, the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow. To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland, and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. And then, the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles. That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates. So, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not. So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs. But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has, and the reasons these transformations are happening."", '10:37': 'All of this stuff starts moving into industry. DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer. It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens. Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden, interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out. Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing, and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out. DEC knew a good thing about wasting time. It shipped every one of its computers with that game.', '11:08': 'Meanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-\'50s, the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely. A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they\'re quite certain that television is about to do them in. In fact, despair is in the air. And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything I\'ve been reading all week. RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio, said this, ""I don\'t say that radio networks must die. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern, new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues. It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio, but I don\'t know how."" And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively, producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea. And they fake it.', '12:17': ""(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set, you just get them out. First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out. Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this. That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls. Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set, and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this. Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons and your erasing glove, because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that. You all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man. Come on into the secret lab."", '12:47': 'PH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits. Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you\'re saying. ""Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon, why do I have to buy theirs?"" I assure you, that\'s not the case. Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window, other crayons may discolor or hurt the window. This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere. It led to lawsuits --', '13:26': '(Laughter) --', '13:27': ""federal investigations, and lots of repercussions, and that's a scandal we won't discuss today."", '13:33': 'But we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of ""Winky Dink,"" went on to become the host of ""Twenty One,"" one of the most important quiz shows ever. And it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man, Charles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak, ending Berry\'s career. And actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS. It turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked.', '13:59': ""And 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media, there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from, Professor Marshall McLuhan. He actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications. Here he is talking from the 1960s."", '14:20': ""(Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows. They were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do. They were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged. Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers."", '14:44': ""PH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village. If you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today, it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him."", '14:55': ""(Video) MM: The global village is a world in which you don't necessarily have harmony. You have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life. It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large. And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet, but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs. And so the global village is as big as a planet, and as small as a village post office."", '15:26': ""PH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later. We're now right into the 1960s. It's the era of big business and data centers for computing. But all that was about to change. You know, the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations, it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do. But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it to America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff."", '15:53': ""(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing? Everything. It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing, at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975. In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks, a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy, a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world. Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture, but while he was beginning to do his work, all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula. There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments and other areas around the campus, and there was music literally in the streets. The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors. People were leaving to go back to the land. There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation. There was women's liberation. This was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time. And into that ferment came the microprocessor."", '16:57': 'I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing. They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build. And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information. I think these ideas are difficult to understand, because when you\'re trapped in one paradigm, the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense. The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them. The title of the book is, ""What the Dormouse Said: How the \'60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."" The title was taken from the lyrics to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go, ""Remember what the dormouse said. Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head."" (Music)', '18:30': ""PH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory, and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined in Cambridge and Silicon Valley. Here's the Architecture Machine Group, the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981. Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff. HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks, where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture, or piece of text, or data across a file system, and we had no way of explaining it. There was no metaphor. Was it a database? A prototyping tool? A scripted language? Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure."", '19:06': ""We asked a question about how the mind works, and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant. A few years later, we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want, the way you want it and the easy way? Here's the Apple marketing video."", '19:27': ""(Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several ways to create a HyperCard interactive video. The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks. By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier. The method we illustrate in this video uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks. This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests."", '19:58': ""PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is. That's like a Dick Cheney speech. You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff, mash it up, tell the story your way. Now, as long as we confine this to the education market, and a personal matter between the computer and the file system, that's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti and a lot of other people."", '20:22': ""By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out. It became a killer app of links, and today, of course, we call that the World Wide Web. Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet, but a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing. The year is 1993 and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this. We were plenty aware that we were messing with media, and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things, but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look."", '21:15': ""(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all. Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology, the Digital Superhighway. Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians. The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century. Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible. The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell. Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company! Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising, David Sarnoff commercializes radio.

Well, you know where we're going on from here. We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web, and I don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together. But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0, things actually are quite different. And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.

As an emissary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama to meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests throughout the South. When a jury failed to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice for all of our citizens.”', '01:01': 'Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price.', '01:13': 'Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter of the NAACP; a role many avoided for fear of persecution.', '01:46': 'At first Raymond was eager to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes for their meetings, and soon found herself elected secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life.', '02:15': 'By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter, battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP youth group council, she helped young people navigate segregated systems including voter registration and whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience training and spoke out against racial violence, particularly the murder of Emmet Till.', '03:11': 'In 1955, her refusal to move to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred and eighty-one days.', '03:31': 'Park’s simple act had transformed nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating public transport. But this victory for the movement had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery because of her political reputation.', '03:56': 'In 1957, she moved to Detroit to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman John Conyers to help support his burgeoning civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial inequality, Parks remained active for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks to support other activists, and established an institute for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done does away with fear.”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I soon realized that it was floating in from all over the world."", '00:31': ""I've since returned, after that first journey, several times a year to visit Sian Ka'an, to the country of my birth, to work with this trash.

In red, you see all of the countries represented by their trash in Sian Ka'an. Such as these Haitian butter containers in all shapes and sizes, Jamaican water bottles. Not surprisingly, a lot of the stuff is from neighboring Caribbean countries, but the stuff is from everywhere. Here's a sampling of international water bottles. And one of the ironies is that a lot of what I'm finding are products for cleaning and beautification, such as this item from the United States, which is actually made to protect your plastic,"", '01:29': '(Laughter)', '01:31': ""shampoo from South Korea, bleach from Costa Rica and a Norwegian toilet cleaner.

I noticed that blue was the most prevalent color among the plastic. Purple is actually the most rare color. It's kind of like gold to me. But blue is the most prevalent, and so I gathered some of the blues and made this little arrangement in front of the blue sky and blue Caribbean waters. And when I took a photograph and looked at the test shot, it was like a lightning bolt hit me in that moment, and I knew I was going to have to come back to create a whole series of installations on location and photograph them."", '03:02': ""So this turned out to be a sketch for a work that I completed three years later.

I was told by some that it could be damaged goods after traveling across the ocean and being exposed to the elements, that it could become degraded and potentially ruin a batch of recycling. The landfill was not a happy resting place, either. And then finally, it dawned on me, after all of the effort by me and all of the people who have helped me collect and organize and clean this trash, that I should keep it.

The baby who is the exact same age as the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over 30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time to speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: Saleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related to the time of his birth.', '01:18': 'And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around the stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, a spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, a gifted warrior.', '01:35': 'With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a vast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step through time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender when immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins.', '01:53': 'Saleem acts as a delightful guide to magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day of celebration, it also marks a turbulent period in Indian history.', '02:07': 'In 1948, the leader of the Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided with Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India and Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment of Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi.', '02:42': 'This vast historical frame is one reason why ""Midnight’s Children"" is considered one of the most illuminating works of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the experience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes like revolution, migration, and identity.', '03:06': 'Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947, was educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental histories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches ""Midnight’s Children"" with a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, religion and folktales.', '03:33': 'Scribbling by night under the watchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes that of ""1001 Nights,"" where a woman named Scheherazade tells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, of alternative realities.”', '03:58': ""Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with multiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading a rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in- the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I’ve gone which would not have happened if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six- hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you’ll have to swallow a world.”"", '04:44': 'Saleem’s narrative often has a breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the cosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever condense history into a single narrative.', '04:58': 'His mind-bending plot and shapeshifting characters have garnered continuing fascination and praise.

A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s favorite folktales. But one of its most famous renditions tells the story without a single word. Since premiering in 1890, ""The Sleeping Beauty"" has become one of the most frequently staged ballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring to this— or any other story?', '00:44': 'At the heart of ballet are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect over thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning and history. But you don’t need to study them to understand ballet, any more than you need to study music to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures together with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s live score, ballerinas precisely perform these combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character.', '01:22': 'In ""The Sleeping Beauty’s"" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking of violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill with an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts of electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés before decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal than this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy counters that curse.', '02:13': 'Of course, the relationship between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers and orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge from the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation of speed and rhythm.', '02:42': 'But prior to the performance, a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer and the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second of ""The Sleeping Beauty."" This is particularly noticeable in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical phrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for ""cat steps""— as she waits for her party to begin.', '03:21': 'Once the celebration starts, it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing these gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: her famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array of balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display of physical strength and skill.', '03:49': 'However, it’s not just technique that carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements to convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence from her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious, descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence.', '04:11': '""The Sleeping Beauty"" offers a showcase for so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes of this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium for stories old and new.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But before I do that, we have to go over the definition of what green is, 'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it. Green. The product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means. There's plenty of things that are being called green now. What does it actually mean? We use three metrics to determine green. The first metric is: Is it sustainable? Which means, are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations? Is it alternative? Is it different than what is being used today, or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally? And three: Is it renewable? Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources, such as sun, wind and water?"", '01:07': ""Now, my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels. Extreme green. Why aviation? The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined. We need to find an alternative. Also it's a national aeronautics directive. One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels, biofuels, using domestic and safe, friendly resources. Now, combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric — Actually, extreme green for us is all three together; that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that. So it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric. Ninety-seven percent of the world's water is saltwater. How about we use that? Combine that with number three. Do not use arable land. Because crops are already growing on that land that's very scarce around the world. Number two: Don't compete with food crops. That's already a well established entity, they don't need another entry. And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth is fresh water. Don't use fresh water. If 97.5 percent of the world's water is saltwater, 2.5 percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use. But 60 percent of the population lives within that one percent."", '02:40': ""So, combating my problem was, now I have to be extreme green and meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility. This is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes. A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant. Most plants don't like salt, but halophytes tolerate salt. We also are using weeds and we are also using algae. The good thing about our lab is, we've had 3,600 visitors in the last two years. Why do you think that's so? Because we are on to something special."", '03:21': ""So, in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously, and on the right hand side you'll see algae. If you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels, algae is a viable option, there's a lot of funding right now, and we have an algae to fuels program. There's two types of algae growing. One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here, and what you see on the other side is our species — we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus. Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors. Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are: They are quite expensive, they are automated, and it's very difficult to get them in large scale. So on large scale what do they use? We use open pond systems. Now, around the world they are growing algae, with this racetrack design that you see here. Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well, but when it gets around the last turn, which I call turn four — it's stagnant. We actually have a solution for that. In the GreenLab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature: waves. We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems. We have 95 percent mixing and our lipid content is higher than a closed photobioreactor system, which we think is significant."", '04:43': ""There is a drawback to algae, however: It's very expensive. Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively? And the answer is: yes. We do the same thing we do with halophytes, and that is: climatic adaptation. In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater. What we do: We take a potential species, we start at freshwater, we add a little bit more salt, when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as Brazil — right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants — the next tank represents Africa, the next tank represents Arizona, the next tank represents Florida, and the next tank represents California or the open ocean. What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world, where there's barren desert. We are being very successful so far."", '05:42': ""Now, here's one of the problems. If you are a farmer, you need five things to be successful: You need seeds, you need soil, you need water and you need sun, and the last thing that you need is fertilizer. Most people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what? We do not use chemical fertilizer. Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer. Believe it or not, in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems 80 percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves. The 20 percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous. We have a natural solution: fish. No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there. Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies, that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater. Freshwater mollies: cheap, they love to make babies, and they love to go to the bathroom. And the more they go to the bathroom, the more fertilizer we get, the better off we are, believe it or not. It should be noted that we use sand as our soil, regular beach sand. Fossilized coral."", '07:01': 'So a lot of people ask me, ""How did you get started?"" Well, we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab. It\'s a seedling lab. We have 26 different species of halophytes, and five are winners. What we do here is — actually it should be called a death lab, \'cause we try to kill the seedlings, make them rough — and then we come to the GreenLab. What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing, a macro-algae that I\'ll talk about in a minute. And lastly, it\'s me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work, I don\'t just talk about what I do. Here\'s the plant species. Salicornia virginica. It\'s a wonderful plant. I love that plant. Everywhere we go we see it. It\'s all over the place, from Maine all the way to California. We love that plant. Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world. It is the highest lipid content that we have, but it has a shortcoming: It\'s short. Now you take europaea, which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have. And what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology — combine all three to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant. Next, when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay — soybean fields gone — we came up with an idea: Can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware? And the answer is yes. It\'s called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica — say that five times fast if you can. This is a 100 percent usable plant. The seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed. It\'s there for 10 years; it\'s working very well. Now we get to Chaetomorpha. This is a macro-algae that loves excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks. This species is so significant to us. The properties are very close to plastic. We are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic. If we are successful, we will revolutionize the plastics industry.', '09:24': ""So, we have a seed to fuel program. We have to do something with this biomass that we have. And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid optimization, so on and so forth, because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels, aviation specifics, so on and so forth. So far we talked about water and fuel, but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia: It's a food product. So we talk about ideas worth spreading, right? How about this: In sub-Saharan Africa, next to the sea, saltwater, barren desert, how about we take that plant, plant it, half use for food, half use for fuel. We can make that happen, inexpensively. You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany that sells it as a health food product. This is harvested, and in the middle here is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled. So I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans, saltwater asparagus and pickle weed. So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle. Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter) And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense, this is a logical snack. You have mustard, you are a seaman, you see the halophyte, you mix it together, it's a great snack with some crackers. And last, garlic with Salicornia, which is what I like. So, water, fuel and food."", '11:08': 'None of this is possible without the GreenLab team. Just like the Miami Heat has the big three, we have the big three at NASA GRC. That\'s myself, professor Bob Hendricks, our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait. The backbone of the GreenLab is students. Over the last two years we\'ve had 35 different students from around the world working at GreenLab. As a matter fact my division chief says a lot, ""You have a green university."" I say, ""I\'m okay with that, \'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers, which is significant.""', '11:46': ""So, in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food, fuel and water. There's something missing to be complete. Clearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you — We're using clean energy sources here. So, we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab, we have four or five more hopefully coming soon. We are also using something that is quite interesting — there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center, hasn't been used for 15 years. Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues, we realized that they are still viable, so we are refurbishing them right now. In about 30 days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab."", '12:40': ""And the reason why you see red, red and yellow, is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday — This is a picture taken on Saturday. There are no cars around, but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter) This is a proof to you that I'm working. 'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done, most people know that. Here's a concept with this: We are using the GreenLab for a micro-grid test bed for the smart grid concept in Ohio. We have the ability to do that, and I think it's going to work. So, GreenLab Research Facility. A self-sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today. We really, really hope this concept catches on worldwide. We think we have a solution for food, water, fuel and now energy. Complete. It's extreme green, it's sustainable, alternative and renewable and it meets the big three at GRC: Don't use arable land, don't compete with food crops, and most of all, don't use fresh water."", '14:01': 'So I get a lot of questions about, ""What are you doing in that lab?"" And I usually say, ""None of your business, that\'s what I\'m doing in the lab."" (Laughter) And believe it or not, my number one goal for working on this project is I want to help save the world.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how we can end them,"Parasitic worms date back thousands of years, causing diseases that limit human potential. But today, effective treatment against them requires just a few pills, taken once or twice a year. With 1.7 billion people at risk of infection, Ellen Agler and her team at the END Fund are imagining a world without disease caused by worms.

They have influenced the outcomes of wars, and they have long stymied human health. Roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, schistosomiasis: infections from these species cause pain and discomfort. They steal nutrients and zap energy. They stunt both physical and cognitive growth.', '00:41': ""In most cases, these worms may not be fatal, but paradoxically, that's part of the problem. It means that many countries simply have not been able to prioritize their treatment. There's a social cost to that: children without access to deworming treatments have lower rates of school attendance. Adults who grow up without deworming medicine are less productive and have lower lifelong earnings. What intestinal worms do, really, is limit potential."", '01:05': 'Currently, there are 1.7 billion people in the world still at risk for worms. Six hundred million of them are in Africa. For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention, African countries see up to 42 dollars return in economic benefits.', '01:19': ""The good news is that deworming treatment is extremely easy. One to three pills given once or twice a year is enough to take a child from 200 worms to zero and to protect them from infection going forward. In communities where there's a high prevalence of worms, treatment can be done right at school. This process is extremely simple and fast. In Ethiopia, for example, this is done for 20 million children in a matter of weeks."", '01:42': ""The world has come a long way on getting deworming medicines to the people who need them, and African governments want to gain more traction.

They’ll work together to ensure prevention and treatment programs can serve everyone. The END Fund has an audacious idea: they believe we are the generation to end sickness from worm infections forever. The key is not simply to build new programs from scratch, but to amplify the efforts of the programs that are already taking shape. By examining the problem of how worms transmit disease, the END Fund has identified five key areas where they can drive improvement.', '02:24': 'Number one: lower the cost of treatment. Many pharmaceutical companies offer deworming medicines for free, so the END Fund works with the right partners to coordinate their delivery. They will continue to secure drug donations for additional at-risk populations. They can now do it for less than 25 cents per child per year.', '02:43': 'Number two: focus on prevention. The END Fund calls in the right partners to educate communities on sanitation and hygiene in order to change behaviors around things like hand-washing and latrine use, ensuring people are not continually reinfected.', '02:57': 'Number three: invest in innovation. The END Fund has contributed to deworming by introducing innovative techniques that effectively target and treat people. They will test new delivery methods, target the environments where parasites thrive and influence behavior change.', '03:12': 'Number four: monitor and evaluate. The END Fund collects detailed data on all programs on a regular basis to help them get better and better over time.', '03:21': 'Number five: increase local ownership. At all stages of the process, the END Fund works with government and local stakeholders to encourage cofinancing commitments that support deworming efforts. They also worked with African philanthropists and corporate leaders to partner on these efforts.', '03:38': ""There's an incredible opportunity to work together to create a new system for disease elimination for the next decade and beyond. Part of the money the END Fund needs will go directly toward delivering deworming treatments to communities that need it and part will go towards facilitating the handover of programs to local ownership. Together, these efforts will create prevention and treatment programs that are sustainable far into the future. If this plan gets fully funded for the next six years, tens of millions of people will receive deworming treatment. With that, countries will be interrupting the cycle of disease transmission at all levels, and most importantly, people will experience significant improvements in their mental, physical and social health."", '04:21': ""Just imagine the potential that will be gained when people can stop worrying about these and can put their energy into things like these.

https://www.ted.com/talks/mitchell_besser_mothers_helping_mothers_fight_hiv,Mothers helping mothers fight HIV,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV infections are more prevalent and doctors scarcer than anywhere else in the world. With a lack of medical professionals, Mitchell Besser enlisted the help of his patients to create mothers2mothers -- an extraordinary network of HIV-positive women whose support for each other is changing and saving lives.",0:18:15,18.25,279105,2010-09-22T08:54:00+00:00,"['AIDS', 'Africa', 'community', 'health', 'health care', 'women', 'HIV']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Mitchell Besser,HIV/AIDS fighter,"{'00:05': 'I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa, and as you drive along, you look off to the side, and this is what you see: you see a field of graves. And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town, and you inquire, ""What\'s going on here?"" and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says, ""These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."" HIV isn\'t like other medical conditions; it\'s stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it -- there\'s a fear associated with it. And I\'m going to talk about HIV today, about the deaths, about the stigma. It\'s a medical story, but more than that, it\'s a social story.', '00:52': ""This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see, Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are 33 million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these, two-thirds, 22 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa. There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these, 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV-positive mothers. The United States -- a large country -- each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital, outside of Johannesburg in South Africa, and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women giving birth -- a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa, it just pales, because in South Africa, each year 300,000 mothers with HIV give birth to children."", '02:12': ""So we talk about PMTCT, and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive, she's going to infect her child. The reality is really, very different. In resource-rich countries, with all the tests and treatment we currently have, less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive -- 98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative. And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries, in the absence of tests and treatment, 40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected -- 40 percent versus two percent -- an enormous difference. So these programs -- and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk -- these prevention programs, simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies, and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services, and it works."", '03:21': ""So in the United States, since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s, there's been an 80-percent decline in the number of HIV-infected children. Less than 100 babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet, still, over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean? It means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day, infected with HIV. And where do they come from? Well, less than one comes from the United States. One, on average, comes from Europe. 100 come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day, a thousand babies -- a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa."", '04:15': ""So again, I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here, again, we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day, which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?"", '04:58': ""Well, back in 2001, when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug, a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient, would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test, explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine, explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding, and test the baby -- in minutes. Well, fortunately since 2001, we've got new treatments, new tests, and we're far more successful, but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible -- it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care."", '05:45': 'This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care, but we know that just doing a test, just giving someone a drug, it\'s not enough. Meds don\'t equal medical care. Doctors and nurses, frankly, don\'t have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I\'m a doctor -- I tell people things to do, and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I\'m a doctor; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is, if I tell a patient, ""You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom,"" and yet, in her relationship, she\'s not empowered -- what\'s going to happen? If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so it\'s just not going to work. And so we need to do more, we need to do it differently, we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale, which means it can be done everywhere.', '06:48': 'So, I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself, if you can, you\'re a young woman in Africa, you\'re going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you\'re pregnant, and you\'re delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you\'re HIV-positive, and you\'re devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room, and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby, and you hear none of it. All you\'re hearing is, ""I\'m going to die, and my baby is going to die."" And then you\'re out on the street, and you don\'t know where to go. And you don\'t know who you can talk to, because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home, you\'re likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today.', '07:40': 'But we\'re here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test, takes her to a room. The door opens and there\'s a room full of mothers, mothers with babies, and they\'re sitting, and they\'re talking, they\'re listening. They\'re drinking tea, they\'re having sandwiches. And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says, ""Welcome to mothers2mothers. Have a seat. You\'re safe here. We\'re all HIV-positive. You\'re going to be okay. You\'re going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV-negative.""', '08:18': ""We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working, or they're not part of the household. Our organization, mothers2mothers, enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV, who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities, to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers, we call them mentor mothers, are able to engage women who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies, have found out about being HIV-positive, who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines, how to take care of themselves, how to take care of their babies. Consider: if you needed surgery, you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right? But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life, you'd like to engage someone, someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience, and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines."", '09:34': ""So the mothers who work for us, they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts, because their money's protected; the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education, training. Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained. But so often, they only get trained once, so they're not aware of new medicines, new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts. Imagine that: a woman, a former patient, being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of."", '10:25': ""Our organization has three goals. The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission. The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive, keep the children alive -- no more orphans. And the third, and maybe the most grand, is to find ways to empower women, enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it? Well, maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one, seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them, explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that; we try to bring in the husbands, the partners. In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda, in one country, they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her -- that's the rule. And so the father and the mother, together, go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother, together, they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma."", '11:36': ""Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure? Disclosure is so important to treatment, because again, people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing, but what happens is women, they come together -- under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers -- they come together, and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves, how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach, engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think, we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities, we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines, we have the tests, but how do you reduce the stigma? And it's important about disclosure."", '12:43': 'So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back, and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client, because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status, and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings, ""I have something to tell you. I\'m HIV-positive."" And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said, ""I too have something to tell you. I\'m HIV-positive. I\'ve been afraid to tell everybody."" And then this older sister stood up and said, ""I too am living with the virus, and I\'ve been ashamed."" And then her younger brother stood up and said, ""I\'m also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."" And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said, ""I\'m also positive. I thought you were going to hate me."" And there they were, all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time.', '13:47': '(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us, and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story, that I am HIV-positive, but my child is HIV-negative. I tell them, ""You are going to make it, and you will raise a healthy baby."" I am proof that there is hope.', '14:13': ""Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs, we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting. Task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors, and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system? We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs, the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding, family planning, safer sex, actions that nurses simple just don't have time for."", '15:04': ""So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born -- we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby, ensuring that they live healthy, successful lives."", '15:26': ""Our organization works on three levels. The first, at the patient level -- mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV, keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second, communities -- empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems, building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills, don't have the time -- our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in, we can do that."", '16:16': ""I started the program in Capetown, South Africa back in 2001. It was at that point, just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from, I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone. (Laughter) The program is now working in nine countries, we have 670 program sites, we're seeing about 230,000 women every month, we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers, and last year, they enrolled 300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers. That is 20 percent of the global HIV-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma."", '17:17': '(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope, hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV-infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV-positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV-negative babies. All of this is possible, if we each contribute to this fight.', '18:02': ""MB: Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers.

Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million known insect species in the world, but most have one of just five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it just by examining how it eats.', '00:31': 'Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how it evolved and what it feeds on.', '00:57': 'The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order.', '01:29': 'The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers.', '01:55': 'The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like structure called a proboscis that works like a straw to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when they come across some sweet nectar.', '02:19': 'With the sponging mouthpart, there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting members of the Diptera order are the only insects that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart instead of the sponging mouthpart.', '02:55': 'And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps, members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools for pollen-collecting and wax-molding.', '03:18': 'Of course, in nature, there are always exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, for example, have completely different kinds of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts.', '03:36': 'Still, mouthpart identification can, for the most part, help scientists—and you —categorize insects.

I'm talking insomnia, weight gain, hair loss -- the works. I was so overworked that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea. That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity."", '00:22': '[The Way We Work]', '00:26': ""Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day? Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks, trying new frameworks and testing new apps to get even more done? I've tried them all -- task apps, calendar apps, time-management apps, things that are meant to manage your day. We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missed the most important thing. Many of these tools aren't helping. They're making things worse."", '00:51': ""OK, let's talk about productivity for a second. Historically, productivity as we know it today was used during the industrial revolution. It was a system that measured performance based on consistent output. You clocked into your shift and were responsible for creating X number of widgets on the assembly line. At the end of the day, it was pretty easy to see who worked hard and who hadn't. When we shifted to a knowledge economy, people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract, things like writing, problem-solving or strategizing, tasks that weren't easy to measure. Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could, leading to things like the dreaded time sheet where everyone is under pressure to justify how they spend every second of their day."", '01:38': ""There's just one problem. These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work. We still think of productivity as an endurance sport. You try to churn out as many blog posts or we cram our day full of meetings. But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought. Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge. We're expected to be constantly productive and creative in equal measure."", '02:03': ""But it's actually almost impossible for our brains to continuously generate new ideas with no rest. In fact, downtime is a necessity for our brain to recover and to operate properly. Consider that according to a team of researchers from the University of Southern California, letting our minds wander is an essential mental state that helps us develop our identity, process social interactions, and it even influences our internal moral compass. Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling, in other words, the stories that we as a society tell each other about what success looks like and what it takes to get there. Stories like the American Dream, which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs. This tells us that if we work hard, we'll be successful. But there's a flip side. If you aren't successful, it must mean that you're not working hard enough. And if you don't think you're doing enough, of course you're going to stay late, pull all-nighters and push yourself hard even when you know better."", '03:04': ""Productivity has wrapped itself up in our self-worth, so that it's almost impossible for us to allow ourselves to stop working. The average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave, further proving that even if we have the option to take a break, we don't."", '03:21': ""To be clear, I don't think that productivity or trying to improve our performance is bad. I'm just saying that the current models we're using to measure our creative work don't make sense. We need systems that work with our creativity and not against it."", '03:35': '[SO HOW DO WE FIX IT?]', '03:36': ""There is no quick fix for this problem. And I know, I know, that sucks. No one loves a good framework or a good acronym better than me. But the truth is everyone has their own narratives that they have to uncover. It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around work that I began to unravel the root of my own work story, finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors and make positive, long-lasting changes."", '04:01': 'And the only way to do that is by asking yourself some hard questions. Does being busy make you feel valuable? Who do you hold up as an example of success? Where did your ideas of work ethic come from? How much of who you are is linked to what you do?', '04:16': ""Your creativity, it has its own rhythms. Our energy fluctuates daily, weekly, even seasonally. I know that I'm always more energetic at the beginning of the week than at the end, so I front-load my workweek to account for that fact. As a proud night owl, I free up my afternoons and evenings for creative work. And I know I'll get more writing done in the cozy winter months than during the summer."", '04:39': ""And that's the secret. Dismantling myths, challenging your old views, identifying your narratives -- this is the real work that we need to be doing. We aren't machines, and I think it's time that we stopped working like one.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just when they’re about to reach the end of the line, a rope catches them.', '01:13': 'Their savior, Lemma, has been waiting for them. When Ethic claimed the Node of Creation from the forest tower, radios all across the land came back to life. Adila, the resistance leader, immediately started contacting her allies, none more important than Lemma, a brilliant scientist working from within Huxenborg to bring down the machines. Unfortunately, the radios also tipped off the robots. So they’ve taken defensive measures to protect the final artifact in its home in the very heart of the city.', '01:49': 'There’s only one way to get there: the gauntlet of forking paths. It’s a deadly series of luminous conveyors that wind underneath Huxenborg. Starting from the current position, each section runs for a distance, then splits in two.

Only one path leads to the artifact; all the others to destruction.', '02:18': 'Fortunately, the Node of Creation has granted Hedge a strange power: he can produce slightly smaller versions of himself. Each version can do only two things: radio information back to its parent, and produce slightly smaller versions of itself… which can do the same two things, as can their children, for as many generations as needed.

Where a loop takes one action and repeats it again and again, recursion will start an action, and before it’s finished, use it again, and before that’s finished, use it again, and so on. It keeps doing this until some end state is reached. It then passes the information back up, layer after layer, until it reaches the top and ends the cycle.', '03:50': 'Recursion is ideal for problems that involve self-similarity, where each part resembles the larger whole.

If Hedge copies himself, the copy that goes the wrong way will be destroyed. So the other one, which will reach the artifact, can radio back the path it took, and then no matter which way is correct, that’s the answer Hedge will receive. This is called the ""base case"" of the recursion.', '04:44': 'Now, suppose the maze branches twice from the starting point, and at every intersection, Hedge’s copies— let’s call them Twig 1 and Twig 2— make more copies— let’s call them Leaves 1 through 4. Three Leaves will be destroyed. The one that reaches the artifact will radio back the right answer, but only to its parent. So if Twig 1 or 2 is waiting at an intersection and hears something over the radio, that’s the right way to go to the artifact from where it is. To tell Hedge the right answer from his perspective, the Twig should say which way it went, and then the route it just heard over the radio.', '05:26': 'This same process will work no matter how many times the maze branches. Any answer a copy hears on the radio must be the way to the control room from its location, and if it then adds the branch it took, it can tell its parent how to get there as well.', '05:43': 'We can sum up the instructions in an action called Pathfinder that every version of Hedge will follow:', '05:50': '1. If you’ve reached the artifact, radio to your parent whether you got there by going left or right.', '05:56': '2.

If you hear anything over the radio, you should radio to your parent whether you got to your spot by going left or right, then repeat everything you just heard.', '06:25': 'Pathfinder is an example of what programmers call functions, subroutines, or procedures. No matter the terminology, the idea is the same— it’s a set of instructions given a label so that it can be easily reused— perhaps even by itself.', '06:42': 'And in our case that’ll work perfectly— an entire network of paths mapped using just three instructions.', '06:52': ""So here's what happens."", '07:15': 'By the time the patrol rounds the corner, Ethic and Lemma have improvised disguises.

Because it\'s scary and it\'s expensive, but we need to have it, OK? So, these are the problems. There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there? I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems. These are a few of them. So, what did I do?', '05:58': ""There we go -- we're going on a mission. We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit, on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons, cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse. We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far. Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place, but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier? Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission. Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling. You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first."", '06:43': 'So, here we are, mission. Big trouble. Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble. That\'s Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi. Does he look like he\'s happy? It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey, you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy? Yes, that\'s the medical advice the committee chairman says, ""Yes, I told you, you weren\'t going to be able to, you can\'t do this, I just know it."" Look, that\'s the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?', '07:15': '(Laughter)', '07:16': ""I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K. Yes, let's just go work this thing out. See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally. We get a lot of donated equipment. Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that, so long as we use it and we move on."", '07:40': ""But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there. He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone. So what we going to do now? It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that. We eventually got it working, is the truth, but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw."", '08:03': ""The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray, it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays. Do you figure where that is? It was on a window. I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please. Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them, you email them. But we were still using X-rays, but we didn't even have a viewing box! And we were doing open-heart surgery."", '08:33': ""OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria, but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease, VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies. You still get people who believe in it and they came. At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97. Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required, would have been treated when she was a child. We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do. We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right."", '09:33': 'But how many did we do the first one? 12. We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully. Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care, and just watch that chair, all right? This is what I mean about appropriate technology. That\'s what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn\'t work. Have you seen one of those before? No? Yes? Doesn\'t matter, it worked. I\'m sure you\'ve all seen or heard this before: ""We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --', '10:10': '(Applause) -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.""', '10:15': '(Applause)', '10:18': 'Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company. This one\'s sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, ""Guys, let\'s just buy stuff. Let\'s go set up a company that teaches people, educates them, gives them the tools they need to keep going.""', '10:39': ""And that's a perfect example of one. Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything, and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do, because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced, does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine: multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction. This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone? That's exactly how the outlets are designed. Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there. And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case. And guess what, if it all fails, if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it. Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want? Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables."", '11:52': ""And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site. The technology for oxygen delivery is not new. Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new, and what we will have in a few months, I hope, is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air. If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much. So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it."", '12:43': ""These are the basic features of my device, or our device. This is what makes it so special. Apart from the awards it's won, it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA -- and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise, size-wise, ease of use, complexity ..."", '13:11': ""This picture was taken last year. These are members of my graduating class, 1986. It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac, for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got. African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it, in conjunction with everyone else."", '14:04': 'Thank you.', '14:06': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's an African story. It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour."", '00:16': ""There was Hollywood. Then came Bollywood. Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world. In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria. Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa. Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars. It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs. And it's expanding. But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement. This is something that happened without foreign investment, without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds, in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy. The industry is 15 years old."", '01:33': ""And so maybe you're thinking now, why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story? And so I think I have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life, because I think there is a connection. My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia. My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa. And I was born in Zambia. Even though I left when I was only three years old, I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life. And it really was a place where I learned to walk. I think I uttered the first words, and my family bought their first home. So when we came back to Italy, and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories. It seemed that for our neighbors and friends, Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination, or the place of horror, famine. And so we were always caught in this stereotype. And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives, and have dreams like we all have. So when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood, I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions."", '03:28': 'Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do, and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me. I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University. And we really look how digital technology is changing, and how young, independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost. So when I proposed the story, I really had all the support to make this film. And not only had the support, I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure. Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer, and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor, who is a veteran of National Geographic, and told me, ""You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don\'t know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun.""', '04:29': 'So we went to Lagos in October 2005. And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa, a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight. The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood, of this incredible film industry, following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption, called ""Checkpoint."" Police corruption. And he had nine days to make it. We thought this was a good story.', '05:06': ""In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood, and we talked to a lot of filmmakers. But I don't want to create too many expectations. I would like to show you six minutes. And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience. There are several themes from the documentary, but they are re-edited and made for you, OK? So I guess it's a world premier."", '05:29': '(Video) Man: Action. Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here. And you shoot in seven days. Peace Piberesima: We\'re doing films for the masses. We\'re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses. They can afford to watch their ""Robocop"" and whatever. Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it, is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living. It\'s not the fancy filmmaking where you say, oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood, and where you have big budgets.', '06:19': ""Here is that you make these films, it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film, because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed. Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate."", '06:39': ""I believe in the power of audiovisuals. I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood. I think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is, put in a message in there. Woman: You still have to report the incident. He needs proper medical attention. PP: I keep trying to explain to people, it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming. I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films."", '07:27': ""Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa. Lancelot Imasen: But our films, they are stories that our people can relate to themselves. They are stories about our people, for our people. And consistently, they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story. Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue. It's the blockbuster comedy. You'll crack your ribs."", '08:18': ""Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies. It's all about the foreign movies. But we can do something too. We can do something, something that when the world sees it, they say, wow, this is Nigeria. Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant. Don't embarrass yourself. Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back."", '08:48': 'SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model. It’s not just what you see in picture. You see the person live. You see how he talks. You see how he lives. He influences you really good, you know. It’s not just what you see in the picture. It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press. Man: See you. Bye. Action.', '09:13': ""Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies. But then when I discovered the situation in my country, at that time there was so much corruption. For a young man to really make it out here, you got to think of some negative things and all that, or some kind of vices. And I didn't want that, you know. And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor, without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies. Just me and God-given talent. Man: Let's go. OK, it's time to kick some ass. Cover this. It's your own. Move it."", '10:13': ""Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies, they have all these things in place. But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots. Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there, but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out. Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face. Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape. The masking tape will hold it. Wat, wait. Just hold this for me. KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know. But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing. I'm trying to protect my face too. This ain't going to be my last movie. You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives."", '10:59': ""RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here, with or without any assistance from anybody. Man: Action. Cut. (Applause)"", '11:19': ""Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time. So many themes in this story. I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you. I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers, and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm, that is incredible."", '11:44': 'Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said, ""I need to make movies like you need oxygen."" And I think they’re breathing. The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like. And so it\'s a very, very important thing for them, and for their audiences. A woman told me, ""When I see a Nollywood film, I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better.""', '12:09': ""There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience. It’s technology. I’m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars. And this has unleashed tremendous energy. And guess what? We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers. They understood it, they embraced the technology and they run with it, and they’re successful. I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways. I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology, look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs, create a narrative for the population, something to identify, something positive, something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture. But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us. I really think it goes both ways."", '13:10': 'Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say, ""Wow, they are doing what we really want to do, and make a buck and live with this job."" So I really think it’s a lesson that we\'re actually learning from them. And there\'s one thing, one small challenge that I have for you, and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling. And I think this is really the theme of this session. Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories. No stories around the campfire. No legends, no fairytales. Nothing. No novels. Difficult, eh? It\'s meaningless.', '13:57': 'So this is what I really think. I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers, and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. I would like you to hear their voices. Just a few moments. It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.', '14:24': ""(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them. If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face, that’s Nollywood. SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies, we'll have that original Nigerian movie. BE: It’s still the same basic themes. Love, action. But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way. We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many, that in the natal lifetimes, I don't see us exhausting the stories we have."", '15:02': 'FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations, where we teach each other things. And I really hope that this will happen. Thank you very much. (Applause)', '15:24': ""Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions. Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry. What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?"", '15:36': ""FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films. There is scientific data on this."", '15:42': 'CA: 2,000 films a year? FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6, the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone. And we know that there are more. So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films. So imagine 45 films per week. There are challenges. There are challenges. There is a glut of film, the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level, but I’m optimistic.', '16:08': 'CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?', '16:11': 'FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important. Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this, these are films that are distributed directly in markets. They are bought in video shops. They can be rented for pennies.', '16:26': 'CA: On what format?', '16:27': ""FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs. It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image. They started with VHS. They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology. They started in '92, '94. So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs. It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc."", '16:52': 'CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?', '16:54': ""FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes. (Laughter) And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling, it's a commodity, it's a staple. There is no life without stories."", '17:13': 'CA: Franco, thank you so much.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the Afro pick was designed for the ergonomics of creating something that felt like you were running fingers through your hair. The shape, even the depth that it goes in -- it's like a hand. You have plastic or nylon teeth, and then you have the stainless steel or the nickel teeth. I always prefer the metal tooth just 'cause I like the sound and the ones I know have the black power fist on the handle."", '00:50': ""When I think of black hair in America, I think of something that's been policed. Back in the days, it was expected for black people to chemically treat their hair. Whether that's healthy for them is a secondary thing to blending in."", '01:04': 'In the 50s, dancer Ruth Beckford and a lot of jazz singers were tired of straightening their hair, so they said, all right, we\'re going to just let it grow naturally and started rocking natural, close-cropped hair. And in the 60s, that style evolved with the formation of the Afro, which was the cropped hair, natural, picked out into a more spherical shape. You had civil rights leaders, activists, that adopted the hairstyle as a means of rebellion and black pride. And then you had musicians like James Brown, who was infamously known for chemically straightening his hair, reject that and go natural. It went hand-in-hand with his music, so he had songs like ""Say it Loud, I\'m Black and I\'m Proud.""', '01:45': ""The black is beautiful movement is just rejecting the notion that to be black or to have darker skin, to have a curlier grade of hair, was something to be ashamed of. I have one of my favorite pictures of my mother and my grandmother, and my grandmother had a small 'fro, and that was in the 60s."", '02:03': ""African hair combs date back to 3500 BCE. The oldest African combs are found in ancient Egypt and Sudan, so they were making pyramids and combs. The way the ancient African combs were embellished represented status or tribal affiliation. It's no coincidence that the fist on the modern Afro pick also sets the tone for affiliation and what set you claim."", '02:31': ""And then there's the Black Power movement. Most movements need their icons, right? You have the fist, you have the 'fro. These things coincide with the Black Panther aesthetic, where you could kind of spot your tribe from afar, because you're not just keeping a pick in, like, your beauty kit. It's in your back pocket, purposely with the first outside of it, and in your hair, you'll rock it in your 'fro."", '02:52': ""If I think about iconic Afros, I definitely think about Angela Davis. Her 'fro personifies elegance, style, freedom, rebellion. You feel all of these feelings at once when you see Angela Davis fighting for her life in federal court."", '03:06': ""By the 80s, the Afro style became less radical. The Afro picks are still produced to this day with the clenched fist, so it's the remnants of the movement in the everyday object."", '03:18': 'When I was young, it was just, like, another object.

It was a cube -- a very well large cube, at that. Each side had a window in order for the spectators to view the interior of the structure. The exterior of the structure was a collage of Africa and Africans as portrayed in the Western media and literature. A look through the windows revealed a sharp contrast: within the cubes are tranquil, civilized, domestic images of African family members, friends and Nigerian professionals, ranging from writers, poets, fashion designers, etc. The thing is, both the exterior and the interior images are quite true. But the images captured by Western media overwhelmingly depict Africans as basically primitive at best, or barely distinguishable from the African animals. Not much has changed, I\'m afraid, since 1996, when I executed this work.', '01:48': 'I began my professional photography practice in 1994, but my passion and enthusiasm for photography goes back to childhood, when my parents arranged for us to be photographed by a professional photographer on almost a monthly basis. It was also an opportunity for my siblings to dress up in our latest gear, made by our tailor. Later, when I was in boarding school, my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras, and then I began to experiment with self-portraiture, or what I would call ""proto-selfie auto-portraits.""', '02:41': '(Laughter)', '02:43': '""Cover Girl 1994"" was my first major work that was critically well received in the US and Europe and quite instantly became a part of the school anthologies at universities and colleges. With the ""Cover Girl"" series, I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover with imagery totally unexpected, yet profoundly reasonable. The ""Cover Girl"" series proposed a different way the African can be represented in a more complex manner.', '03:25': 'Like ""Cover Girl,"" the ""Sartorial Anarchy"" series is made up of self-portraits. It is an ongoing body of work, started in 2010. In each image, I married disparate costumes from widely diverse traditions, countries and time frames. And in mixing eras, cultures, I was able to bring harmony, as it were, to their similarly irreconcilable differences. These differences became a source of inspired artistic celebration.', '04:16': 'For example, in ""Sartorial Anarchy #4,"" I mixed a boater hat, inspired by the traditional Eton-Oxford College Boat Race, with a green Afghan traditional coat and an American Boy Scout shirt -- a culture clash that works. In ""Sartorial Anarchy #5,"" I wore a macaroni wig, inspired by eighteenth-century macaroni headgear from England.

Nollywood is the first time that you have a school of African filmmakers truly, truly, profoundly in charge of telling African stories. In their varied movies -- from romantic movies, horror films, gangster movies to action movies -- one sees Nigerians portrayed with many layers of complexities. All the Nigerian, or ""Naija,"" archetypes, if you allow, are there -- from the divvers, the ""Shakara,"" the coquette, the gangsters, the rich, the corrupt politicians, the whore, the pimp -- all in their swagger.

Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me to indulge my passion for color, dressed in a long, fitted blue dress that emphasizes her curves, seated on an upholstered green velvet bench.

It is at the Vatican. This grand group portrait is the exact same size as Rafael\'s ""School of Athens."" It measures roughly 27 feet in width by six and a half feet in height.', '11:32': 'Nollywood also exemplifies a type of modernity never before seen in Africa. Think of it: there has never been anything so ubiquitous with such iconic optics to come out of Africa since the Nile Valley civilizations of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia. Outside of Nollywood, the image of Africa remains frozen in the old ""National Geographic"" mode and safari perspective. But as Africans continue to step and see themselves portrayed by Nollywood in their varied and fantastic complexities, they will, in turn, propagate and perpetuate the positive image of themselves. This is what Hollywood did and continues to do for the West.', '12:33': 'As shocking as this may be, it is almost a taboo in the art world to show Africans in a modern framework -- that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned, manicured, pedicured and coiffed.', '12:52': '(Applause)', '12:57': 'Part of my job is to keep beautifying Africa for the world, one portrait at a time.', '13:05': 'Thank you.', '13:07': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth built by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a physical maze but a novel.

And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another set of divergent futures.', '03:27': 'Borges laid out infinite expanses of time in his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of condensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men might receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious old priest who spends years memorizing and deciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he finally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing about his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of everyone who has ever existed.

Today's computers can beat us in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that mimic our biological neurons by forming connections and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify those samples by adjusting the relative weights assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion, and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence structure in our writing. You might think that training neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much data is out there, and how quickly modern computers can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify the people likely to commit crimes before they even make a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances, like irony, and scales of emotions, just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed that the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors that varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins was one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated facial expressions— were universal.', '00:53': 'In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman set about testing this theory by examining hundreds of hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated from the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ expressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely the situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who had no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos of different facial expressions with stories designed to trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has corroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional expressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate to a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures.', '01:41': 'For instance, researchers have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that if expressions are universal, they would be displayed in the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion when winning or losing their matches.', '02:01': 'Further evidence can be found in our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression between humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure and movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter looks different from ours, but uses some of the same muscle movements.', '02:18': 'Back in the 60s, Ekman identified six core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered eyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up and the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows and relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling around the eyes. More recently, researchers have proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary on how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn.', '03:15': 'So if Ekman and other researchers are correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed in these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted in our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions are important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal to others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention to faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already on high alert.', '03:46': 'Expressions also could help improve group fitness by communicating our internal states to those around us. Sadness, for example, signals to the group that something’s wrong. There’s some evidence that expressions might be even more directly linked to our physiology. The fear expression, for instance, could directly improve survival in potentially dangerous situations by letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air, preparing us to fight or flee.', '04:15': 'There’s still much research to be done in understanding emotional expression, particularly as we learn more about the inner workings of the brain. But if you ever find yourself among strangers in a strange land, a friendly smile could go a long way.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, the floating stacks of stones nearby are bridge components— invented by Octavia herself— called hover-blocks. Activate a pile with a burst of energy, and they’ll self-assemble to span the ravine as Ethic walks across. But there is, of course, a catch. The hover-blocks are only stable when they’re perfectly palindromic. Meaning they have to form a sequence that’s the same when viewed forwards and backwards.', '01:22': 'The stacks start in random orders, but will always put themselves into a palindromic configuration if they can. If they get to a point where a palindrome isn’t possible, the bridge will collapse, and whoever’s on it will fall into the ravine.', '01:37': 'Let’s look at an example. This stack would make itself stable. First the A blocks hold themselves in place. Then the B’s. And finally the C would nestle right between the B’s. However, suppose there was one more A.

That’s because the total time is a function of the factorial of the number of blocks there are. 10 blocks have over 3 million combinations.', '03:29': 'What this naïve solution shows is that we need a much faster way to tell whether a pile of blocks can form a palindrome. To start, it may be intuitively clear that a pile of all different blocks will never form one. Why? The first and last blocks can’t be the same if there are no repeats. So when can a given sequence become a palindrome?', '03:54': 'One way to figure that out is to analyze a few existing palindromes. In ANNA, there are 2 A’s and 2 N’s. RACECAR has 2 R’s, 2 A’s, 2 C’s, and 1 E. And MADAM IM ADAM has 4 M’s, 4 A’s, 2 D’s, and 1 I.', '04:13': 'The pattern here is that most of the letters occur an even number of times, and there’s at most 1 that occurs just once. Is that it? What if RACECAR had 3 E’s instead of 1? We could tack the new E’s onto the ends and still get a palindrome, so 3 is ok. But make that 3 E’s and 3 C’s, and there’s nowhere for the last C to go. So the most generalized insight is that at most one letter can appear an odd number of times, but the rest have to be even.', '04:47': 'Hedge can count the letters in each stack and organize them into a dictionary, which is a tidy way of storing information. A loop could then go through and count how many times odd numbers appear. If there are less than 2 odd characters, the stack can be made into a palindrome.', '05:04': 'This approach is much, much faster than the naïve solution. Instead of factorial time, it takes linear time. That’s where the time increases in proportion to the number of blocks there are.', '05:16': 'Now write a loop for Hedge to approach the piles individually, and stop when he finds a good one, and you’ll be ready to go.', '05:24': 'Here’s what happens:', '05:25': 'Hedge is fast, but there are so many piles it takes a long time.

The Celts were never one unified empire, and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought their enemies.', '01:37': 'Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies.', '02:21': 'But the Celts were much more than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen, artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments of warrior kings— and composed biting satires about cowardly or selfish leaders.', '02:42': 'The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid, or question their decisions.', '03:24': 'In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite against their common enemy under the leadership of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France.', '04:13': 'Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle against the enemy.', '04:38': 'By the end of the 1st century CE, Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some people call this ""citizen journalism,"" other people call it ""collaborative journalism."" But really, it kind of means this: for the journalists, people like me, it means accepting that you can\'t know everything, and allowing other people, through technology, to be your eyes and your ears. And for people like you, for other members of the public, it can mean not just being the passive consumers of news, but also coproducing news. And I believe this can be a really empowering process. It can enable ordinary people to hold powerful organizations to account.', '00:46': ""So I'm going to explain this to you today with two cases, two stories that I've investigated. And they both involve controversial deaths. And in both cases, the authorities put out an official version of events, which was somewhat misleading. We were able to tell an alternative truth utilizing new technology, utilizing social media, particularly Twitter. Essentially, what I'm talking about here is, as I said, citizen journalism."", '01:14': ""So, to take the first case: this is Ian Tomlinson, the man in the foreground. He was a newspaper vendor from London, and on the 1st of April 2009, he died at the G20 protests in London. Now, he had been -- he wasn't a protester, he'd been trying to find his way home from work through the demonstrations. But he didn't get home. He had an encounter with a man behind him, and as you can see, the man behind him has covered his face with a balaclava. And, in fact, he wasn't showing his badge numbers. But I can tell you now, he was PC Simon Harwood, a police officer with London's Metropolitan Police Force. In fact, he belonged to the elite territorial support group. Now, moments after this image was shot, Harwood struck Tomlinson with a baton, and he pushed him to ground, and Tomlinson died moments later."", '02:07': ""But that wasn't the story the police wanted us to tell. Initially, through official statements and off-the-record briefings, they said that Ian Tomlinson had died of natural causes. They said that there had been no contact with the police, that there were no marks on his body. In fact, they said that when police tried to resuscitate him, the police medics were impeded from doing so, because protesters were throwing missiles, believed to be bottles, at police. And the result of that were stories like this. I show you this slide, because this was the newspaper that Ian Tomlinson had been selling for 20 years of his life. And if any news organization had an obligation to properly forensically analyze what had been going on, it was the Evening Standard newspaper. But they, like everyone else -- including my news organization -- were misled by the official version of events put out by police. But you can see here, the bottles that were supposedly being thrown at police were turned into bricks by the time they reached this edition of the newspaper. So we were suspicious, and we wanted to see if there was more to the story. We needed to find those protesters you see in the image, but, of course, they had vanished by the time we started investigating. So how do you find the witnesses? This is, for me, where it got really interesting. We turned to the internet."", '03:24': ""This is Twitter; you've heard a lot about it today. Essentially, for me, when I began investigating this case, I was completely new to this; I'd signed up two days earlier. I discovered that Twitter was a microblogging site. It enabled me to send out short, 140-character messages. Also, an amazing search facility. But it was a social arena in which other people were gathering with a common motive. And in this case, independently of journalists, people themselves were interrogating exactly what had happened to Ian Tomlinson in his last 30 minutes of life. Individuals like these two guys. They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid after he collapsed. They phoned the ambulance. They didn't see any bottles, they didn't see any bricks. So they were concerned that the stories weren't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be. And again, through social media, we started encountering individuals with material like this: photographs, evidence. Now, this does not show the attack on Ian Tomlinson, but he appears to be in some distress. Was he drunk? Did he fall over? Did this have anything to do with the police officers next to him? Here he appears to be talking to them. For us, this was enough to investigate further, to dig deeper. The result was putting out stories ourselves."", '04:49': ""One of the most amazing things about the internet is: the information that people put out is freely available to anyone, as we all know. That doesn't just go for citizen journalists, or for people putting out messages on Facebook or Twitter. That goes for journalists themselves, people like me. As long as your news is the right side of a paywall, i.e, it's free, anybody can access it. And stories like these, which were questioning the official version of events, which were skeptical in tone, allowed people to realize that we had questions ourselves. They were online magnets. Individuals with material that could help us were drawn toward us by some kind of gravitational force. And after six days, we had managed to track down around 20 witnesses. We've plotted them here on the map."", '05:35': ""This is the scene of Ian Tomlinson's death, the Bank of England in London. And each of these witnesses that we plotted on the map, you could click on these small bullet points, and you could hear what they had to say, see their photographic image and at times, see their videographic images as well. But still, at this stage, with witnesses telling us that they'd seen police attack Ian Tomlinson before his death, still, police refused to accept that. There was no official investigation into his death."", '06:06': ""And then something changed. I got an email from an investment fund manager in New York. On the day of Ian Tomlinson's death, he'd been in London on business, and he'd taken out his digital camera, and he'd recorded this."", '06:26': '(Video) Narrator: This is the crowd at G20 protest on April the 1st, around 7:20pm. They were on Cornhill, near the Bank of England. This footage will form the basis of a police investigation into the death of this man. Ian Tomlinson was walking through this area, attempting to get home from work.', '06:44': '(People yelling)', '06:59': ""We've slowed down the footage to show how it poses serious questions about police conduct. Ian Tomlinson had his back to riot officers and dog handlers and was walking away from them. He had his hands in his pockets. Here the riot officer appears to strike Tomlinson's leg area with a baton. He then lunges at Tomlinson from behind. Tomlinson is propelled forward and hits the floor."", '07:27': '(People yelling)', '07:37': 'Paul Lewis: OK. So, shocking stuff. That video wasn\'t playing too well, but I remember when I first watched the video for myself, I\'d been in touch with this investment fund manager in New York, and I had become obsessed with this story. I had spoken to so many people who said they had seen this happen, and the guy on the other end of the phone was saying, ""Look, the video shows it."" I didn\'t want to believe him until I saw it for myself. It was two o\'clock in the morning, I was there with an IT guy -- the video wasn\'t coming. Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it. And I realized: this is really something quite significant. Within 15 hours, we put it on our website. The first thing police did was they came to our office -- senior officers came to our office -- and asked us to take the video down. We said no. It would have been too late, anyway, because it had traveled around the world. And the officer in that film, in two days\' time, will appear before an inquest jury in London, and they have the power to decide that Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.', '08:31': ""So that's the first case; I said two cases today. The second case is this man. Now, like Ian Tomlinson, he was a father, he lived in London. But he was a political refugee from Angola. And six months ago, the British government decided they wanted to return him to Angola; he was a failed asylum seeker. So they booked him a seat on an airline, a flight from Heathrow. Now, the official version of events, the official explanation, of Jimmy Mubenga's death was simply that he'd taken ill. He'd become unwell on the flight, the plane had returned to Heathrow, and then he was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead."", '09:08': 'Now, what actually happened to Jimmy Mubenga, the story we were able to tell, my colleague Mathew Taylor and I, was that, actually, three security guards began trying to restrain him in his seat; when was resisting his deportation, they were restraining him in his seat. They placed him in a dangerous hold. It keeps detainees quiet, and he was making a lot of noise. But it can also lead to positional asphyxia, a form of suffocation. So you have to imagine: there were other passengers on the plane, and they could hear him saying, ""I can\'t breathe! I can\'t breathe! They\'re killing me!"" And then he stopped breathing. So how did we find these passengers? In the case of Ian Tomlinson, the witnesses were still in London. But these passengers, many of them, had returned to Angola. How were we going to find them?', '09:50': 'Again, we turned to the internet. We wrote, as I said before, stories -- they\'re online magnets. The tone of some these stories, journalism professors might frown upon because they were skeptical; they were asking questions, perhaps speculative, maybe the kind of things journalists shouldn\'t do. But we needed to do it, and we needed to use Twitter also. Here I\'m saying an Angolan man dies on a flight. This story could be big; a level of speculation. This next tweet says, ""Please RT."" That means ""please retweet,"" please pass down the chain. And one of the fascinating things about Twitter is that the pattern of flow of information is unlike anything we\'ve ever seen before. We don\'t really understand it, but once you let go of a piece of information, it travels like wind. You can\'t determine where it ends up. But strangely, tweets have an uncanny ability to reach their intended destination. And in this case, it was this man. He says, ""I was also there on the BA77"" -- that\'s the flight number -- ""And the man was begging for help, and I now feel so guilty that I did nothing.""', '10:52': ""This was Michael. He was on an Angolan oil field when he sent me this tweet. I was in my office in London. He had concerns about what happened on the flight. He'd gone onto his laptop, he typed in the flight number. He had encountered that tweet, he had encountered our stories. He realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events; we were skeptical. And he contacted me. And this is what Michael said."", '11:21': '(Audio) Michael: I\'m pretty sure it\'ll turn out to be asphyxiation. The last thing we heard the man saying was he couldn\'t breathe. And you\'ve got three security guards, each one of them looked like 100-kilo plus, bearing down on him, holding him down -- from what I could see, below the seats. What I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats. And all I could see was his head sticking up above the seats, and he was hollering out, you know, ""Help me!"" He just kept saying, ""Help me! Help me!"" And then he disappeared below the seats. And you could see the three security guards sitting on top of him from there. For the rest of my life, I\'m always going to have that in the back of my mind. Could I have done something? That\'s going to bother me every time I lay down to go to sleep now. Wow; I didn\'t get involved because I was scared I might get kicked off the flight and lose my job. If it takes three men to hold a man down, to put him on a flight, one the public is on, that\'s excessive. OK? If the man died, that right there is excessive.', '12:42': ""PL: So that was his interpretation of what had happened on the flight. And Michael was actually one of five witnesses that we eventually managed to track down, most of them, as I said, through the internet, through social media. We could actually place them on the plane, so you could see exactly where they were sat. And I should say at this stage that one really important dimension to all of this for journalists who utilize social media and who utilize citizen journalism is making sure we get our facts correct. Verification is absolutely essential. So in the case of the Ian Tomlinson witnesses, I got them to return to the scene of the death and physically walk me through and tell me exactly what they had seen. That was absolutely essential. In the case of Mubenga, we couldn't do that, but they could send us their boarding passes. And we could interrogate what they were saying and ensure it was consistent with what other passengers were saying, too. The danger in all of this for journalists -- for all of us -- is that we're victims of hoaxes, or that there's deliberate misinformation fed into the public domain. So we have to be careful."", '13:46': ""But nobody can deny the power of citizen journalism. When a plane crashes into the Hudson two years ago, and the world finds out about this because a man is on a nearby ferry, and he takes out his iPhone and photographs the image of the plane and sends it around the world -- that's how most people found out initially, in the early minutes and hours, about the plane in the Hudson River."", '14:09': ""Now, think of the two biggest news stories of the year. We had the Japanese earthquake and the tsunami. Cast your mind's eye back to the images that you saw on your television screens. They were boats left five miles inland. They were houses being moved along, as if in the sea. Water lifting up inside people's living rooms, supermarkets shaking -- these were images shot by citizen journalists and instantly shared on the internet."", '14:38': ""And the other big story of the year: the political crisis, the political earthquake in the Middle East. And it doesn't matter if it was Egypt or Libya or Syria or Yemen. Individuals have managed to overcome the repressive restrictions in those regimes by recording their environment and telling their own stories on the internet. Again, always very difficult to verify, but potentially, a huge layer of accountability. This image -- and I could have shown you any, actually; YouTube is full of them -- This image is of an apparently unarmed protester in Bahrain. And he's being shot by security forces. It doesn't matter if the individual being mistreated, possibly even killed, is in Bahrain or in London. But citizen journalism and this technology has inserted a new layer of accountability into our world, and I think that's a good thing."", '15:36': 'So to conclude: the theme of the conference, ""Why not?"" -- I think for journalists, it\'s quite simple, really. I mean, why not utilize this technology, which massively broadens the boundaries of what\'s possible, accept that many of the things that happen in our world now go recorded, and we can obtain that information through social media? That\'s new for journalists.', '15:58': 'The stories I showed you, I don\'t think we would have been able to investigate 10 years ago, possibly even five years ago. I think there\'s a very good argument to say that the two deaths, the death of Ian Tomlinson and the death of Jimmy Mubenga, we still today wouldn\'t know exactly what had happened in those cases. And ""Why not?"" for people like yourselves? Well, I think that\'s very simple, too. If you encounter something that you believe is problematic, that disturbs you, that concerns you, an injustice of some kind, something that just doesn\'t feel quite right, then why not witness it, record it and share it? That process of witnessing, recording and sharing is journalism.', '16:42': 'And we can all do it. Thank you.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes. And he was here, as you well know, in \'35. And you\'d think he was chasing finches, but he wasn\'t. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them as very ""common."" This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it until the \'80s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places, so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is, we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here?', '01:19': ""The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline. (Laughter) Because I was there in '71, studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn, and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn."", '01:45': 'And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees, as you can see, and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. When I went there 27 years later, the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.', '02:30': ""My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s -- Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat, quite ugly, is called the Mutiara 4. And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught, we didn't have words for it. What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea. And 90 percent of our catch were sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debris, the piles of debris, were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down."", '03:35': ""And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented."", '04:18': ""We transform the world, but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this, something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply. And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then, they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were."", '05:26': ""Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline."", '06:17': 'And the question is, why do people accept this? Well because they don\'t know that it was different. And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it\'s not ""scientific."" So you have a situation where people don\'t know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don\'t trust the sources of the past.', '07:15': 'And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline.', '07:50': 'How about the people who can\'t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example? There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like ""Avatar."" (Laughter) And if you think about ""Avatar,"" if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery? Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation, it\'s the only one I will provide, is for Cameron to do ""Avatar II"" underwater.', '08:46': 'Thank you very much.', '08:48': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motion pictures have been in existence for more than a hundred years. Filmmaking hasn\'t changed for the dimensional mindset. Placing the camera in a scene and pressing ""record"" hasn\'t changed. Filmmaking is still a frontal experience, and creating the film has the possibility to follow the same direction of the content creation. We still stand in front of a flat image, watching the fiction.', '00:40': ""There's nothing wrong with it. I love watching movies and going to the theaters. The experiences can be such emotional experiences. The art and craft of emotional experiences within a frame can be so strong to drive a stronger emotion. The question we're asking is, How the experience of motion pictures can exist beyond the flat screen. How can we start creating content for the next generation of content experiences?"", '01:08': ""Traditionally, when we imagine a scene, we look at the frame and the composition. We have to think about how we create depth and parallax using foreground, background elements as the camera moves. With the technology today and devices of VR glasses, AR glasses, smart devices, allowing three-dimensional and full navigation in space, we have the possibility to enable audiences to experience content from multiple perspectives. What we have to think about is how we take this technology, all the capabilities, and enable the experience to move farther away inside the scene. Now we're not talking about video games or computer-generated actors, which look tremendously realistic. We're talking about real actors and real performance, performing onstage. We have to start thinking how we capture the actors and how we capture the real scene in order to immerse inside."", '02:10': ""Now, we're familiar with the 360-degree video, where you place a camera inside the scene and you can create this beautiful panoramic image all around you, but from the same aspect, filmmaking is still frontal. In order to emerge fully inside the scene, we will need to capture the light from all the possible directions. We will have to surround the scene with an enormous amount of sensors, with all possible capabilities to capture the light and enable us to emerge inside afterwards again."", '02:44': 'Now, in this setup, there\'s no more foreground or background or a camera placed in space but hundreds of sensors capturing the light and capturing the motion from all the possible directions. With the new technological advancements, we can start looking at 3D photography, capturing the light from multiple perspectives, enabling us to reconstruct the object. This is like photography in 3D space. Now, with these technological advancements, we can record video not just as a flat image but as a volume. This is what we call ""volumetric video,"" and it has the capability to record every action of the scene as a full three-dimensional volume.', '03:27': ""Now, what is a voxel? A voxel is like a three-dimensional pixel, but instead of being a flat image square, staying light and colored, it's like a three-dimensional cube in space, with x, y, and z positions. This enables us to create a full capture of the scene from any perspective. Now this renders a fully light-immersive scene from multiple perspectives. This capability requires an insane amount of information to be processed. We will have to capture the light from an enormous amount of cameras to create this information."", '04:11': 'Now, in order to do such a thing, we would need a setup that would host a numerous amount of cameras installed in a stage and a stage big enough in order to fit a full cinematic experience.', '04:28': ""Now that sounds like a crazy idea, but that's exactly what we did. For the last three years, we have been building a huge volumetric camera chamber. It's 10,000 square feet of a stage, enabling to capture the action from any location. We have deployed hundreds of cameras, sending a tremendous amount of information to a huge data center powered by Intel supercomputers. The ability to have this 10,000 feet enables us to fit any kind of action, any kind of performance. It is the size of an average Broadway stage. We call it Intel Studios, and it's the largest volumetric stage in the world, with the objective of enabling and exploring the next generation of this immersive media filmmaking."", '05:23': ""Now, to test these ideas, we were thinking about what we can do as the first scene to try it out. So we chose the Western scene. We brought horses, set designers, dirt, everything needed to create the full scene of a Western. But this time, there was no camera inside. There was nothing really moving besides all the cameras installed outside. The challenge of the actors was tremendous. They have to perform a flawless action visible from all the directions. There's no possibility to hide a punch or not show the action. Everything is captured and everything is seen."", '06:10': ""The output of the capture -- this is our future capture -- opened our eyes for the immense capabilities. It was like a full 3D scan of the entire scene. We were able to move around and travel in the space. The thing about this, it's not anymore about perceiving the light emitted from a screen but now traveling inside the light, traveling inside the scene. This obviously opens possibilities for an enormous amount of storytelling and methodologies of creation. This is the possibilities of your personal narrative, the possibility of creating your own story inside, or maybe following other stories. Let's take a look at one of the last renders and see."", '06:54': '(Music)', '06:55': ""What you're seeing here is full volumetric video, and there's no physical camera in the scene."", '07:00': '(Music)', '07:02': 'We have the full control', '07:04': '(Music, sounds of combat)', '07:06': 'of space and time.', '07:07': '(Music, sounds of combat)', '07:18': 'Now, again, no physical camera was here. Everything was captured surrounding.', '07:24': 'Now, this is very nice, but what if we wanted to see the scene, maybe, from the eyes of the horse? Well, we can do that as well.', '07:33': '(Horse galloping)', '07:34': ""So what you're seeing right now is the same action, but this time, we're watching exactly from the eyes of the horse. The possibilities are, well, unlimited."", '07:45': '(Applause)', '07:46': 'Thank you.', '07:48': '(Applause)', '07:51': 'So this is all great for creators and storytellers. It really opens a huge canvas for a different type of storytelling and moviemaking. But what about the audience? How can the audience experience this differently? In order to [create] our explorations, we partnered with Paramount Pictures in order to explore immersive media in a Hollywood movie production. Together with the director Randal Kleiser, we reimagined the iconic movie of 1978, ""Grease."" Some of you know it, some of you don\'t. A 40-year-old movie, amazing experience. And our goal was really to look at how we can take this iconic action and dance and bring it deeper into the experience, bring it deeper into the audience. Imagine that you can not just watch the movie but get inside it and dance with the actors and dance with the performance. Now we\'re breaking, really, the traditional 2D mindset of thinking, and bringing a much richer possibility of moviemaking and content creation.', '08:57': ""But why watch it on the screen?

Now, obviously, these devices have their own limitations in terms of the data-computing process, so we have to reduce the amount of resolution. So what I'm doing now, I'm placing here a marker, so I'll be able to position exactly where I want everyone to appear. OK. I think we have them here."", '09:50': '(Applause)', '09:56': 'John Travolta, or --', '09:58': '(Laughter)', '09:59': ""a version of him.

But it doesn't have a happy ending. Once upon a time, I was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist."", '00:24': ""Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives and one PhD later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean. I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy. I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and cultures all depend on the sea."", '00:53': ""In the midst of all this, I fell in love. With a fish. There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs, but the ones I just can't get out of my head are parrotfish. Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world, there are 100 species, they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms, but that's the boring stuff. I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish."", '01:22': ""First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae. They are the lawn mowers of the reef. This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land. And there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish left out on the reefs to mow it all down."", '01:46': ""OK, second amazing thing. After all that eating, they poop fine white sand. A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. Sometimes, when scuba diving, I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down. So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach, maybe thank of parrotfish."", '02:16': '(Laughter)', '02:17': 'Third, they have so much style. Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange, polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful. Plus, in true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life. A juvenile outfit, an intermediate getup, and a terminal look.', '02:39': ""Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male, termed sequential hermaphroditism. These large males then gather harems of females to spawn. Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo. And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive strategies."", '03:01': 'Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body. This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites, so they can sleep soundly. I mean, how cool is this?', '03:23': '(Laughter)', '03:25': 'So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory.', '03:34': '(Laughter)', '03:35': ""But with this love comes heartache. Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish. Spearfishing took out the large species, midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species. As both a marine biologist and a single person, I can tell you, there aren't that many fish in the sea."", '04:03': '(Laughter)', '04:05': ""And then, there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture, and as bustling as carnival. Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years. An entire ecosystem erased. This is devastating, because hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on reefs for their nutrition and income. Let that sink in."", '04:42': ""A little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs -- Very Important Parrotfish. Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem. These are critical efforts, but it's not enough. As I stand here today, only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected. Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already gone. We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. And we, humans, are causing it. We also have the solutions. Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land. But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes, and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it."", '05:42': 'Each of us can contribute, though. With our votes, our voices, our food choices, our skills and our dollars. We must overhaul both corporate practices and government policies. We must transform culture. Building community around solutions is the most important thing.', '06:03': ""I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this magnificent planet. Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter. Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope, but rather a desire to be useful. Because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending."", '06:34': 'Thank you.', '06:35': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She published two novels, but is perhaps best known for her short stories, which explored small-town life with stinging language, offbeat humor, and delightfully unsavory scenarios.', '00:46': 'In her spare time O’Connor drew cartoons, and her writing is also brimming with caricature. In her stories, a mother has a face “as broad and innocent as a cabbage,” a man has as much drive as a “floor mop,” and one woman’s body is shaped like “a funeral urn.”', '01:05': 'The names of her characters are equally sly. Take the story “The Life You Save May be Your Own,” where the one-handed drifter Tom Shiftlet wanders into the lives of an old woman named Lucynell Crater and her deaf and mute daughter.', '01:18': 'Though Mrs. Crater is self-assured, her isolated home is falling apart. At first, we may be suspicious of Shiftlet’s motives when he offers to help around the house, but O’Connor soon reveals the old woman to be just as scheming as her unexpected guest– and rattles the reader’s presumptions about who has the upper hand.', '01:37': 'For O’Connor, no subject was off limits. Though she was a devout Catholic, she wasn’t afraid to explore the possibility of pious thought and unpious behavior co-existing in the same person. In her novel The Violent Bear it Away, the main character grapples with the choice to become a man of God – but also sets fires and commits murder. The book opens with the reluctant prophet in a particularly compromising position: “Francis Marion Tarwater’s uncle had been dead for only half a day when the boy got too drunk to finish digging his grave.” This leaves a passerby to “drag the body from the breakfast table where it was still sitting and bury it […] with enough dirt on top to keep the dogs from digging it up.”', '02:18': 'Though her own politics are still debated, O’Connor’s fiction could also be attuned to the racism of the South. In “Everything that Rises Must Converge,” she depicts a son raging at his mother’s bigotry. But the story reveals that he has his own blind spots and suggests that simply recognizing evil doesn’t exempt his character from scrutiny.', '02:37': 'Even as O’Connor probes the most unsavory aspects of humanity, she leaves the door to redemption open a crack. In “A Good Man is Hard to Find,” she redeems an insufferable grandmother for forgiving a hardened criminal, even as he closes in on her family. Though we might balk at the price the woman pays for this redemption, we’re forced to confront the nuance in moments we might otherwise consider purely violent or evil.', '03:01': 'O’Connor’s mastery of the grotesque and her explorations of the insularity and superstition of the South led her to be classified as a Southern Gothic writer. But her work pushed beyond the purely ridiculous and frightening characteristics associated with the genre to reveal the variety and nuance of human character. She knew some of this variety was uncomfortable, and that her stories could be an acquired taste – but she took pleasure in challenging her readers.', '03:27': 'O’Connor died of lupus at the age of 39, after the disease had mostly confined her to her farm in Georgia for twelve years. During those years, she penned much of her most imaginative work. Her ability to flit between revulsion and revelation continues to draw readers to her endlessly surprising fictional worlds. As her character Tom Shiftlet notes, the body is “like a house: it don’t go anywhere, but the spirit, lady, is like an automobile: always on the move.”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If it’s a 9 pixel by 9 pixel painting, in the first row he’d paint, skip 7, and then paint again. In the second row he’d skip the first, paint, skip 5, and paint. And so on. The pattern here is that for each row the pixels skipped at the beginning go up by one, and the pixels skipped in the middle go down by 2. Things get more complicated when Hedge reaches the center. Here there’s a row with just one pixel painted. Then the whole thing reverses— the number of pixels skipped goes down by one each time on the left, and up by two each time in the middle.', '04:19': 'Instructing Hedge to do this with a series of loops will work and is a perfectly fine solution. The main drawback is that this requires quite a bit of logic— knowing what to do in the middle, when to reverse the process, and exactly how to reverse it.', '04:34': 'So how might we approach this so that the logic remains consistent from start to finish? The key insight is to look at a grid as a series of concentric squares. Each square follows the same pattern— painted pixels in the corners, and unaltered pixels in between. So if we can figure out a way to paint one nested square, transition to the next, and repeat, we can paint them all.', '05:00': 'Painting the outermost one is easy. Start in a corner and paint that pixel. If we call the length of the painting n, fly forward n minus 1 spaces. Paint another pixel, and turn right. Now do the whole thing again… and again. Now move forward one less space, turn right, fly forward once, and Hedge will be in the next concentric square and ready to repeat the whole process. Each square is n minus 2 pixels smaller than the last in length and width, and we can follow this spiral pattern all the way to the center with a loop and a variable that tracks how far Hedge should fly.', '05:42': 'Is one of these methods better than the other? It really depends on what you value. The strength of the spiral is the simplicity of finding a pattern and reusing the same logic from start to finish. The advantage of the typewriter approach is that it’s a more generalized solution, meaning it can be adapted much more simply to fill in any pattern. For Ethic’s sake, either will do just fine.', '06:05': 'So here’s what happens.', '06:07': 'Hedge rapidly defaces all of the portraits. And within moments cries of anguish break out all over the forest.', '06:15': 'The garrison guarding the tower abandon their posts to calm the agitated people, and Ethic, Hedge, and Octavia slip through— and nearly slip into the depths of the gorge standing between them and the tower.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection ""Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair"" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties of love and enchantment. In ""Poem VI,"" for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his collection ""All the Odes"" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, te vi, muerto.', '01:58': 'Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in a three volume poetry collection titled ""Residence on Earth."" Many of these poems were experimental and surreal, merging epic landscapes, supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the destruction of the Spanish Civil War.', '03:01': 'For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential ""Canto General."" The book attempts to retell the entire history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements.', '03:35': 'Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause of death as cancer.', '04:14': 'Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments worth fighting for.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something was overloading the computer, and threatened to abort the landing.', '00:31': ""Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton held her breath. She'd led the team developing the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission had no room for error. But the nature of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software was working exactly as planned."", '00:48': 'Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy, before taking a research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer while developing software to support research into the new field of chaos theory.', '01:10': ""Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team."", '01:28': 'NASA looked to Draper and his group of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space.', '01:54': 'Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term “software engineering,"" was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time.', '02:24': ""But this kind of adaptable program was difficult to build, since early software could only process jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task a unique priority to ensure that each job occurred in the correct order and at the right time— regardless of any surprises."", '02:51': 'After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software communicated directly— and asynchronously— with a pilot.', '03:17': 'It was these fail safes that triggered the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential on their journey home, but here it was using up vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs to be processed— including the programs necessary for landing. The Priority Displays gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, Mission Control gave the order.', '03:59': 'The Apollo 11 landing was about the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any crewed Apollo missions.', '04:26': 'After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software first guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think about technology.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, in the last, oh, few years, researchers around the world have taken up the task of trying to build robots that are so small that they can't be seen. And what we're going to tell you about today is an effort at Cornell University and now at the University of Pennsylvania to try to build tiny robots."", '01:33': ""OK, so that's the goal.

But steal from what? Well, believe it or not, most of the technology you need to build a tiny robot already exists. The semiconductor industry has been getting better and better at making tinier and tinier devices, so at this point they could put something like a million transistors into the size of a package that is occupied by, say, a single-celled paramecium. And it's not just electronics. They can also build little sensors, LEDs, whole communication packages that are too small to be seen."", '02:26': ""So that's what we're going to do. We're going to steal that technology."", '02:30': ""Here's a robot."", '02:31': '(Laughter)', '02:33': ""Robot's got two parts, as it turns out.

It's such a beautiful little machine. It's incredibly intelligent, it's got great communication skills, and it's all in a package that you can hold in your hand. So we would like to be able to build something like this, only down at the cellular scale, the size of a paramecium."", '03:18': ""And here it is. This is our cell-sized smartphone. It even kind of looks like a smartphone, only it's about 10,000 times smaller. We call it an OWIC."", '03:29': '[Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits]', '03:32': ""OK, we're not advertisers, all right?"", '03:34': '(Laughter)', '03:37': ""But it's pretty cool all by itself. In fact, this OWIC has a number of parts. So up near the top, there are these cool little solar cells that you shine light on the device and it wakes up a little circuit that's there in the middle. And that circuit can drive a little tiny LED that can blink at you and allows the OWIC to communicate with you. So unlike your cell phone, the OWIC communicates with light, sort of like a tiny firefly."", '04:01': ""Now, one thing that's pretty cool about these OWICs is we don't make them one at a time, soldering all the pieces together. We make them in massive parallel. For example, about a million of these OWICs can fit on a single four-inch wafer. And just like your phone has different apps, you can have different kinds of OWICs. There can be ones that, say, measure voltage, some that measure temperature, or just have a little light that can blink at you to tell you that it's there."", '04:27': ""So that's pretty cool, these tiny little devices. And I'd like to tell you about them in a little more detail. But first, I have to tell you about something else. I'm going to tell you a few things about pennies that you might not know."", '04:40': ""So this one is a little bit older penny. It's got a picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the back. But the first thing you might not know, that if you zoom in, you'll find in the center of this thing you can actually see Abraham Lincoln, just like in the real Lincoln Memorial not so far from here. What I'm sure you don't know, that if you zoom in even further --"", '04:58': '(Laughter)', '05:00': ""you'll see that there's actually an OWIC on Abe Lincoln's chest."", '05:04': '(Laughter)', '05:06': 'But the cool thing is, you could stare at this all day long and you would never see it. It\'s invisible to the naked eye. These OWICs are so small, and we make them in such parallel fashion, that each OWIC costs actually less than a penny. In fact, the most expensive thing in this demo is that little sticker that says ""OWIC.""', '05:27': '(Laughter)', '05:32': 'That cost about eight cents.', '05:34': '(Laughter)', '05:37': ""Now, we're very excited about these things for all sorts of reasons. For example, we can use them as little tiny secure smart tags, more identifying than a fingerprint. We're actually putting them inside of other medical instruments to give other information, and even starting to think about putting them in the brain to listen to neurons one at a time."", '05:55': ""In fact, there's only one thing wrong with these OWICs: it's not a robot. It's just a head."", '06:01': '(Laughter)', '06:02': ""And I think we'll all agree that half a robot really isn't a robot at all. Without the legs, we've got basically nothing."", '06:12': ""MM: OK, so you need the legs, too, if you want to build a robot. Now, here it turns out you can't just steal some preexisting technology. If you want legs for your tiny robot, you need actuators, parts that move. They have to satisfy a lot of different requirements. They need to be low voltage. They need to be low power, too. But most importantly, they have to be small. If you want to build a cell-sized robot, you need cell-sized legs. Now, nobody knows how to build that. There was no preexisting technology that meets all of those demands. To make our legs for our tiny robots, we had to make something new."", '06:45': ""So here's what we built. This is one of our actuators, and I'm applying a voltage to it. When I do, you can see the actuator respond by curling up. Now, this might not look like much, but if we were to put a red blood cell up on the screen, it'd be about that big, so these are unbelievably tiny curls. They're unbelievably small, and yet this device can just bend and unbend, no problem, nothing breaks. So how do we do it? Well, the actuator is made from a layer of platinum just a dozen atoms or so thick. Now it turns out, if you take platinum and put it in water and apply a voltage to it, atoms from the water will attach or remove themselves from the surface of the platinum, depending on how much voltage you use. This creates a force, and you can use that force for voltage-controlled actuation. The key here was to make everything ultrathin. Then your actuator is flexible enough to bend to these small sizes without breaking, and it can use the forces that come about from just attaching or removing a single layer of atoms."", '07:36': ""Now, we don't have to build these one at a time, either. In fact, just like the OWICs, we can build them massively in parallel as well. So here's a couple thousand or so actuators, and all I'm doing is applying a voltage, and they all wave, looking like nothing more than the legs of a future robot army."", '07:52': '(Laughter)', '07:55': ""So now we've got the brains and we've got the brawn. We've got the smarts and the actuators. The OWICs are the brains. They give us sensors, they give us power supplies, and they give us a two-way communication system via light. The platinum layers are the muscle. They're what's going to move the robot around. Now we can take those two pieces, put them together and start to build our tiny, tiny robots. The first thing we wanted to build was something really simple. This robot walks around under user control. In the middle are some solar cells and some wiring attached to it. That's the OWIC. They're connected to a set of legs which have a platinum layer and these rigid panels that we put on top that tell the legs how to fold up, which shape they should take. The idea is that by shooting a laser at the different solar cells, you can choose which leg you want to move and make the robot walk around."", '08:40': ""Now, of course, we don't build those one at a time, either. We build them massively in parallel as well. We can build something like one million robots on a single four-inch wafer. So, for example, this image on the left, this is a chip, and this chip has something like 10,000 robots on it. Now, in our world, the macro world, this thing looks like it might be a new microprocessor or something. But if you take that chip and you put it under a microscope, what you're going to see are thousands and thousands of tiny robots."", '09:05': ""Now, these robots are still stuck down. They're still attached to the surface that we built them on. In order for them to walk around, we have to release them. We wanted to show you how we do that live, how we release the robot army, but the process involves highly dangerous chemicals, like, really nasty stuff, and we're like a mile from the White House right now? Yeah. They wouldn't let us do it. So --"", '09:28': '(Laughter)', '09:30': ""so we're going to show you a movie instead. (Laughs) What you're looking at here are the final stages of robot deployment. We're using chemicals to etch the substrate out from underneath the robots. When it dissolves, the robots are free to fold up into their final shapes. Now, you can see here, the yield's about 90 percent, so almost every one of those 10,000 robots we build, that's a robot that we can deploy and control later."", '09:53': ""And we can take those robots and we can put them places as well. So if you look at the movie on the left, that's some robots in water. I'm going to come along with a pipette, and I can vacuum them all up. Now when you inject the robots back out of that pipette, they're just fine. In fact, these robots are so small, they're small enough to pass through the thinnest hypodermic needle you can buy. Yeah, so if you wanted to, you could inject yourself full of robots."", '10:18': '(Laughter)', '10:20': ""I think they're into it."", '10:21': '(Laughter)', '10:24': ""On the right is a robot that we put in some pond water. I want you to wait for just one second. Ooop! You see that? That was no shark. That was a paramecium. So that's the world that these things live in."", '10:38': 'OK, so this is all well and good, but you might be wondering at this point, ""Well, do they walk?"" Right? That\'s what they\'re supposed to do. They better. So let\'s find out.', '10:48': ""So here's the robot and here are its solar cells in the middle. Those are those little rectangles. I want you to look at the solar cell closest to the top of the slide. See that little white dot? That's a laser spot. Now watch what happens when we start switching that laser between different solar cells on the robot. Off it goes!"", '11:08': '(Applause)', '11:11': 'Yeah!', '11:12': '(Applause)', '11:17': ""Off goes the robot marching around the microworld. Now, one of the things that's cool about this movie is: I'm actually piloting the robot in this movie. In fact, for six months, my job was to shoot lasers at tiny cell-sized robots to pilot them around the microworld. This was actually my job. As far as I could tell, that is the coolest job in the world."", '11:38': '(Laughter)', '11:39': ""It was just the feeling of total excitement, like you're doing the impossible. It's a feeling of wonder like that first time I looked through a microscope as a kid staring at that rotifer."", '11:49': ""Now, I'm a dad, I have a son of my own, and he's about three years old. But one day, he's going to look through a microscope like that one. And I often wonder: What is he going to see? Instead of just watching the microworld, we as humans can now build technology to shape it, to interact with it, to engineer it. In 30 years, when my son is my age, what will we do with that ability? Will microrobots live in our bloodstream, as common as bacteria? Will they live on our crops and get rid of pests? Will they tell us when we have infections, or will they fight cancer cell by cell?"", '12:29': ""PM: And one cool part is, you're going to be able to participate in this revolution. Ten years or so from now, when you buy your new iPhone 15x Moto or whatever it's called --"", '12:39': '(Laughter)', '12:40': ""it may come with a little jar with a few thousand tiny robots in it that you can control by an app on your cell phone. So if you want to ride a paramecium, go for it.

https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_schulman_what_covid_19_means_for_the_future_of_commerce_capitalism_and_cash,"What COVID-19 means for the future of commerce, capitalism and cash","Capitalism needs an upgrade, says PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, and it starts with paying people enough to actually invest in their futures. He discusses why companies need to cultivate trust to recover and rebuild after the COVID-19 pandemic -- and how we can use this defining moment to create a more inclusive, ethical economy. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED business curator Corey Hajim and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded on May 19, 2020.)",0:49:09,49.15,253595,2020-05-29T19:47:17+00:00,"['capitalism', 'work', 'finance', 'money', 'business', 'economics']","['English', 'Español', 'Português brasileiro', 'Türkçe']",Dan Schulman,"President and CEO, PayPal","{'00:05': 'Corey Hajim: Today, our guest is Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal. When most of us think of PayPal, we think of buying something online or paying a friend back for a drink using Venmo. But PayPal has also become a major financial services player, often acting as an alternative to a traditional bank. During this pandemic, PayPal has supported small businesses around the world by providing loans, waiving fees and increasing cash back programs. It has also worked with the US government on its Paycheck Protection Program, as well as distributing stimulus checks. It has enabled an outpouring of generosity online as well. The trend towards digital payments, or what we might now want to think of as ""contactless payments,"" has massively accelerated, and it\'s changing forever how we think about commerce. So I\'m really excited to have Dan here with us. Thank you so much, Dan.', '01:07': 'Dan Schulman: Thanks for having me, Corey. Pleasure to be here with you.', '01:11': ""CH: Glad to see you. So let's dive right in. Within a few months of this pandemic's arrival, more than 30 million people have filed for unemployment in the United States alone. These are certainly unusual circumstances, but it seems clear we were running very close to the edge, and now so many businesses and their employees are facing huge financial challenges. How worried are you?"", '01:41': ""DS: Well, I think the crisis has exposed three things. Obviously, it's a health crisis for so many people. Second thing is, that health crisis has ricocheted, and the world is now in an economic crisis. And the third crisis that we don't talk so much about but I think is impacting the way that we're going to live our lives going forward is: this is a psychological crisis as well. People are reexamining their place in the world, what's happening in the world, how they're going to live their lives, both in the pandemic and postpandemic. And so I think this is something that each of those phases will need to be dealt with."", '02:32': ""But you said this, and I completely agree with you: there was an economic crisis happening well before the pandemic exposed this. It's kind of like the water level came down and exposed what was already there. You had, for instance, in the US, 185 million adults in the US struggling to make ends meet at the end of the month. You have over 70 million adults that are really outside of the financial system, spending over 140 billion dollars on high interest rates, unnecessary fees and struggling as well. And so I think what this has really done -- because you can't ignore 20, 25 percent unemployment rates -- it's exposed this crisis and forced a lot of people into, maybe, actions that they might not have taken without this crisis happening."", '03:39': ""CH: Yeah, I think that's right. There are so many challenges and so many opportunities, and I think you've spoken of this opportunity of digital transactions being helpful to people, and obviously the trend, as you've said, has massively accelerated and pushed us into this world even further. So I'm curious: What does the world look like without cash? Or less cash? What are the advantages and what are the challenges of making that transition?"", '04:11': ""DS: I think some of the trends that are emerging coming out of this pandemic or coming into it and as we look forward is, clearly, this has been a discontinuous change in the trend line as we move from physical to digital. I think we've accelerated many forms of digital capabilities by three to five years. And that can be from digital payments to telemedicine to really changing the face of retail and how we think about retailing, changing the face of entertainment, even changing the way governments think about managing and moving money and really thinking about digital currencies going forward. And so I think there are a tremendous number of changes that will occur during this pandemic and coming out of it. Digital payments is obviously one of the big ones that will happen. I mean, cash has been around for quite some time, thousands of years. I would not be so bold as to predict its full demise. Many people have been wrong doing that. But there is no question right now that you will see an acceleration of the demise of cash. Last year, you had over 18 trillion dollars of cash spent at retail. Eighty-five percent of the world's transactions today are done in cash still. But the really big change right now towards digital payments, and that's both the advent and the acceleration of commerce that's happening, as well as the shift to in-store contactless payments, as you said, and the real impetus for that is health reasons. People do not want to hand over money. They do not want to touch screens. They don't want to pick up a pen and sign at the point of sale. And so there is a demand for contactless payments and digital payments to keep social distancing requirements in place, to protect the health of cashiers, to protect the health of consumers. And I think we are going to see, we are already seeing in our business, a surge in digital payments across the world."", '06:52': ""CH: It seems like a great opportunity, but how do we make sure that this transition is inclusive? I mean, you've talked about how so many people are underserved by the traditional banking industry. How do we make sure that those people have that opportunity? And it feels like a smartphone becomes an essential item. How do we address that?"", '07:16': ""DS: Yeah. I do think that a mobile is really a key to unlocking this. I've often said that, really, one of the big moon shots for the financial services industry is this idea of not just financial inclusion. Most people define financial inclusion by somebody having access to a bank account, but just having access to a bank account is not nearly enough. I think what we need to aim for is how do we think about financial health? How do we make sure that people have the ability to have some wherewithal to create savings to withstand some kind of financial shock to the system? I do think that mobile phones will be the way that this occurs and will be very inclusive going forward."", '08:13': ""There are going to be something like six billion smartphones in the world over the next several years. The cost of a smartphone is plummeting. I think in India now you can buy a smartphone for under 25 dollars. So you're going to have ubiquity of smartphones across the world, and, in fact, what's very interesting is, in lower-income populations, there is a greater penetration of smartphones than in higher income because the smartphone is the only device that somebody has. Higher-income individuals may have desktops or iPads, that kind of thing, but lower income can afford one device, and they choose it to be a smartphone because they can get and live their life through that one device."", '09:04': ""And think about that one device. Really, you have all the power of a bank branch in the palm of your hands. And when you can start to create distribution of services, financial services, through a smartphone, you then are able to manage and move money in ways that we couldn't do traditionally."", '09:30': ""In the physical world, if you get a check, you need to then go to a cash checking place to cash it. You stand in line for 30 minutes. They then charge you anywhere between two and five percent to just change the format of currency from a check to cash. And then you have cash and you want to pay a bill. You need to stand in line again at a bill pay, and then you have to pay maybe 10 dollars for an individual bill as a fee. If you do that via a smartphone, I believe that not only do you save a tremendous amount of time, because if you're outside the financial system, managing and moving money is practically a part-time job to go and do that, so not only do you save time and return time to individuals, but you can cut the cost of transactions by anywhere between 50 and 75 percent. And remember that $140 billion number that I gave you? And that's just in the US. Imagine if you could cut that in half and return that to the most vulnerable populations that need it most. So I think there's tremendous promise in the use of technology to help provide both inclusion and make sure there aren't digital haves and have-nots, but also to start on this journey towards financial health."", '10:58': ""CH: Yeah, I think a lot of people don't realize that you don't need a bank account or even a credit card to open a PayPal account, which is super-interesting. I mean, do you see a time where traditional banks don't exist or at least play a much smaller role in the financial services industry?"", '11:18': ""DS: Well, I think the entire financial services industry is evolving right now, and so I think banks will always play a role, or as far into the future as I can see, but it will evolve. I mean, think about basic credit cards. Today, you think about a credit card, and you think about it predominantly as a form factor, something that you pull out of your pocket. Sometimes there's status associated with what you're pulling out of your pocket, depending on the color of that credit card. But really I think those form factors start to go away and become embedded in digital wallets. So credit will always be an important element."", '12:07': ""You know, most people in the world, it isn't that their cash outlays exceed their cash intake. It's just that they're not evenly distributed. So there are times where your cash outflows exceed your cash intake, and there, you need some form of credit to make up that difference. And so I think forms of credit will always be an important element. But the way that you extend credit will change going forward, the way that you think about scoring people in terms of can they handle credit. You know, traditionally, in more developed countries, you use what's called FICO scores or bureau scores, but those ignore so many of the financial transactions that people who are outside the financial system do, like paying rent or paying their bills on time. And with the data and information and machine learning around that -- and we need to be careful that there aren't biases built into those algorithms -- we can start to do things that could never be done before."", '13:20': ""I'll just give you one quick example. We're one of the largest providers of working capital to small businesses in the world. We're probably one of the top five in the United States. So we've done over 14, 15 billion dollars of lending of working capital to small businesses. Seventy percent of that goes to the 30 percent of counties where 10 or more banks have closed branches. And where do banks close branches? Banks close branches in neighborhoods where the median income is below the national average, which makes sense because for a branch to be profitable, they need a certain amount of deposits for that branch to actually be profitable. And so, in lower income neighborhoods, branches are starting to close. So why are 70 percent of our loans in those lower income neighborhoods? It's because we do machine learning. We don't even look at FICO scores or bureau scores. We look at a number of different data elements. And so we can lend into those lower income neighborhoods where nobody else can, and when we do that, the average sale of a small business goes up by 22 percent. And imagine the impact that has on communities and neighborhoods where they can finally get the working capital to expand those small businesses. And I think that's a perfect example of the promise of what technology and financial services married together can do."", '14:55': ""CH: I think it's so interesting. I'm curious. The tech industry has been criticized for amassing power over society, not that the banking industry isn't criticized. But what do you say about people who might be worried about tech companies taking on even more influence and control over what's happening in their lives?"", '15:19': ""DS: Yeah. Well, I think what's so important for any company and tech companies is to respect the boundaries in terms of what consumers expect from a company that serves them. I think the most important brand attribute that a company can have is trust, and trust comes from the understanding that a company respects your privacy and will not sell your data or information, that it can perform transactions in a secure manner so that your transactions are protected. And I think those are kind of foundational, and I think any company needs to respect that. They need to assure that consumers have the privacy that they desire and the safety and security that is required to serve them the right way."", '16:31': ""CH: And obviously, you've gained a lot of trust with the US government. Maybe we could talk a little bit about how you've been working with them to distribute some money through the Paycheck Protection Program. And I was curious, I've been reading about it, and it sounds like 30 million-ish small businesses in the United States are able to get those funds, but only six million have received the loans. What do you think's happened?"", '17:01': 'DS: Yep. Well, I think initially, the government -- and I give them a lot of credit -- they responded quite quickly with a 3 trillion dollar stimulus package. These are massive numbers that were happening in very condensed time frames. We were working with various agencies, very closely with the Treasury Department, in terms of distribution of the stimulus. And they were working literally night and day on this. The Small Business Administration was working night and day. But these are volumes that have never been seen before running through these systems, and the first tranche of those loans was very difficult. There were a lot of technical difficulties in getting those out to small businesses. And that first tranche was not enough, and it was quickly used, and there are still a host of small businesses that needed money.', '18:14': ""The second tranche that came out is still actually in effect. It has not been used up, and we are continuing to lend on that. We've been able to lend to some 50,000 small businesses. We've lent out about 1.7 billion dollars, and our loan size, which really I'm proud of, is about 31,000 dollars. The average that a bank does is between 100 and 125,000 dollars. So we are lending to these true small businesses on Main Street, and I'm proud that we've been able to go do that, and I think we should give credit to the US government and governments around the world that are taking this quite seriously and putting a tremendous amount, a percentage of their GDP, towards the rescue of small businesses and towards trying to take care of consumers that find themselves in really difficult straits right now."", '19:21': ""And we've been trying to, instead of people mailing out checks, which is ridiculous in today's world -- people aren't living where they think they're going to be living, they're with their parents or with friends or in a different location, and mailing a check and then having to take a check and go somewhere, which you can't even go if you're sheltered in place, to cash it, doing that electronically just makes a ton more sense -- and we've been working with the IRS and Treasury and other government agencies to distribute that electronically."", '19:53': ""CH: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. It's a massive, massive project for all of us. Whitney is here with some questions from our community."", '20:04': 'DS: Hello, Whitney.', '20:06': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello Dan. How are you? So the community has some interesting questions following up on what you were talking about earlier about security. We have a question from Marc -- and I apologize in advance if I mispronounce your name, Marc -- Marc Vanlerberghe: ""The move to digital cash could be one more step towards creating the perfect surveillance state. How do we avoid this from happening?""', '20:27': ""DS: Yeah, well, this is what I was talking about, Marc, before. I mean, I think this idea of trust is incredibly important. I think the only companies that will be successful -- and I think we hold a lot of this in our own hands as consumers, by the way; we need to be aware of data and information that we're giving and to what companies we're doing that with -- but I think the companies that will be successful are those that have a high degree of trust, and trust happens by protecting your privacy but also very much assuring that your transactions in a digital world are safe and secure. I mean, the idea of cybersecurity has always been important, but is ever more important as we move from physical to digital, and that's where large data sets are important, because a consumer's identity is stolen every two seconds. Every two seconds, some consumer has their identity stolen. And so we have to be, for instance, we have to be sure that even when you sign in with your credentials, they're actually real credentials. We have to look at 30 to 100 different elements of that transaction to make sure it's really you before we let that money out of your account. And so there is a combination of making sure you have enough data to protect somebody but also assure that your privacy is held sacrosanct, and I think that is a balancing act and one that needs to happen in order for us to do this successfully."", '22:19': 'WPR: Great, and actually sort of going from digital cash to digital currency, we have another question from Simone Ross in our community about the opportunity that exists for digital currency. She mentioned that PayPal pulled out of Libra. What would it take for a truly inclusive digital currency to take hold here?', '22:39': ""DS: Yeah. I think there is a tremendous amount of promise as we think about digital currencies. Our pulling out of Libra had nothing to do with our firm conviction that blockchain and other forms of maybe stable coin currencies are extremely important and can be very, very helpful, especially in different parts of the world. As we think about stability in different parts of the world where currencies can fluctuate up and down, to have a more stable currency where somebody can know, if they have that, that it's going to be worth x amount, and that they can transact, either with other individuals around the world or, importantly, at merchants around the world. And we are looking at all forms of digital currencies right now, working hand in hand with a number of different governments, and I think we should all think about how technology is going to evolve and how currencies will evolve as a result of that. And I think this crisis has really opened the eyes of many governments around the world as to the need for different tool sets to create stimulus and to efficiently and quickly and effectively distribute funds to their citizens."", '24:23': 'WPR: Great. Well, I\'ll be back shortly with more questions, and I\'d just love to remind the community that you can ask questions on the ""Ask question"" feature. Be sure to use the pull-down tab to select Episode 2, so those questions come. Thank you.', '24:36': 'DS: Thanks, Whitney.', '24:37': ""CH: Thanks, Whitney. Dan, I want to go back to something we touched on in the beginning about financial wellness. PayPal has done something unique in terms of calculating how much to pay people and how much you should spend on benefits. Traditionally, wages are set by the market, but you've found that paying as much or even more than other companies wasn't always enough. Can you tell us about that moment?"", '25:07': 'DS: Yeah. So I said, kind of, in our opening, in one of my opening statements, that two-thirds of Americans struggle to make ends meet at the end of the month. They are financially stressed, and it kind of wreaks havoc in their life. I did a study to look at PayPal employees. We did a research study, and I did it because I thought I was going to get back this great information that I was going to talk about at an employee meeting about how well we pay, because we pay, to your point, at or above market in every single location around the world. And what I found is, unfortunately, like the rest of the world, even though we paid at market or above market, 60 percent of our operations personnel, our entry-level employees, our hourly workers, face the same thing. They struggle to make ends meet. And that was simply unacceptable for me.', '26:20': 'I think the world is changing in terms of the responsibility of corporations, the responsibility of CEOs. We have a lot of different stakeholders that we try to satisfy, from regulators to shareholders to customers to employees. But I think the number one responsibility that we have is the health -- financial health -- of our employees, because nothing could be more important to a company than to have financially secure, passionate employees working for you, because nobody is going to serve customers better than employees who feel a part of something and feel financially secure and glad to be a part of that company.', '27:09': 'And so then the real question becomes: How do you measure that? Because a lot of people think about living wages or a minimum wage. And we thought that was insufficient, and we came up with a measurement we called ""net disposable income,"" which is, basically: After you pay taxes and your basically essential living expenses, how much money do you have left over for discretionary things or to save? And here\'s the really unfortunate thing -- and I\'m not proud of this, but remember, we were paying at market or above, so I thought the market would take care of this, right, by doing that -- we found that for that population, they had four to six percent NDI, net disposable income, after paying taxes and essential living expenses. That is not enough. You are going to struggle to make ends meet. And by the way, NDI changes location to location to location around the globe, right? There\'s a different NDI in Manila, a different NDI in Omaha, Nebraska, than there is in New York City, etc. And so we basically said to ourselves, we need to take NDI to 20 percent. Because at 20 percent -- and that\'s a huge shift, from four to six to 20 percent -- but at 20 percent, you actually have the ability to save and to put money away and to take care of discretionary expenses.', '28:46': 'And so we did a pretty massive reorientation of our compensation systems. We lowered the cost of benefits by 58 percent, because benefits are like a regressive tax, you pay the same amount no matter what your salary is. And so we had a lot of employees who weren\'t taking health care benefits, because it cost too much to be able to do that. So we lowered it by 58 percent. We made every single employee of PayPal a shareholder and an owner of the business, and we gave them pretty big grants so that they could be a part of the success of PayPal going forward. We raised salaries where we needed to go and do that. And then we wrapped all of that into a financial education program, because people had never gotten equity before, they were trying to think through, ""How do I save now that I\'ve got incremental dollars to go and do that?"" And that cost us quite a bit of money to go and do that, but I really feel, just like how we spend a lot of money to take care of customers, as you mentioned up front, in COVID-19, that companies need to stand for more than just making money, for more than just maximizing our profits next quarter. I firmly, firmly believe that the costs associated with taking care of our employees, taking care of our customers, will benefit us in the long run multiplefold over the costs associated with doing that. And we\'re already beginning to see some of the impact of that.', '30:33': ""And so, I think every CEO, every company, needs to really now start to think about, especially maybe as a result of this crisis, but as I mentioned, we had a crisis before this, how do we put our employees first, take care of them? Because if you do that, you'll take care of customers, and if you take care of customers, you'll take of shareholders, inevitably. And so this has been a huge part of it about for the last year or so."", '31:10': ""CH: It's so interesting, and it brings up so many questions, I think, for me and probably our community as well. I mean, PayPal is a hugely profitable tech business, huge free cash flow and big margins. Do you think this model is something that every company can do, whether it's a tech company, a manufacture, a meatpacking business? I mean, is this what everyone should be focused on?"", '31:42': ""DS: Well, I think that -- and I don't want to moralize or tell other companies what they should do -- but to me, I think everyone should understand the financial health of their employees. That's a baseline thing to go do. What you do post-that is up to maybe your financial strength as a company or where you put your order of priorities. But what I've found is, I thought the market could tell you that, and this is why I say, in many ways -- you know, I'm a big believer in capitalism. I think it's, in many ways, the best economic system that I know of. But, like everything, it needs an upgrade. It needs tuning, and at least for these vulnerable populations, just because you pay at market doesn't mean that they have financial health or financial wellness. And I think everyone should know whether or not their employees have the wherewithal to be able to save to withstand financial shocks, and then really understand, like, what can you do about it? I think this NDI measure is a really interesting one. It takes some time to go do it, because you have to be quite thorough and you have to really understand living expenses by location and what tax jurisdictions there are. But you need to create an NDI that's to a certain level where people aren't struggling to make ends meet. Because if people are struggling to make ends meet, they are not as productive at work. They're worried about, like, what am I going to do with my kids? My kid just got sick. I don't have health insurance. I think there's a spiral that occurs. You think you're actually saving money by paying less, but the reality is, at least in my belief system, you take care of your employees, and other things naturally flow from that. They are more productive. They love being a part of that company. They take care of customers better. And all of those things inevitably accrue to the benefit of a company in terms of how it's trying to serve its ultimate end market. But it starts with your employees."", '34:24': 'CH: So obviously you believe in this ""capitalism needs an upgrade,"" and I think NDI is something so many companies should adopt. But do you think this happens through benevolent corporate activity? I\'m channeling my inner Bernie Bro here, but I think a lot of people would be skeptical that we should trust companies to do better at this point. Should the government step in to raise minimum wages, do other things to protect workers in a more structured way?', '34:56': ""DS: Look, I think the government clearly has a role to play, and I think the private and public sectors need to work closer together to address so many of the issues that we face in our societies across the world, whether that be income inequality, environmental issues, health, protections, that kind of thing, privacy. But the way that I think about this is, it's very difficult for governments to regulate around this, because there are so many different ways of thinking about it."", '35:44': ""If I were another CEO, and this is like, it's actually in your best interest to go and do this because it's a competitive advantage. Like, we attract, I think, some of the best talent in the world to PayPal, because we have a mission that people believe in, that we actually are trying to make some sort of positive difference. I'm not saying we're the be-all and end-all, but I don't think people should shirk their responsibilities of at least making a small difference going forward. If enough companies did that, if enough governments did that, it would make a real difference in the world. And then the second thing is, you have to have values that support that. And those values are incredibly important. Those values should be all about inclusion. They should be about having a diverse workforce. They should be about financial wellness. And when you do that, and you attract the very best talent, then by definition, I think the single biggest competitive advantage for any company is their workforce. Strategies are great. A whole number of things are great. You have a great workforce that's passionate about what they're doing and is financially secure, and they will do amazing things. And I think it's that kind of competitive advantage that will spur companies. So there needs to be a set of CEOs and companies that start to move in this direction, and I believe you're beginning to see more do this. And once that happens, it starts to tip everything, and I think more and more need to do it to maintain their competitive positioning. And that may seem like a self-serving way why people are doing it, but honestly, I don't care whether they're doing it out of the goodness of their heart or they're doing it because it's competitively a disadvantage if they don't. Creating financial health for our employees is the goal, and we've got to get that done."", '38:07': ""CH: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you think of this as a win-win, but it also sounds like you're willing to maybe think about your employees first and sell it to your shareholders later. Whitney is -- oh sorry, go ahead."", '38:24': 'DS: No, no, no -- I was just going to say, I actually do believe that, and I think the idea of a multistakeholder capitalism, that is a time for today, and we cannot just think that we have one stakeholder that we need to satisfy. We live in our communities, we live in this world. To have people struggling day in and day out is not good for any company, and ... We can only do x amount, but we can actually create financial health for our employees, and we should.', '39:10': 'WPR: Great. So we have so many questions coming in from the community. One here is from Lara Pearson, basically about whether PayPal would consider become a B Corporation. ""Are you familiar with the B Corp movement, environmentally and socially responsible, multiple-bottom-line for profits? Presuming so, has PayPal considered or would it consider becoming a certified B Corporation?""', '39:30': ""DS: Yep. I'm familiar with B Corp. We have no intention to move to becoming a B Corporation. I think the values and what we are trying to do are very aligned with assuring a multistakeholder point of view, but what I really want is for this to be a movement across major corporations across the world. And you're not going to have major corporations around the world moving into B Corp. There's a lot of other side issues involved with being a B Corporation as opposed to just a publicly listed company, and so that's going to be a long way before that happens. And so what I'm really trying to do is encourage and demonstrate that being multistakeholder, that putting employees first, creates competitive advantage. And I think I'm not the only CEO who's feeling that, by the way. I think people like Satya Nadella from Microsoft are doing a great job, Marc Benioff from Salesforce. I could go through quite a list of names. But the list is not long enough yet, but I think there's some quite important names and individuals around the world who are now talking about multistakeholder capitalism, and I think that's an important element as we think about our economies and way of life looking forward."", '41:27': 'WPR: And there was so much interest also in your net disposable income program and a lot of questions around that, and one which I think is along these same lines from Juan Enriquez asking about a rational way to address extreme income disparities. And perhaps you could expand beyond this program, just sort of ways that we might think about this in a smarter way moving forward.', '41:49': ""DS: Yeah. Well, there's no easy solution, or it would have been done. So I think there are a couple things that I think about that may not fully address extreme income disparities. Again, I try to think pragmatically about these things, and, like, what can we really do to start to address this? And again, I think about, if we could take one step and then another step, then you're starting your journey, and without getting overwhelmed by how far away the end state is. So one, I think compani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s need to take care of their employees, and I think that will immediately help to address some of these income disparities. Number two, I do think that, ironically, if you have less money, it costs you more to manage and move it, which, think about that: the less money you have, if you're outside the financial system," the more you spend to manage and move your money."""""," '43:08': """"And I think that technology is at least a foundational way for us to think about how do we cut the basic costs of managing and moving money by 50 to 70 percent", like [check-cashing], sending remittances, which are such a huge, important part of the world's economy. You know, you do it a traditional way, you go into a store and send the remittance to another store and somebody goes and picks it up. First of all, incredibly time-consuming, and it can cost between eight and 12 percent of that remittance amount that you're sending. So if you're sending a hundred dollars, the recipient who so desperately needs it is getting 88 to 90 dollars. If you do that electronically, digital wallet to digital wallet, that can be like three percent, so you can get 97 dollars from that. And so I think there are ways of addressing the costs. As I mentioned, there is so much money spent on unnecessary fees and high interest rates, and if we can drop that by 20 percent, 30 percent," the amount of money we can return to vulnerable populations is quite large and will start to make a difference.""""", '44:35': 'WPR: That\'s great. We have a ton of questions from the audience, just one more before we turn things back over to Corey with her final questions.

I know that sounds very cliché, but I truly believe it, and I think every one of us can make a difference. But here's what I'm seeing. I'm beginning to see that at a much larger scale than I've ever seen before. You know, we have different platforms, either the PayPal platform or the Venmo platform, Venmo here in the US, PayPal across the world. The amount of giving that's happening through those platforms, whether it be to local businesses, to artists, to musicians, to bartenders, to places of worship, to schools, to NGOs, to charities has exploded on the platform, exploded. We have helped to raise on the PayPal platform since COVID-19 struck 2.8 billion dollars for NGOs and charities -- 2.8 billion. That's incredible, the amount of generosity that is pouring out from the global community around this. And we're just seeing people randomly pay it forward. Somebody gives 20 dollars to a bartender, and that bartender takes 10 dollars of that and gives it to somebody else. And we're watching that over our platform," and that gives me a sense of optimism."""""," '46:46': """"I also feel like this period of time has exposed a number of things that were happening but were invisible", and I think when things become visible, that's when you can start to address them, and I think there's a lot of attention on some issues that should have had attention before, but vulnerable populations don't have as loud a voice as others, and now that voice is being heard, because you can't ignore it.

https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_trombley_the_beauty_and_complexity_of_finding_common_ground,The beauty and complexity of finding common ground,"How can we disagree with one another, respectfully and productively? In this thoughtful talk, team builder Matt Trombley reflects on ""agonism"" -- the tendency to take a rigid stance on issues -- and shares why finding aspects of agreement can be the first step in resolving conflict. ""When you can find even the smallest bit of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person,"" he says.",0:13:52,13.86666667,257262,2020-06-26T14:49:40+00:00,"['humanity', 'community', 'communication', 'personal growth', 'relationships']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Ελληνικά', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)']",Matt Trombley,"Maven, teacher, team builder","{'00:05': 'So our story started several years ago, when my wife and I got a complaint letter in the mail from an anonymous neighbor.', '00:13': '(Laughter)', '00:15': ""I'll never forget the way my wife transformed before my eyes from this graceful, peaceful, sweet woman into just an angry mother grizzly bear whose cubs needed to be protected. It was intense. So here's what happened."", '00:32': ""This is our family. This is my wife and I and our five awesome kids. We're pretty loud, we're pretty rambunctious, we're us. You'll notice, though, that two of our children look a little different than Mary and I, and that's because they came to us through adoption. Our neighbor, though, saw two different-looking children playing outside of our house every day and came to the conclusion that we must have been running an illegal day care out of our home."", '00:58': '(Murmuring)', '01:02': ""We were really angry to have our children stereotyped like that, but I know that's a relatively minor example of racial profiling. But isn't it sometimes what we all tend to do with people who think differently, or believe differently or maybe even vote differently? Instead of engaging as true neighbors, we keep our distance and our actions towards those are guided by who we think sees the world as we do or who we think doesn't."", '01:33': 'See, what my neighbor suffered from is a condition called agonism. And sometimes we all suffer from the same condition. It\'s not a medical condition, but it is contagious. So let\'s talk a little bit about what agonism is. My favorite definition of agonism is taking a warlike stance in contexts that are not literally war. Agonism comes from the same Greek root word ""agon"" from which we get ""agony."" How very appropriate. We all tend to show symptoms of agonism when we hold on to two deeply held beliefs, first identified by author Rick Warren. The first one is that if love someone, we must agree with all they do or believe. And the second is the inverse, that if we disagree with someone, it must mean that we fear or we hate them.', '02:30': ""Not sure we really recognize the agony this way of thinking brings to us, when our relationships die because we think we have to agree or disagree no matter what. Think about the conversations we've had around Brexit, or Hong Kong, maybe Israeli settlements or perhaps impeachment. I bet we could all think of at least one personal relationship that's been strained or maybe even ended because of these topics, or tragically, over a topic much more trivial than those. The cure for agonism is not out of reach. The question is how."", '03:11': 'So might I suggest two strategies that my experience has taught me to start with. First, cultivate common ground, which means focusing on what we share. I want you to know I\'m using my words very, very deliberately. By ""cultivate,"" I mean we have to intentionally work to find common ground with someone. Just like a farmer works to cultivate the soil. And common ground is a common term, so let me at least explain what I don\'t mean, which is I don\'t mean by common ground that we were exact, or that we totally agree and approve. All I mean is that we find one unifying thing that we can have in a relationship in common with another person.', '03:56': ""You know, sometimes that one thing is hard to find. So I'd like to share a personal story, but before I do, let me tell you a little bit more about myself. I'm Caucasian, cisgender male, middle class, evangelical Christian. And I know, as soon as some of those words came out of my mouth, some of you had some perceptions about me. And it's OK, I know that not all those perceptions are positive. But for those who share my faith, know that I'm about to cut across the grain. And you may tune me out as well. So as we go, if you're having a hard time hearing me, I just gently ask that you reflect and see if you're buying into agonism. If you're rejecting me simply because you think you see the world differently than I do, because isn't that what we're here talking about? Alright, ready?"", '04:48': 'So I\'ve been thinking a lot about how to find common ground in the area of gender fluidity, as an evangelical Christian. For Christians like me, we believe that God created us man and woman. So what do I do? Do I throw up my hands and say, ""I can\'t have a relationship with anybody who is transgender or LGBTQIA?"" No. That would be giving into agonism.', '05:16': 'So I started looking at the foundational aspects of my faith, the first of which is that of the three billion genes that make us human -- and by the way, we share 99.9 percent of those genes -- that I believe those three billion genes are the result of an intelligent designer. And that immediately gives me common ground with anybody. What it also gives me ... is the belief that each and every one of us have been given the right to life by that same intelligent designer.', '05:55': ""I dug deeper though. I found that my faith didn't teach me to start relationships by arguing with somebody until they believed what I believed, or I convinced them. No, it taught me to start relationships by loving them as a coequal member of the human race. Honestly though, some who share my faith draw a line and refuse to address somebody by their preferred gender pronoun. But isn't that believing the lie that in order for me to honor you, I have to give up what I believe?"", '06:30': ""Come back in time with me -- let's say it's 20 years ago, and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep. And you open the door. Would you address him as Muhammad Ali or his former name of Cassius Clay? I'm guessing that most of you would say Muhammad Ali. And I'm also guessing that most of you wouldn't think we'd have to immediately convert to Islam, just by using his name. To honor him would cost me, would cost any of us absolutely nothing, and it would give us the common ground to have a relationship. And it's the relationship that cures agonism, not giving up what we believe."", '07:13': ""So for me to honor my faith, it means rejecting these rigid symptoms of agonism. Meaning, I can and I will love you. I can and I will accept you, and I don't have to buy into the lie that if I do these things, I have to give up what I believe or chose to fear and hate you. Because I'm focusing on what we have in common."", '07:39': 'When you can find even the smallest bit of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand just the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person.', '07:58': 'Our second strategy gives us room to (Inhales) breathe. To pause. To calm down. To have the kind of relationships that cure agonism. And how to keep those relationships alive. Our second strategy is to exchange extravagant grace.', '08:22': '(Laughs)', '08:24': ""Once again, I'm not mincing words -- by grace, I don't mean we should all go sign up for ballet, that would be weird."", '08:30': '(Laughter)', '08:31': 'What I mean is not canceling everything over one mistake. Even if that mistake personally offended you. Maybe even deeply. Perhaps Holocaust survivor Corrie ten Boom put it best when she said, ""To forgive is to set a prisoner free, only to realize that prisoner was me."" My faith teaches me that we humans will never be perfect, myself very much included. So we need the grace of a savior, who for me is Jesus. And while I define grace in the context of my faith, I know there\'s a lot of other people who have defined it differently and in different ways. One of my favorites is radio broadcaster Oswald Hoffmann, who said, ""Grace is the love that loves the unlovely and the unlovable."" And I just love that picture of grace. Because I know I am, and maybe a lot of you can think of a time when we\'re just pretty dadgum unlovable.', '09:41': 'So it would be the height of hypocrisy, dare I say repulsive to my faith, for me to accept the unconditional, unqualified grace and love from God and then turn around and put one precondition on the love I give you. What in the world would I be thinking? And by extravagant, I mean over the top, not just checking a box. We can all remember when we were kids and our parents forced us to apologize to somebody and we walked up to them and said, (Angrily) ""I\'m sorry."" We just got it over with, right? That\'s not what we\'re talking about. What we\'re talking about is not having to give someone grace but choosing to and wanting to. That\'s how we exchange extravagant grace.', '10:36': ""Listen, I know this can sound really, really theoretical. So I'd like to tell you about a hero of mine. A hero of grace. It's 2014. In Iran. And the mother of a murdered son is in a public square. The man who murdered her son is also in that square, by a gallows, on a chair of some kind, a noose around his neck and a blindfold over his eyes. Samereh Alinejad had been given the sole right under the laws of her country to either pardon this man or initiate his execution. Put another way, she could pardon him or literally push that chair out from underneath his feet."", '11:30': '(Exhales)', '11:32': ""I just ... I can't picture the agony going through both Samereh and this man at the time. Samereh with her choice to make, and this man, in the account that I read, was just weeping, just begging for forgiveness. And Samereh had a choice. And she chose in that moment to walk up to this man and to slap him right across the face. And that signaled her pardon. It gets better."", '12:03': 'Right afterwards, somebody asked her, they interviewed her, and she was quoted as saying, ""I felt as if rage vanished from within my heart and the blood in my veins began to flow again."" Isn\'t that incredible? I mean, what a picture of grace, what a hero of grace. And there\'s a lesson in there for all of us. That as theologian John Piper said, ""Grace is power, not just pardon."" And if you think about it, grace is the gift we give someone else in a relationship that says our relationship is way more important than the things that separate us. And if you really think about it some more, we all have the power to execute in our relationships, or to pardon.', '12:59': 'We never did find out the identity of our anonymous neighbor.', '13:03': '(Laughter)', '13:05': 'But if we did, I\'d hope we\'d simply say, ""Can we have coffee?"" And maybe there\'s somebody you need to have coffee with and find your common ground with them. Or maybe there\'s somebody you\'re in a relationship with and you need to exchange extravagant grace. Maybe go first.', '13:25': 'These two strategies have taught me how to exchange extravagant grace in my relationships and to enjoy the beautiful design of my neighbors. I want to continue to choose relationships over agonism. Will you choose to join me?', '13:44': 'Thank you.', '13:45': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But for this to happen, we need technologies that allow cars to respond faster than humans, we need algorithms that can drive better than humans and we need cameras that can see more than humans can see.', '00:24': ""For example, imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn, and there's an oncoming car or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street. Fortunately, our future car will have this superpower, a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards."", '00:42': ""For the past few years as a PhD student in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, I've been working on a camera that can do just this -- a camera that can image objects hidden around corners or blocked from direct line of sight."", '00:55': ""So let me give you an example of what our camera can see. This is an outdoor experiment we conducted where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with a laser, and the scene that we want to capture is hidden around the corner behind this curtain. So our camera system can't actually see it directly. And yet, somehow, our camera can still capture the 3D geometry of this scene."", '01:20': ""So how do we do this? The magic happens here in this camera system. You can think of this as a type of high-speed camera. Not one that operates at 1,000 frames per second, or even a million frames per second, but a trillion frames per second. So fast that it can actually capture the movement of light itself. And to give you an example of just how fast light travels, let's compare it to the speed of a fast-running comic book superhero who can move at up to three times the speed of sound. It takes a pulse of light about 3.3 billionths of a second, or 3.3 nanoseconds, to travel the distance of a meter. Well, in that same time, our superhero has moved less than the width of a human hair. That's pretty fast. But actually, we need to image much faster if we want to capture light moving at subcentimeter scales. So our camera system can capture photons at time frames of just 50 trillionths of a second, or 50 picoseconds."", '02:26': 'So we take this ultra-high-speed camera and we pair it with a laser that sends out short pulses of light. Each pulse travels to this visible wall and some light scatters back to our camera, but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner to the hidden object and back. We repeat this measurement many times to capture the arrival times of many photons from different locations on the wall. And after we capture these measurements, we can create a trillion-frame-per-second video of the wall.', '02:56': 'While this wall may look ordinary to our own eyes, at a trillion frames per second, we can see something truly incredible. We can actually see waves of light scattered back from the hidden scene and splashing against the wall. And each of these waves carries information about the hidden object that sent it. So we can take these measurements and pass them into a reconstruction algorithm to then recover the 3D geometry of this hidden scene.', '03:25': ""Now I want to show you one more example of an indoor scene that we captured, this time with a variety of different hidden objects. And these objects have different appearances, so they reflect light differently. For example, this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently than the mirror disco ball or the white discus thrower statue. And we can actually see the differences in the reflected light by visualizing it as this 3D volume, where we've just taken the video frames and stacked them together. And time here is represented as the depth dimension of this cube."", '04:00': ""These bright dots that you see are reflections of light from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball, scattering against the wall over time. The bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall, and the other streaks of light come from reflections of light from the bookcase and from the statue."", '04:22': 'Now, we can also visualize these measurements frame by frame, as a video, to directly see the scattered light. And again, here we see, first, reflections of light from the dragon, closest to the wall, followed by bright dots from the disco ball and other reflections from the bookcase. And finally, we see the reflected waves of light from the statue. These waves of light illuminating the wall are like fireworks that last for just trillionths of a second. And even though these objects reflect light differently, we can still reconstruct their shapes. And this is what you can see from around the corner.', '05:08': ""Now, I want to show you one more example that's slightly different. In this video, you see me dressed in this reflective suit and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of four times every second. The suit is reflective, so we can actually capture enough photons that we can see where I am and what I'm doing, without the camera actually directly imaging me. By capturing photons that scatter from the wall to my tracksuit, back to the wall and back to the camera, we can capture this indirect video in real time."", '05:41': 'And we think that this type of practical non-line-of-sight imaging could be useful for applications including for self-driving cars, but also for biomedical imaging, where we need to see into the tiny structures of the body. And perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots that we send to explore other planets.', '06:01': ""Now you may have heard about seeing around corners before, but what I showed you today would have been impossible just two years ago. For example, we can now image large, room-sized hidden scenes outdoors and at real-time rates, and we've made significant advancements towards making this a practical technology that you could actually see on a car someday."", '06:20': ""But of course, there's still challenges remaining. For example, can we image hidden scenes at long distances where we're collecting very, very few photons, with lasers that are low-power and that are eye-safe. Or can we create images from photons that have scattered around many more times than just a single bounce around the corner? Can we take our prototype system that's, well, currently large and bulky, and miniaturize it into something that could be useful for biomedical imaging or perhaps a sort of improved home-security system, or can we take this new imaging modality and use it for other applications? I think it's an exciting new technology and there could be other things that we haven't thought of yet to use it for."", '07:04': ""And so, well, a future with self-driving cars may seem distant to us now -- we're already developing the technologies that could make cars safer and more intelligent. And with the rapid pace of scientific discovery and innovation, you never know what new and exciting capabilities could be just around the corner."", '07:23': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

James Forbes at the dinner table of his Southern childhood, where his mother and father taught him what compassion really means day to day -- sharing with those who need love.",0:18:24,18.4,249832,2008-10-31T04:45:00+00:00,"['charter for compassion', 'compassion', 'faith', 'global issues', 'life', 'religion']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Čeština', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",James Forbes,Preacher,"{'00:05': 'Compassion: what does it look like? Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up. If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn\'t tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat, she would ask, ""Are all the children in?"" And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, ""Fix a plate"" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.', '01:01': 'Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call ""make over"" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored, all are honored.', '01:49': 'Also, we had to make a report on our extended ""visited"" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in. My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said, ""To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.""', '02:32': 'And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says, ""If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, \'Nothing.\' And if they insist, say, \'Whatever you mind to give me.\'"" This was the nature of being at that table. In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, ""Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy.""', '03:14': ""So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion. Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it. And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in? And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world."", '03:49': 'Now, it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning. Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.', '04:24': 'There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels? Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.', '05:04': 'And mom overheard us and said, ""Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That\'s what the celebration is all about. It\'s time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."" So, we sucked up. (Laughter)', '05:34': 'But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And, like Chief Seattle said, ""We did not spin the web of life. We\'re all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."" Now that\'s compassion.', '06:05': 'So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures, and something says, ""Now, that\'s compassion."" A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there\'s someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion.', '06:42': 'I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.', '07:25': 'So, there\'s another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said, ""It\'s going to be too volatile for you to go."" He insisted, ""I must go.""', '08:04': 'So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, ""I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But,"" he said, ""what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel."" And he said, ""I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."" That\'s a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.', '09:08': 'I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: ""As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."" Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.', '10:05': 'One more picture while I\'m stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, ""That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city. It was,"" he said, ""one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them. \'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.\' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other.""', '11:10': 'I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher. Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too. Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, ""Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."" So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion? How do you make it real?', '11:43': 'My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the ""Good Samaritan."" Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.', '12:26': 'The question was: ""What is the greatest commandment?"" And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, ""You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself.""', '12:43': 'And then the person asked, ""Well, what do you mean, \'neighbor?\'""', '12:49': 'And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, ""Take care of him."" And he said, ""Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return.""', '13:49': 'This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, \'a system of sustained care \' -- in the inn, take care. I think maybe it\'s one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God\'s children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, ""In regards to health, are all the children in?"" And we could say yes.', '14:32': 'Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.', '15:10': 'But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together.', '15:52': ""So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal."", '17:05': ""Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it."", '17:46': 'The song says, ♫ ""I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God\'s love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I\'m so happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ I\'m happy. Look at me. I\'m happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I\'m happy. Look at me. I\'m happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫', '18:18': ""That's compassion. (Applause)""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates the way we perceive reality. And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way. Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual experience of the world. As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is happening at all."", '00:37': 'Take the glasses I usually wear, for example. These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings. I barely notice them, even though they are constantly framing reality for me. The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing: change what we see and think but go unnoticed.', '01:00': 'Now, the only time I do notice my glasses is when something happens to draw my attention to it, like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes. So I asked myself, ""As an artist, what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media -- like news organizations, social media platforms, advertising and search engines -- are shaping our reality?"" So I created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we see the world.', '01:41': ""For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to ideas that are different from ours. We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy. So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red. It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it. It has two modes: nocebo and placebo. In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy. Whenever I see red, the red expands. It's similar to social media's amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you, you tend to stick with like-minded people and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry. Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion. Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger. In placebo mode, it's an artificial cure for this allergy. Whenever you see red, the red shrinks. It's a palliative, like in digital media. When you encounter people with different opinions, we will unfollow them, remove them completely out of our feeds. It cures this allergy by avoiding it. But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated."", '03:19': ""The device inside the helmet reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality. I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political. So what if we take a look at the last American presidential election map through the helmet?"", '03:42': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, because the mediation alters our perceptions. The allergy exists on both sides."", '03:55': ""In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced. If we are not aware of this, we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies."", '04:11': ""Our perception is not only part of our identities, but in digital media, it's also a part of the value chain. Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value. Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases, algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions, so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized to sell ads. Like, when this little red dot comes out in your notifications, it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge."", '04:53': ""So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with another project. Now, keep in mind this is conceptual. It's not a real product. It's a web browser plug-in that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore. Like the helmet, the plug-in reshapes reality, but this time, directly into the digital media itself. It shouts out the hidden filtered voices. What you should be noticing now will be bigger and vibrant, like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats."", '05:33': '(Laughter)', '05:35': 'The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm. Like, here in this comment section, there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions. The plug-in makes their comments super small.', '05:49': '(Laughter)', '05:50': 'So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation.', '06:00': '(Laughter)', '06:03': '(Applause)', '06:09': 'The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field and how much of our perception is being commoditized. Different from ad blockers, for every ad you see on the web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning.', '06:24': '(Laughter)', '06:26': 'We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality, so the next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality and show you things as they really are.', '06:39': '(Laughter)', '06:42': '(Applause)', '06:47': ""Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go. Believe me, I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product. And I created this with good intentions to train our perception and eliminate biases. But the same approach could be used with bad intentions, like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control the public narrative. It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation."", '07:20': 'So what does all this mean for us? Even though technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and going beyond it. By exploring how we interface with these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other.', '07:47': ""Technology is never neutral. It provides a context and frames reality. It's part of the problem and part of the solution. We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other."", '08:06': 'Thank you.', '08:07': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/thea_holcomb_how_peer_educators_can_transform_sex_education,How peer educators can transform sex education,"Where are teens supposed to learn about sex, asks student speaker Thea Holcomb. From alarmist imagery about sexually transmitted diseases? From the Internet and all its attendant judgment, bias and dysfunction? The answer, she suggests, lies with peer educators. In this talk, Holcomb explains why properly trained peer educators are the right people to disseminate both accurate information and healthy attitudes. As she says, ""When you get accurate, judgment-free information from your peers, you realize that sex ed doesn't have to be scary.""",,,249078,2019-02-01T23:50:22+00:00,"['sex', 'gender', 'education', 'youth', 'relationships']","['English', 'Español', 'Português brasileiro', 'Русский', 'العربية']",Thea Holcomb,Peer educator,"{'0:00': 'Greetings audience, I\'m Thea, I\'m a high school student, and today we\'re going to talk about sex. [It won\'t be too scary.] Operating on the assumption you\'re human, you\'ve certainly heard of sex. In case you haven\'t, to get you up to speed, sex is the process by which many organisms ensure their continued existence. Here\'s the thing though: sex is more complicated than that because - spoiler alert! - humans are complicated. So how do we learn about sex if it\'s so complicated? You might remember sex education like this: [Don\'t have sex; you will get PREGNANT and die.] Urban Dictionary - your source for news and information about the 21st century zeitgeist - describes sex education as:  "".. where they try to scare you out of having sex with pictures of diseased genitals..."" A more hopeful description of sex education would be something like: a lifelong process of learning about sex and sexuality, exploring values and beliefs and gaining skills to navigate relationships and manage your sexual health. This, as far as I\'m concerned, is a solid definition. So what can we do to make sex education something that teens find actually, like, educational. Clearly, teens need answers to their questions. Where do people go when they have questions? [The Internet] Listen, I love the Internet. It\'s one of the greatest developments in human information exchange. [Yes. Thanks Internet.] But what it says about sexual health is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination or is so laden with bias that it feels more like being pelted with judgement than actually receiving information. Unfortunately, not every teen is willing and able to chat it up with their parents about sex. So if not always the Internet, where can teens turn? Enter the peer educator. People my age do, indeed, talk to each other about sex. So when teens are sources of accurate information, it spreads among us quickly. As a peer educator, I belong to a program that gives me the tools to learn about everything from STIs and safe sex to contraception and consent. Basically, I can tell you more about human sexuality than the average adult. When teens see someone like me instead of someone older, they\'re quite open to the information I have to offer them. At lunch once, some friends wanted to know the difference between hormonal and copper IUDs. So I brought this to the table. Another day, my teacher didn\'t understand how emergency contraception works. So I explained it to the class. What does it look like when teens ask me questions about sexual health? It goes something like this. Venereal disease, STD, STI? This terminology, it baffles me. STI stands for sexually transmitted infection. We used to say STD, which stood for sexually transmitted disease, but it was changed recently because STI is a more medically accurate term, and taking away the big scary word ""disease"" helps decrease stigma. What the heck is trichomoniasis? Well, trichomoniasis is a STI usually spread through vaginal intercourse. It\'s curable with just one dose of an oral drug. Common symptoms, regardless of a person\'s sex, are unusual discharge, painful urination and itching. But it spreads really quickly because most of the time it\'s asymptomatic, which means people don\'t realize they have it. That\'s why it\'s so important to get tested regularly. Is it OK to be gay? Yes, all people of all identities and backgrounds, including on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, can live healthy and productive lives. Regardless of your beliefs, everyone has the right to explore and express their sexuality without the fear of shame or judgement. Thanks! So often, when my peers approach me with questions like these, seeking this or that piece of information, at least a sliver of what they\'re wondering is: ""Am I normal?"" So let\'s talk about normal. Part of the point of peer education is to give teens the opportunity to understand that there is no such thing as the elusive ""normal."" Peer educators are here to say they\'re armed with information that empowers you to make informed decisions; you are going to be OK. ""Normal"" isn\'t really necessary. When you can get accurate, judgement-free information from your peers, you realize that sex-ed doesn\'t have to be scary. So instead of striving to be normal, let\'s talk to each other. Since peer education allows sex-ed to reach the community in ways that go far beyond pictures of diseased genitals, it turns out to be pretty brilliant. An idea that, unlike trichomoniasis, is certainly worth spreading.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hailing from the West African nation of Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old soldier had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries sought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors inspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free his country from its colonial legacy.', '00:57': 'Born in 1949, Sankara was raised in a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, but like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular with the reigning government.', '01:23': 'Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies were a far cry from the sweeping changes Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara,"" Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, women, and young people. He even tried to persuade other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest.', '02:20': 'Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta.', '02:55': 'Finally in charge, Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, he renamed the country from its French colonial title ""Upper Volta"" to ""Burkina Faso,"" which translates to “Land of Upright Men."" Over the next four years he established a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military.', '03:48': 'However, Sankara’s socialist policies were met with much resistance. Many students and elites believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso from its capitalist peers. His crackdown on the misuse of public funds turned government officials against him as well. After four years, what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready to yield his power. He executed increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends against him.', '04:26': 'On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered by his friend Blaise Compaoré.', '04:41': 'Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place as an icon of revolution for his country and throughout the world.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to take you on a journey into the sea, looking at it from the perspective of its smallest inhabitants: the microbes. My goal is that after this short journey, you'll share my amazement at how deeply connected our lives are to these microscopic creatures and also perhaps my concern that these relationships are often neglected when it comes to making decisions and policies about our oceans."", '00:44': ""When you look out on a clear blue ocean, you're actually gazing at a microbial soup full of vibrant life. What you see here are marine bacteria buzzing about and exploring other members of the marine food web. To emphasize how small this world really is, I've added a white line to most of my slides that shows you the thickness of a single strand of human hair -- very tiny. An average teaspoon of clean seawater has five million bacteria and 50 million viruses in it. If I were to scoop up two gallons of seawater, there would be more bacteria in those two gallons than there are people on this planet. Take just a moment and think about how many gallons might make up an ocean. Or maybe I've already made your stomach turn, as you think of all of the seawater we've each accidentally swallowed over the years. But luckily, we rarely get sick from that seawater, because most marine microbes are working for us, not against us."", '01:45': 'One of my favorite examples is that they provide half of the oxygen we breathe. In middle school, we all learn to thank the trees. And admittedly, they may be more huggable than the microbes. But it turns out that land plants only create a quarter of the oxygen we breathe. Another quarter comes from macroalgae like kelp and a full 50% from the microbes. Take a deep breath in. Thank the trees. Take another deep breath in. Thank the macroalgae. Your next two breaths -- tip your hats to the microbes.', '02:20': 'This picture is of a bacterium that happens to be the single most abundant photosynthesizer on our planet. It\'s called, ""Prochlorococcus,"" and this is oceans\' oxygen-producing powerhouse and, I might argue, one of the most amazing discoveries of recent marine microbiology. We didn\'t know it existed until 1988. All of human history has depended on this little microbe for the oxygen they breathe every day, no matter where or when they lived. And we\'ve only been aware of that relationship for a mere 24 years. I find that astounding. How many more critical relationships are out there that we have yet to discover?', '03:00': 'I see our relationship with marine microbes as parallel in many ways to the relationship we have with microbes in our gut. We\'ve all experienced the wrath of unhappy gut microbes at one point or another, perhaps food poisoning or tainted water. But we may be less aware of the connection we have with marine microbes and the physical discomforts we can feel when those communities change. As an extreme example: the disease cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in the ocean. So while most marine microbes are indeed helping us, there do remain plenty that are not. Our relationship with the ocean, much like our gut, is dependent on the right balance of microbes. The old phrase, ""You are what you eat"" applies to our ocean microbes as well.', '03:48': ""To give you a sense of what an overfed ocean may look like, here are two examples of me sampling seawater. On your left, it's a clean coral reef, and on your right is a nearly dead coral reef that has a very intense fish farming operation in the waters there. You'll notice I'm only smiling in one of these two pictures, and in the other one my dive buddy had to be a whole lot closer to capture that image. So if we were to take a drop of seawater from each of these samples and put it under the microscope, this is what the bacteria and viral communities would look like. So again, clean reef on your left, fish farm reef on your right. As we all have had a feeling of discomfort from imbalanced gut microbes, a fish swimming through a part of the ocean that has been overfed in this way -- in this case, by intense aquaculture, but it could be a sewage spill or fertilizer runoff or any number of other sources -- that fish will feel the physical discomforts of the ocean microbes being out of whack. There may be less oxygen present, there may be more pathogens there, and there may be toxins produced by some of these microbes. The bottom line is that from their tiny-scale existence, these tiny microbes have a very large-scale power to control how our ocean smells, how it tastes, how it feels and how it looks."", '05:10': ""If you take one idea away from my talk today, let it be this: we have an incredibly important relationship with these marine microbes that have very large-scale consequences, and we're just barely beginning to understand what that relationship looks like and how it may be changing. Just as a physician will have trouble curing a disease of unknown cause, we will have similar trouble restoring ocean health without understanding the microbes better. They are the invisible engineers that control the chemistry of the ocean and therefore, what creatures can live there, whether or not it's safe for us to swim there and all of the other characteristics we sense with our eyes, noses and taste buds. And the more we pay attention to these small but very numerous members of the ocean, the more we're learning they do indeed respond to human actions, such as in this fish farm example."", '06:00': ""Now, as the past few slides about coral reefs may have suggested, I do indeed spend much of my time as a researcher thinking about human-microbe interactions, specifically on coral reefs. It turns out, we're not alone in having our own protective community of microbes. Corals, along with most other organisms on this planet, have their own protective communities as well. However, rather than keeping theirs on the inside as we do in our gut, they keep theirs on the outside, to protect them from their surroundings So what you're seeing here is a three-dimensional image of a live spot on a living coral with all of its living bacteria, that I took with some exciting technology -- a high-speed laser-scanning confocal microscope. All of the red circles are the symbiotic algae that live inside the coral tissue, turning sunlight and into sugars they both can use, and all of the little blue dots are the protective bacteria. So when I use image analysis software to highlight the outer layer of the coral in white, you can see that there are still some tiny little blue dots above that layer. And those bacteria are sitting in a mucus layer, which is also part of the coral's protective layer."", '07:15': ""From the bigger perspective, I spend my time thinking about these relationships, because too many reefs are going from looking like the picture on your left to the picture on your right. Believe it or not, the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist snorkeling spot on the island of Maui, even though it's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so. Corals are getting sick all around the globe at alarming rates, and we really don't know how or why. I see the microbes on the coral reefs, both the good ones and the bad ones, trying to link their micro-scale behaviors to this big picture of: How do we help the reef that looks like the right back towards something that looks more like the left? Or: How do we stop coral disease from spreading?"", '07:59': ""Just over a year ago, no one had ever seen a view like this. This video is a prime example of making the invisible visible. We're looking at a side view of the same coral as before, where the protective layer meets the seawater; so, seawater on your right, coral on your left. It's incredibly exciting to me that we can finally see these bacteria in real life, in real time, at their micro scale, and learn how they interact with the world around them. Ecologists all over the world are used to being able to grab a pair of binoculars and go out and observe what their study creatures do each day. But microbial ecologists have desperately needed breakthroughs in technology, such as with this fast confocal, to make similar observations. I work to find ways that cutting-edge technologies like this can help make the unseen seeable, to see marine bacteria in action and learn how they behave. In doing so, we can learn how they respond to our actions and our behaviors and the environment around them in ways that will help us better manage our oceans."", '09:04': ""Another example of how I'm doing this is by using microfluidics to study specifically how pathogens behave in the ocean. The basic idea behind microfluidics is that you can use nanofabrication techniques to recreate or mimic the conditions bacteria experience at their own tiny scale in the ocean. What you see here is a microfluidic chamber on a microscope slide with a microscope lens underneath it. We use high-speed video microscopy to record bacteria behavior. The colored tubing is where bacteria and seawater flow in and out of the device. And it's using a device like this that I recently discovered that a known coral pathogen actually has the ability to sniff around the seawater and hunt for corals. Here's the video of in action. You'll see all of the pathogens which are the tiny green dots on the left start detecting the coral mucus I put on the right side of the channel, and they swim quickly over in that direction and stay there. Up until now, it was thought that a pathogen would need some good luck to find its host in the ocean. But simply by watching and observing, we can learn that these bacteria are very well adapted to seeking out their victims."", '10:25': ""These micro-channels are bringing us closer than ever before to understanding how bacteria navigate that big blue ocean. It turns out that this pathogen can even detect the coral mucus when I dilute it 20,000 fold. So these bacteria are very well adapted to hunting down these corals. I'm currently testing different environmental conditions to see what scenarios make this pathogen more or less capable of hunting corals. By learning more about what triggers the hunt, we should be able to find ways to help slow down or prevent this disease. There's also some evidence that the healthy microbes on the coral can fight off the pathogen if the conditions are right."", '11:14': ""So, one final image of a coral and its healthy bacteria. I hope you've enjoyed this short journey into our microbial oceans and that the next time you look out at the sea, you'll take in a deep breath of fresh ocean air and wonder: What else are all of the unseen microbes doing to keep us and our oceans healthy?"", '11:32': 'Thank you.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Songs that sing of sorrow, of grief, of longing, of the darker side of love, the underside of being alive, these are the songs I just never tire of hearing and I never tire of writing, because they make me feel less alone. They speak to a very real part of being human that can often be hidden in fear and shame and pushed deep down where it lingers and rots."", '04:38': ""But I think in listening to these songs -- really listening -- can allow us to refeel these hard emotions, but in a cathartic and healing way.

The cherry blossom in and of itself is no more impressive than that of an apple or orange tree, but what sets it apart is its brevity. Cherry blossoms fall within a single week -- can be whisked away on the gentlest breeze -- and it\'s this that makes it more beautiful.

At first glance, this painting may appear to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter and sculptor. But the magic behind this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself.', '00:45': 'Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little personal connection to it.', '01:10': 'After moving to New York, she was increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color.', '01:33': 'These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching, any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings.', '02:05': 'Experiments like these would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement called American Modernism. Although no single style defines Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, Modernist painting often used geometric shapes and bold colors to probe the American psyche.', '02:29': 'O’Keeffe threw herself into these experiments — but she was reluctant to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead to marriage in 1924.', '02:52': 'Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint for months at a time. Whether she was exploring the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention to small details, and spent hours mixing paints to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue, she’d record it in her ever-growing collection of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In ""Rams Head with Hollyhock,"" she places a weathered skull and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows the landscape, casting both the skeleton and the mountains in a new, eerie light.', '03:46': 'The public was captivated by her unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed such interpretations. She resented the male gaze that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation of the natural world.', '04:15': 'Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating until her death at 98, and is remembered as the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains its wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jamais Cascio looks at some specific tools and techniques that can make a difference. It's a fascinating talk that might just inspire you to act.,0:16:03,16.05,240275,2009-01-21T01:00:00+00:00,"['culture', 'future', 'global issues', 'social change', 'technology']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Jamais Cascio,World-builder,"{'00:04': ""The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of. I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job. I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com. Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003, and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there, right now and on the near horizon."", '00:34': ""In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items -- replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas -- all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable. Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.  There are tons of places to go, online and off, if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving. We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. We focus primarily on the planet's environment, but we also address issues of global development, international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies, even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower and much, much more."", '01:26': ""The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad, but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so. A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface, but to give you a sense of what we cover: tools for rapid disaster relief, such as this inflatable concrete shelter; innovative uses of bioscience, such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines; ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices; distributed power generation using solar power, wind power, ocean power, other clean energy sources; ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future; ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now; and better urban design,  so you don't need to drive as much in the first place;  bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging: cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs, the consequences of extreme longevity, the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder."", '02:37': 'As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er, hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday, I\'m naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me, much to my own surprise, that successful responses to the world\'s problems are nonetheless possible. Moreover, I\'ve come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success. As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed, ""Pessimism is a luxury of good times ... In difficult times, pessimism is a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."" The truth is, we can build a better world, and we can do so right now. We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago, and we\'re coming up with new ones all the time. We have the knowledge, and our understanding of the planet improves every day. Most importantly, we have the motive: we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody\'s going to do it for us.', '03:39': 'Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common: transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment, and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science! (Laughter) The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world-changing ways.', '04:10': ""We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible -- that is, to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible. We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions. As a small example, many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency. The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily. Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding, can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion. Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions, or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps, allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all."", '05:29': ""We can see world-changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action. Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers, but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions are far more important. For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science, make cutting-edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world. And actually, a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model. Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. That genome data can now be found on open-access genetic data banks around the world, and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments. But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus. The U.S. National Research Council in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly."", '06:49': ""And we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone -- and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't? (Laughter) For many of us, cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves, and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. You may already know some of the big-picture aspects: globally, more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera, and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens, and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books. In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers. A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa. In Kenya, mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency. The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press. (Laughter)"", '07:56': ""And it's just going to get more wild. Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video, even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket, will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate. It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies. And in this rapidly evolving context, it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction."", '08:22': ""I've long admired the Witness project, and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday, in his profoundly moving presentation. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand-carrying the videotape. Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses, it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation."", '08:54': 'Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists. Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what\'s happening to the planet: putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds, from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures. It would highlight the changes that are underway, but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world, a better world, come about. It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet. It would be, in essence, an ""Earth Witness"" project. Now, just to be clear, in this talk I\'m using the name ""Earth Witness"" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. It could just as easily be called, ""Environmental Transparency Project,"" ""Smart Mobs for Natural Security"" -- but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.', '09:53': ""Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise, especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions. That's understandable and important. We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.  In the best Worldchanging tradition, it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility. Earth Witness would show us two worlds: the world we're leaving behind, and the world we're building for generations to come."", '10:34': ""And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today. The key components are already widely available. Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project. And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet to always-on, widely available information tools. We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones. You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones. Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. At the other end of the network, there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to, accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service, social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system. Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly. That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more."", '11:55': ""An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone. Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine, using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution. It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person. Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new: phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath, or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure. Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results. Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs."", '12:58': ""Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels, the presence of some biotoxins -- potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus. You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project. Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis. And that's worth noting in particular.  The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal. Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps, from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world."", '13:54': ""It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed. We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone. It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up. And most important, you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth. This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data. And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters. A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us  to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately, the improvement of the planet itself."", '14:51': ""Now, as I suggested at the outset, there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there, so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist? Because this is what tomorrow could look like: bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other. Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves. We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models, powerful tools, and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future. We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all; we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. There's a staggering array of wonders out there, across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing: success can be ours if we're willing to try. And as we say at Worldchanging, another world isn't just possible; another world is here. We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That\'s sort of an interesting enough topic to me. And the reason was, because when I was asked to do this, I\'d just read in one of the papers, I can\'t remember, something from someone at Facebook saying, ""Well, we need to make everybody use their real names, and then that\'s basically all the problems solved."" And that\'s so wrong, that\'s such a fundamentally reactionary view of identity, and it\'s going to get us into all sorts of trouble. And so what I thought I\'d do is, I\'ll explain four sort of problems about it, and then I\'ll suggest a solution, which, hopefully, you might find interesting.', '00:42': 'So just to frame the problem: What does ""authenticity"" mean? That\'s me, that\'s a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting.', '00:52': ""[What's the Problem?]"", '00:53': ""That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger, and because I'm not very good at presentations, I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card. And he was incarcerated in, I think, Wakefield Prison, for forging masterpieces by, I think, French Impressionists. And he's so good at it that when he was in prison, everybody in prison, the governor and whatever, wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls because they were so good. And so that's a masterpiece, which is a fake of a masterpiece, and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake, if you see what I mean."", '01:28': '(Laughter)', '01:29': ""So when we're talking about authenticity, it's a little more fractal than it appears, and that's a good example to show it. I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly."", '01:41': 'So the first problem, I thought, chip and PIN, right?', '01:44': '[Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within]', '01:47': '[Offline solutions do not work online]', '01:49': ""Everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right? So why is that a good example? That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well-constructed system. That chip-and-PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop, is extremely secure, you can put scanning electron microscopes on it, you can try and grind it down, blah blah blah. Those chips have never been broken, whatever you read in the paper. And for a joke, we take that supersecure chip, and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe. And for very lazy criminals, we still emboss the card. So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card, you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to speed things up. And even more amusingly, and on my debit card, too, we print the name and the sort code and everything else on the front. Why? There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip-and-PIN card. And if you think about it, it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first. Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals. You know what your name is, right?"", '02:55': '(Laughter)', '02:56': 'And when you go into a shop and buy something, it\'s a PIN -- he doesn\'t care what the name is. The only place you ever have to write your name on the back is in America. Whenever I go to America, and I have to pay with a magstripe on the back of the card, I always sign it ""Carlos Tethers"" anyway, just as a security mechanism, because if a transaction ever gets disputed, and it comes back and it says ""Dave Birch,"" I know it must have been a criminal, because I would never sign it ""Dave Birch.""', '03:21': '(Laughter)', '03:22': ""So if you drop your card in the street, it means a criminal can pick it up and read it. They know the name, from the name, they can find the address, and then they can go off and buy stuff online. Why do we put the name on the card? Because we think identity is something to do with names, and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card, which obsesses us. And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago, but if you're someone in politics or the Home Office or whatever, and you think about identity, you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on. And that's very subversive in a modern world."", '03:56': ""So the second example I thought I'd use is chat rooms."", '04:01': '[Chatrooms and Children]', '04:02': ""I'm very proud of that picture. That's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig, I believe you call it, where he got paid."", '04:10': '(Laughter)', '04:11': ""And I love that picture. I'll like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better,"", '04:16': '(Laughter)', '04:17': 'I like that one for the moment. Why do I use that picture? Because that was very interesting, watching that experience as an old person.', '04:24': 'So him and his friends, they get together, they booked a room, like a church hall, and they got all their friends who had bands, got them together, and they do it all on Facebook, and then they sell tickets, and the first band on the -- I was going to say ""menu,"" that\'s probably the wrong word for it, isn\'t it? The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first 20 tickets, then the next band gets the next 20, and so on. They were at the bottom of the menu, like, fifth, I thought they had no chance. He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right? But my point is, that all worked perfectly, except on the web.', '05:02': 'So they\'re sitting on Facebook, and they\'re sending these messages and arranging things, and they don\'t know who anybody is, right? That\'s the problem we\'re trying to solve. If only they were using real names, then you wouldn\'t be worried about them on the internet. So when he says to me, ""Oh, I want to go to a chat room to talk about guitars"" or something, I\'m like, ""Oh, well, I don\'t want you to go into a chat room to talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends, and some of the people that are in the chat room might be, you know, perverts and teachers and vicars --""', '05:34': '(Laughter)', '05:35': 'I mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right? ""So I want to know who all the people in the chat room are. So, OK, you can go in the chat room, but only if everybody in the chat room is using their real names, and they submit full copies of their police report.""', '05:50': '(Laughter)', '05:51': 'But of course, if anybody in the chat room asked for his real name, I\'d say, ""No. You can\'t give them your real name, because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever?""', '06:01': ""So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is, but I don't want anybody else to know who he is. And so you get this sort of logjam around identity, where you want full disclosure from everybody else, but not from yourself. And there's no progress, we get stuck. So the chat room thing doesn't work properly, and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity."", '06:23': 'Cheerleading ... so, on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about -- I just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn\'t I? I should stop saying it like that. For some random reason I can\'t imagine, something about cheerleaders turned up in my in-box. And I read this story about cheerleaders, and it\'s a fascinating story. This happened a couple of years ago in the US. There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the US, and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach, as I\'m sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time, and somehow, the cheerleading coach found out about this. She was very upset. So she went to one of the girls and said, ""You have to give me your Facebook password."" I read this all the time, where even at some universities and places of education, kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords. So you have to give them your Facebook password. So the kid -- she was a kid! -- what she should have said is, ""My lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning. It\'s an outrageous imposition on my Fourth Amendment right to privacy. You\'ll be sued for all the money you\'ve got!"" That\'s what she should have said. But she\'s a kid, so she hands over the password. The teacher can\'t log in, because the school has blocked access to Facebook. So the teacher can\'t log into Facebook till she gets home. So the girl tells her friends, ""Guess what happened? The teacher logged in. She knows."" So the girls all logged into Facebook and deleted their profiles. So when the teacher logged in, there was nothing there. My point is: those identities, they don\'t think about them the same way.', '07:43': ""Identity is -- especially when you're a teenager -- a fluid thing. You have lots of identities, you experiment with them. And if you have an identity you don't like because it's subverted in some way or it's insecure or it's inappropriate, you just delete it and get another one. The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone, the government or whatever, and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places is absolutely wrong. Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook, unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way? It just doesn't work properly."", '08:14': 'And my fourth example is, there are some cases where you really want to be -- in case you\'re wondering, that\'s me at the G20 protest. I wasn\'t actually at the G20 protest, but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G20 protest. And I got an email from the bank, saying, ""Please don\'t wear a suit, because it\'ll inflame the protesters."" I look pretty good in a suit, frankly, so you can see why it would drive them into an anticapitalist frenzy.', '08:39': '(Laughter)', '08:40': 'So I thought, ""Well, if I don\'t want to inflame the protesters, the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester."" So I went dressed completely in black, you know, black balaclava ... I had black gloves on but took them off to sign the visitors\' book.', '08:52': '(Laughter)', '08:53': 'I\'m wearing black trousers and boots, I\'m dressed completely in black. I go into the bank at 10am and go, ""Hi, I\'m Dave Birch, I\'ve got a 3 o\'clock with so-and-so."" ""Sure!"" And they sign me in. There\'s my visitor\'s badge.', '09:04': '(Laughter)', '09:05': 'So this nonsense about ""you\'ve got to have real names on Facebook"" and whatever, that gets you that kind of security. That gets you ""security theater,"" where there\'s no actual security, but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security, and as long as everybody learns their lines, everyone\'s happy. But it\'s not real security, right? Especially because I hate banks more than the G20 protesters do, because I work for them. I know that things are actually worse than these guys think.', '09:31': '(Laughter)', '09:34': 'But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something -- you know, they were like people who take the money from banks and don\'t ... you know, they take the money ... Oh -- ""traders."" That\'s the word I was thinking of. Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader, and I want to report it to the boss of the bank. So I log on to do a little whistleblowing. I send a message, ""This guy\'s a rogue trader."" That message is meaningless if you don\'t know that I\'m a trader at the bank. If that message just comes from anybody, it has zero information value. There\'s no point in sending that message. You have to know that I\'m ... But if I have to prove who I am, I\'ll never send that message. It\'s just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. That message will only happen if I\'m anonymous. So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity in it, otherwise, we don\'t get where we want to get to.', '10:29': 'So, four issues. So what are we going to do about it? Well, what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell-space. And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in 1953. So we think if we had a card -- call it a Facebook login -- which proves who you are, and I make you carry it all the time, that solves the problem. And of course, for all those reasons I\'ve just outlined, it doesn\'t, and it might make some problems worse. The more times you\'re forced to use your real identity, certainly in transactional terms, the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted. The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don\'t need identity, which is actually almost all transactions. Almost all of the transactions you do are not ""Who are you?"" They\'re ""Are you allowed to drive the car?"" ""Are you allowed in the building?"" ""Are you over 18?"" etcetera, etcetera. So my suggestion -- I, like James, think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R and D.', '11:27': ""I think this is a solvable problem. It's something we can do about. Naturally, in these circumstances, I turn to Doctor Who. Because in this --"", '11:34': '(Laughter)', '11:35': 'as in so many other walks of life, Doctor Who has already shown us the answer. So I should say, for some of our foreign visitors: Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England --', '11:46': '(Laughter)', '11:48': 'and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us. And this is Doctor Who with his ""psychic paper."" Come on, you guys must have seen Doctor Who\'s ""psychic paper."" You\'re not nerds if you say yes. Who\'s seen Doctor Who\'s psychic paper? Oh right, you were in the library the whole time studying, I guess. Is that what you\'re going to tell us? Doctor Who\'s psychic paper is: when you hold up the psychic paper, the person, in their brain, sees the thing that they need to see. So I want to show you a British passport, I hold up the psychic paper, you see a British passport. I want to get into a party, I hold up the psychic paper, I show you a party invitation. You see what you want to see. So what I\'m saying is, we need to make an electronic version of that, but with one tiny, tiny change, which is that it\'ll only show you the British passport if I\'ve actually got one. It\'ll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one. It will only show you that I\'m over 18 if I actually am over 18. But nothing else. So you\'re the bouncer at the pub, you need to know that I\'m over 18. Instead of showing you my driving license, which shows you I know how to drive, what my name is, my address, all these kind of things, I show you my psychic paper, and all it tells you is, am I over 18 or not. Right.', '12:59': ""Is that just a pipe dream? Of course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking. So, in order to build that and make it work, I'm only going to name these things, I'll not go into them: we need a plan, which is, we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use to solve all of these problems. We're going to make a utility. The utility has to be universal, you can use it everywhere. I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along."", '13:23': 'That\'s a Japanese ATM, the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone. So when you want to draw money out, you put the phone on the ATM and touch your finger, your fingerprint goes through to the phone, the phone says, ""Yes, that\'s whoever,"" and the ATM then gives you some money. It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere. It has to be absolutely convenient.', '13:41': ""That's me going into the pub. All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is: Is this person over 18 and not barred from the pub? And so the idea is, you touch your ID card to the door, and if I'm allowed in, it shows my picture, if I'm not, it shows a red cross. It doesn't disclose any other information. It has to have no special gadgets. That can only mean one thing, following on from Ross's statement, which I agree with completely: if it means no special gadgets, it has to run on a mobile phone. That's the only choice we have, to make it work on mobile phones. There are 6.6 billion mobile phone subscriptions. My favorite statistic of all time: only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world. That means something. I don't know what."", '14:20': '(Laughter)', '14:21': ""I rely on our futurologists to tell me. It has to be a utility which is extensible. So it has to be something that anybody could build on. Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure; you don't need permissions, licenses, whatever. Anyone should be able to write some code to do this."", '14:37': ""Well, you know what symmetry is, so you don't need a picture of it. This is how we're going to do it. We're going to do it using phones and mobile proximity. I'm going to suggest to you the technology to implement Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here, and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it, you've already got that technology. Have you ever been up to the big city and used an Oyster card? Does that ring a bell? The technology already exists. The first phones that have the technology built in -- the Google Nexus, the S II, the Samsung Wave 578 -- the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops. So the idea that the gasman can turn up at my mum's door, and he can show my mum his phone, and she can tap it with her phone, and it'll come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in, and will come up with red if he isn't, end of story."", '15:25': ""We have the technology to do that. And what's more, although some of those things sound a bit counterintuitive, like proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am, the cryptography to do that not only exists, it's extremely well-known and well-understood. Digital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates -- these technologies have been around for a while, we've just had no way of packaging them up. So the technology already exists. We know it works. There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places. That's London Fashion Week, where we built a system with O2. That's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park. You can see the person's walking in with their VIP band, it's being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic, this stuff works in these environments. They don't need to be special."", '16:11': ""So finally, I know that you can do this, because if you saw the Easter special of Doctor Who, where he went to Mars in a bus -- I should say, again, for our foreign students: that doesn't happen in every episode. This was a very special case. So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus -- I can't show you the clip, due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright by the BBC -- but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus, Doctor Who is clearly shown getting onto the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper. Which proves that psychic paper has an NFC interface."", '16:52': 'Thank you very much.', '16:53': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is from this wonderful piece Mr. Ailey created in 1960, called ""Revelations."" Mr. Ailey was 29 years old when he choreographed this masterpiece. It\'s been danced all over the world and understood universally, because he understood the humanity in us all. ""Revelations"" is a reflection of a journey we all take in life, and, hopefully, triumphantly.', '04:06': 'That was the magic of Alvin Ailey. He was able to see you, in the audience, see me, as the dancer, and see the connection between us, and choreographed works that connected us all. So you felt he was telling your story, while I felt I was dancing mine.', '04:26': 'I started dancing when I was six years old in Philadelphia. I was skinny ...', '04:32': '(Laughter)', '04:35': 'Dark chocolate, and a kid with legs up to my armpits. And the very first performance I had, at the Judimar School of Dance, was in a red checkered shirt, dungarees, pink ballet shoes, and we were dancing to ""I\'m an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande."" I loved every minute of it. I mean, I literally did love every minute of it, especially when I heard the applause, and I knew right there, when I was six, I said, ""That\'s for me.""', '05:09': '(Laughter)', '05:11': 'At six, you\'re not thinking that\'s going to be a career of your lifetime, but that was perfect for that moment. I danced my way through school, and through college, and it still didn\'t dawn on me that that\'s what I actually wanted to do. I went to an audition, which I was dreadful in -- it\'s the only audition I\'ve had in my life -- and when I was let go from that audition -- because I thought when they were saying, ""Thank you very much,"" that meant for me to stay.', '05:36': '(Laughter)', '05:39': ""I ran up the steps, and there was a man sitting on the steps. And I barely noticed him. He was an observer. Three days later, that man called me and asked me, would I like to join the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. That's how it happened, folks, that's it. There's no drama or trauma."", '05:57': '(Applause)', '06:00': 'So I spent 15 years dancing with the company, and then I directed it for something like 21 years.', '06:06': ""If you were black and African American and a dancer, any time between the '40s and the '70s, you had much to say, because your complete voice was not being heard. And you were not being represented as you truly were. Alvin Ailey had the courage, right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, to present the truth about who we were -- that our creativity, our beauty, our intelligence, our talents were an intrinsic part of the panoply of American culture."", '06:38': ""Our mantra has always been to educate, to entertain, and to lift our audiences. Mr. Ailey believed that dance came from the people and needed to be delivered back to the people. We didn't dance in a vacuum. It was our mission to serve people. We call it outreach now, but it's always been a part of who we were and still are, 60 years later, to this day. Being inclusive of our audiences -- it's always been an important part of the company."", '07:15': ""We ask ourselves, who are we dancing for? Why are we dancing, if not to show people what it is to be human and to connect with the audiences that we dance for. We've always felt responsible to make sure the community understood that what we do is a part of their heritage. We just don't do this, also, in America, we do it all over the world. We tour more than any other dance company in the world."", '07:44': 'After Nelson Mandela was released from prison, I thought, well, this is the time to go to South Africa. And that was some outreach. We went to Johannesburg, Soweto, and some other townships that were really in dire straits. And it dawned on me, as we were there, I\'m going like, ""Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa, and we\'re trying to teach these people how to dance?""', '08:09': '(Laughter)', '08:10': ""But it was our African Americanness that they were interested in, and the culture that we had developed over the last 400 years. We toured all over the world many times, and whether we're in Europe or South America or Asia or somewhere else, audiences are thrilled and excited. You sounded thrilled and excited. Sometimes with tears in their eyes, because this nonverbal communication really works. And it's about embracing everyone."", '08:43': ""Alvin didn't need to explain to us what was going on at the time in the '60s and the '70s; it was obvious why were doing his work. He knew what the truth of the time was about, and he was unafraid to reveal it through dance. He tapped into every emotion he had and we had, and from angerness to happiness, to grief and everything in between, he knew us. He took our history and turned it into powerful dance."", '09:15': ""He and I overlapped generationally. We didn't have to talk about things so much, because we understood implicitly our shared responsibilities. So when he asked me to take over the company before he passed in 1989, I felt prepared to carry it forward. Alvin and I were like parts of the same tree. He, the roots and the trunk, and we were the branches. I was his muse. We were all his muses."", '09:49': 'The ballet ""Cry,"" which some of you might have seen -- you\'re going to see an excerpt of it -- it was made on me, and Alvin dedicated it to all black women, especially our mothers. When Alvin and I went in the studio, of course he wasn\'t thinking, ""Here I am, creating an iconic work."" Do you know any artist that does that? You don\'t go into the studio to create anything but what\'s coming truthfully from your heart and your spirit. And you trust that you have a dancer you can share that with. Rehearsal space is a sacred space, not to be intruded upon, because it\'s about talking to each other through spirit. You better have some technique on top of that so you can do the dance.', '10:36': '(Laughter)', '10:37': 'He brought his Alvin to ""Cry"" and I brought my Judy to it. I just did the steps. And this was a birthday present for his mother, because he couldn\'t afford to get her a tactile gift.', '10:49': ""When I performed it the first time, it was physically and emotionally draining. I hadn't yet run through the whole piece from beginning to end. The ballet is 16 minutes long. It's about a proud woman who has been to hell and back, from her journey across the Atlantic. She's exhausted, she's a queen, and in this section, you're going to see she is triumphant. She made it, and she is, in that last step that she does, beating away anything negative with her tremendous strength. And in the last step, she digs into the earth and she reaches into the sky ... because she's clearing space for the next journey. I performed it in 1971, and we are still clearing space."", '11:55': ""Now let me leave you with one last thought. Here we are, in the 21st century, still fighting for civil rights. Not a day goes by that we are not made aware of the struggle that continues. I believe that dance can elevate our human experience beyond words. And when you're sitting in the dark, in the theater, having a personal experience, you don't feel blocked or misunderstood. You feel open, alive, and, we hope, inspired."", '12:40': 'Thank you.', '12:42': '(Applause)', '12:49': '(Music: ""Right on.

https://www.ted.com/talks/gareth_gaskell_how_do_our_brains_process_speech,How do our brains process speech?,"The average 20-year-old knows between 27,000 and 52,000 different words.

By age 60, that number averages between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words last less than a second. So with every word, the brain has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses the correct word.', '00:42': 'But how? Speech comprehension is different from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language comprehension— though spoken word recognition has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability to understand speech is the brain’s role as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple different things at the same time. Most theories assume that each word we know is represented by a separate processing unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming speech matching that particular word.', '01:16': 'In the context of the brain, the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units may become active, because with just the beginning of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, more and more units register that some vital piece of information is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, corresponding to one word. This is called the ""recognition point."" In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend up to about 8 syllables per second.', '02:09': 'Yet, the goal is not only to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show that even upon hearing a word fragment— like ""cap""— listeners will start to register multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital, before the full word emerges.', '02:37': 'This suggests that every time we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, like ""bat,"" or ""crane,"" or in cases of homophones like ""no"" or ""know."" For multilingual people, the language they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words that don’t match the language context.', '03:18': 'So, what about adding completely new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across a new word every few days. But if every word is represented as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons with others words.', '03:52': 'Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words.', '04:07': 'So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions of meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was first asked to do a TED Talk, I Googled to try and find out a little bit more about, you know, how it felt to be giving one. And one of the first things I read was a speaker in the States saying that she felt fine until she came onstage, and then she saw the timer ticking down.', '00:27': '(Laughter)', '00:28': 'And it reminded her of a bomb. I was thinking, ""That\'s the last thing I need.""', '00:33': '(Laughter)', '00:35': '(Applause)', '00:40': ""Anyway, it's a great privilege to be here. I think it's a bit of a joke for an editor of a paper to choose a photographer to open a speaking event."", '00:48': '(Laughter)', '00:49': ""We're not renowned for our words, and I spent the last 40 years hiding behind a camera so I didn't have to speak. But I'm here today, and what I want to talk about are stories and the importance of stories to me and, I think, the importance of stories to everybody. I'm sure today you'll hear a lot of stories and, by listening to other people's stories, I think we can learn about the world, about other people and get a better understanding. So I want to talk about three stories that I've done as a photographer, and how they've inspired me, and how, in my life, I've become a part of the stories that I document myself."", '01:24': ""As John said, I was a fashion photographer and music photographer for 10 years. I enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun, but always wanted to do something more with my work. And storytelling was always something I wanted to do. So 10 years ago, I set out to travel the world, to go and photograph other people in their situations and to record their stories, to bring them back, so that other people might understand. But this didn't happen overnight. When I worked as a music photographer and a fashion photographer, I always had this nagging feeling that there was something missing, that I wasn't quite using my skills productively. And it may seem very obvious, the link, now, but at the time, I couldn't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful. So I gave up photography. I walked away from it completely and decided to do care work."", '02:14': ""As a care worker, I started looking after a young guy called Nick. Nick has autism, very severe autism. But over the years of looking after him, we became very close friends. I would give him a 24-hour care, we would go off and do things from swimming, going for walks ... all sorts. Bit by bit, though, as I got to know him better, I realized that his story wasn't being told. He self-harmed, he would punch himself quite a lot in the face. And nobody really got to see that. So this is Nick. He used to describe his life as living downstairs at a party. He said he could hear the party in the kitchen, but he felt like he was always trapped in the basement, in his own little world, wanting to be part of the party but not able to walk upstairs. So I documented his life. I started to photograph it, not really with any intention of doing anything with the pictures, but just as a way of recording."", '03:15': ""And as I started doing that, I realized that I could tell somebody's story through my photographs. As I said, Nick would self-harm. He would punch himself in the face. And nobody really got to see that. As we built up a kind of closer friendship, he finally would allow me to actually see him doing this and to document it. It was a moment of trust. The social services were not particularly good at helping Nick, and they said that he wouldn't be self-harming as bad as we said."", '03:53': ""So one day, I took a photograph of when he'd really been self-harming. We took that to the social services, and their reaction was immediately incredibly different, and they managed to get a lot of help. And I'm glad to say now, eight years later, I actually spoke to Nick last night, and he wanted to let me know that he was feeling a lot better, and he doesn't do the self-harming anymore. And in some small way, I hope that the photographs was a part of that process. The main thing it did is it inspired me to go out with my camera and to tell other people's stories."", '04:28': 'One of the stories I did was in Kutupalong, on the border of Burma and Bangladesh. Here, the Rohingyas refugees have been left, pretty much to rot, for over 20 years. This is a picture of the unofficial camp. At the top, you can see the official UN camp. All these huts are the unofficial camps. Literally, the raw sewage runs through the camp. The people there have been forgotten, so I thought it was important to go and document their stories. So I arranged with the village elder; the people would come along the next day, and I would take portraits of all these people and record their stories. So as the time went on, I turned up in the morning, I put a big, white sheet up, and I started to photograph these people.', '05:18': 'Suddenly, though, everything got a bit out of control, and, although it was still dawn, we were filled in this small little compound we had made with literally hundreds of people turning up with ailments and diseases and just ... a hopeless situation. And that\'s exactly what their situation is -- helpless. A child with a tumor that nobody helped, who was slowly suffocating. I got in a bit of a panic, because these people were coming up to me, desperate, and I was trying to explain to the village elder that I was not a doctor, and I couldn\'t help these people. And the village elder turned to me and he said, ""No, it\'s really important; these people know you\'re not a doctor, but at least somebody is now telling their story, and somebody is recording what is happening to them."" And it was a good moment for me. It was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things.', '06:14': 'Another story that inspired me was in Odessa, in Ukraine. I was documenting a bunch of street kids. I ended up actually living with them in a squat, which I can say was an experience. Many late nights of vodka-fueled violence with me sitting in the corner with my bag, just going, ""When was this a good idea?""', '06:34': '(Laughter)', '06:35': 'I would say it\'s moments like that when I think, ""Why did I leave the fashion world?""', '06:40': 'But they were great kids, and on the last day, they took me down to the sea for a sort of trip, a sort of farewell. There they are, drinking vodka. And then Serge, who was the oldest and the most violent -- he\'d just got out of the prison for stabbing somebody -- comes and puts his arm around me and says, ""We go swimming."" Now, I have to say, I had a ""Lonely Planet"" guide to Ukraine and in it, it gave some advice. And in that advice was, ""Do not talk to the street kids, at no point leave your baggage unattended and in all counts, do not go swimming.""', '07:15': '(Laughter)', '07:17': 'So I was like, ""I don\'t know if this is a good idea."" Serge has got his arm around me. I\'m like, ""OK."" So there I am.', '07:25': '(Laughter)', '07:26': 'I literally handed all my cameras, all my equipment, to these street kids. And they took it. It\'s kind of funny to know, if you look in the background, you can see the other street kids who didn\'t get in the water go, ""Why would you get in that water?""', '07:39': ""But one of the little kids, Lilic, he was the one who had taken my camera, and he started taking photographs. He was really excited by this camera. And we talked a lot about how I was going to get him a camera and would return and we could start to teach him photography. He had a real eye for things. That's him, there. That was taken on the last evening I was there. I'd been staying there, but that night, I left to go and collect my things. And when I came back in the morning, he was dead. He had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vodka. And he had passed out in the night and didn’t recover. Again, it was another reminder of maybe why I should record these people's stories: because their lives are important, and it's important for me to document them."", '08:22': ""Then in February of last year, when I was on patrol in Afghanistan, I stepped on an IED. That's me down there, somewhere. I became part of the story. At first, I was devastated by what had happened, obviously. I thought my work was over, I thought -- everything didn't make sense to me. And then I realized: I never set out to Congo, to Angola, to Bangladesh to take photographs. I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change, and photography happened to be my tool."", '08:59': ""And then I became aware that my body was, in many ways, a living example of what war does to somebody. And I realized I could use my own experience, my own body, to tell that story. And it was also by looking back at the other people I've documented. I thought of Nick, and I thought of his resilience. I thought of the Rohingyas and the fact that they have no hope. I thought of Lilic and a lost life. And in fact, it was the stories that I've documented that inspired me to get through the last year, to survive, to get back up on my new legs and to be able to come and tell their stories, but also my own story."", '09:41': ""So I did a self-portrait, because I wanted to show everybody what a bomb does to somebody, but also to show that losing your limbs doesn't end your life; that you can have what people say is disability, but not be disabled; that you can be able to do anything if you put your mind to it and have belief in it. It's strange, but in many ways I look at where I was a year ago, and I look at where I am now, and I realize that I have a lot of things I didn't have then. I wouldn't be sitting here right now if this hadn't happened. I wouldn't have been able to show you those photographs and tell you those stories. I was lucky 10 years ago, when I sat down and I tried to work out what I could do to make a difference in this world. I realized that my photography was a tool and a way to do it."", '10:27': 'I think that\'s what\'s really key. It\'s that we all can be part of that wheel. We can all be cogs in a wheel of change. We can all make a difference. Everybody here has an ability to use something to make a difference to the world. We can all sit in front of the TV and go, ""I don\'t know what to do about it,"" and forget about it. But the reality is that we can all do something. It might be just writing a letter. It might be standing on a soapbox and talking. It might be just recording somebody\'s story and telling it to somebody else. But every single one of us here, if we want to make a difference, we can, an there is nothing to stop us. And we all have our own experiences that we can use as well.', '11:07': ""So really, that's all I wanted to talk about today. I just wanted to say that life goes on all around the world. People are going through terrible things. Everyone of us is going through our own terrible experience. But if we share those and we talk about stories, then we can inspire each other to get through our own bad experiences. I know that the people I've recorded have gotten me to this point. And I hope in some small way, the stories I've been able to tell you will help you get through things. And in turn, I hope you will use your experiences to help others."", '11:40': 'Thank you very much.', '11:41': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in 1950, this guy named James Reifsnyder invented the first snap-on lid. But it didn't have an opening for drinking."", '01:18': ""In the '60s there was this huge cultural shift, where people started drinking coffee on the move. And 7-Eleven was the first to sell coffee to go. And then came this revolution in 1967. A man named Alan Frank invented a lid that you could peel a tab off, like in the shape of a guitar pick, and drink it from there. In 1975, another big advance: you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself. So, more and more people started drinking coffee on the go."", '01:49': ""In 1984, a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids: the birth of the traveler lid. And it is iconic -- you've seen it a million times. And it solved a whole host of problems. It's designed so that you don't splash your face, because it's higher than any of the other ones. And it's got this protruding rim, so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips. It's got a small depression in the center for your nose, so you can really get in there and get maximum aroma. It's got this tiny air hole that lets the steam out and stops it from creating a vacuum."", '02:28': ""This is one of those objects where you just don't notice it until it dribbles on your lap. So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve, and you're going to see a move away from single-use plastic lids to lids that are a little more sustainable. We're not going to stop moving. We're not going to stop drinking coffee. And I think that's what these coffee lid engineers are trying to do, is to make it so that the experience of taking it on the road is as good as sitting in a restaurant, drinking from a ceramic cup. Because, you know, coffee is serious business.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, they’re all based on yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, and we can’t live without.', '00:37': 'Taking a step back, the reason there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons and one pentagon. A molecule must contain this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids out of cholesterol.', '01:26': 'That fatty cholesterol base means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects faster than those other molecules.', '01:57': 'Back to the steroids in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately related to survival, like digestion, and can activate a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s ability to produce inflammation, which, again, can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol.', '03:41': 'Medicinal corticosteroids channel cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression of inflammatory signals.', '04:14': 'The steroids in inhalers and creams impact only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved for emergencies and flare-ups.', '04:57': 'While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, they all have something in common: an immune response that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense against itself.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had to risk you becoming upset while we waited for you to get used to the situation with time and with more experience. You had to get vaccinated. You had to go to school.""', '04:27': ""Little did my parents know, but they were doing more than inoculating me from the measles. They were also inoculating me from a lifetime of anxiety disorders. Excessive anxiety in a young child is like a superbug -- and infectious, even multiplying, such that many of the youth that I see come in with more than one anxiety condition occurring at the same time. For example, they'll have specific phobia plus separation anxiety plus social anxiety all together. Left untreated, anxiety in early childhood can lead to depression by adolescence. It can also contribute to substance abuse and to suicidality."", '05:16': ""My parents were not therapists. They didn't know any psychologists. All they knew is that these situations may have been uncomfortable for me, but they were not harmful. My excessive anxiety would harm me more over the long term if they let me avoid and escape these situations and not learn how to tolerate occasional distress. So in essence, mom and dad were doing their own homegrown version of exposure therapy, which is the central and key component of cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety."", '05:55': 'My colleagues and I conducted the largest randomized controlled study of the treatments of anxiety in children ages seven to 17. We found that child-focused cognitive behavioral exposure therapy or medication with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor are effective for 60 percent of treated youth. And their combination gets 80 percent of kids well within three months. This is all good news. And if they stay on the medication or do monthly exposure treatments as we did in the length of the study, they could stay well for upwards of a year. However, after this treatment study ended, we went back and a did a follow-up study of the participants, and we found that many of these kids relapsed over time. And, despite the best of evidence-based treatments, we also found that for about 40 percent of the kids with anxiety, they remained ill throughout the course of the time.', '07:01': ""We've thought a lot about these results. What were we missing? We've hypothesized that because we were focusing on just child-focused intervention, perhaps there's something important about addressing the parents and involving them in treatment, too."", '07:24': 'Studies from my own lab and from colleagues around the world have shown a consistent trend: well-meaning parents are often inadvertently drawn into the cycle of anxiety. They give in, and they make too many accommodations for their child, and they let their children escape challenging situations. I want you to think about it like this: Your child comes into the house to you crying, in tears. They\'re five or six years of age. ""Nobody at school likes me! These kids are mean. No one would play with me."" How do you feel seeing your child so upset? What do you do? The natural parenting instinct is to comfort that child, soothe them, protect them and fix the situation. Calling the teacher to intervene or the other parents to arrange playdates, that may be fine at age five. But what do you do if your child keeps coming home day after day in tears? Do you still fix things for them at age eight, 10, 14? For children, as they are developing, they invariably are going to be encountering challenging situations: sleepovers, oral reports, a challenging test that pops up, trying out for a sports team or a spot in the school play, conflicts with peers ... All these situations involve risk: risk of not doing well, not getting what they want, risk of maybe making mistakes or being embarrassed.', '09:06': ""For kids with anxiety who don't take risks and engage, they then don't learn how to manage these types of situations. Right? Because skills develop with exposure over time, repeated exposure to everyday situations that kids encounter: self-soothing skills or the ability to calm oneself down when upset; problem-solving skills, including the ability to resolve conflicts with others; delay of gratification, or the ability to keep your efforts going despite the fact that you have to wait over time to see what happens. These and many other skills are developing in children who take risks and engage. And self-efficacy takes shape, which, simply put, is the belief in oneself that you can overcome challenging situations."", '10:05': ""For kids with anxiety who escape and avoid these situations and get other people to do them for them, they become more and more anxious with time while less confident in themselves. Contrary to their peers who don't suffer with anxiety, they come to believe that they are incapable of managing these situations. They think that they need someone, someone like their parents, to do things for them."", '10:36': 'Now, while the natural parenting instinct is to comfort and protect and reassure kids, in 1930, the psychiatrist Alfred Adler had already cautioned parents that we can love a child as much as we wish, but we must not make that child dependent. He advised parents to begin training kids from the very beginning to stand on their own two feet. He also cautioned that if children get the impression that their parents have nothing better to do than be at their beck and call, they would gain a false idea of love.', '11:17': ""For children with anxiety in this day and age, they are always calling their parents or texting distress calls at all hours of the day and night. So if children with anxiety don't learn the proper coping mechanisms when young, what happens to them when they grow up?"", '11:37': ""I run groups for parents of young adults with anxiety disorders. These youth are between the ages of 18 and 28. They are mostly living at home, dependent on their parents. Many of them may have attended school and college. Some have graduated. Almost all are not working, just staying at home and not doing much of anything. They don't have meaningful relationships with others, and they are very, very dependent on their parents to do all sort of things for them. Their parents still make their doctors appointments for them. They call the kids' old friends and beg them to come visit. They do the kids' laundry and cook for them. And they are in great conflict with their young adult, because the anxiety has flourished but the youth has not. These parents feel enormous guilt, but then resentment, and then more guilt."", '12:41': 'OK, how about some good news? If parents and key figures in a child\'s life can help the child, assist them to confront their fears and learn how to problem-solve, then it is more likely that the children are going to develop their own internal coping mechanisms for managing their anxiety. We teach parents now to be mindful in the moment and think about their reaction to their child\'s anxiety. We ask them, ""Look at the situation and ask, \'What is this situation at hand? How threatening is it to my child? And what do I ultimately want them to learn from it?\'""', '13:25': ""Now of course, we want parents to listen very carefully, because if a child is being bullied seriously or put in harm's way, we want parents to intervene, absolutely. But in typical, everyday anxiety-producing situations, parents can be most helpful to their child if they remain calm and matter-of-fact and warm, if they validate the child's feelings but then help the child, assist them in planning how the child is going to manage the situation. And then -- this is key -- to actually have the child deal with the situation themselves."", '14:03': ""Of course, it is heartbreaking to watch a child suffer, as my parents told me years later. When you see your child suffering but you think you could swoop in and save them from the pain of it, that's everything, right? That's what we want to do. But whether we are young or old, excessive anxiety leads us to overestimate risk and distress while underestimating our ability to cope. We know that repeated exposure to what we fear weakens anxiety, while building resources and resilience."", '14:45': ""My parents were on to something. Today's hyper-anxious youth are not being helped by overly protective parenting. Calmness and confidence are not just emotions. They are coping skills that parents and children can learn."", '15:04': 'Thank you.', '15:05': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Susan Shaw shows evidence it's sparing some beaches only at devastating cost to the health of the deep sea.",0:16:28,16.46666667,235380,2016-04-22T22:03:41+00:00,"['TEDx', 'business', 'chemistry', 'disaster relief', 'environment', 'fish', 'oceans', 'oil', 'science']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Susan Shaw,Marine toxicologist,"{'00:09': ""I am a marine toxicologist, and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf, particularly about the massive applications of the toxic dispersants, the Corexits. I've been working on ocean pollution for quite a long time -- the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts on marine mammals. As it turns out, marine mammals are at the top of this food chain that we're pouring millions of tons of toxic substances into every year. And they are showing the signs of this. I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this, but not everything is all that happy, especially in my work. They are loaded with toxic chemicals in their body, hundreds of compounds, all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering. And they're dying off rather regularly, tens of thousands around the world. It's predicted they may go extinct -- about a third of them -- within about 30 years."", '01:12': ""So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic. It's called Seals as Sentinels. We're tracking pollution at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish. It's a region-wide, eco-toxicological investigation. We're looking at a lot of compounds, but recently been quite interested in the flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants that are in many, many things that we use in our everyday life, from the cushions in the chairs we're all sitting on to the plastic casings of our computers, our television sets and so on. So we are tracking how do these things get from the products into the ocean, which is the final sink for them. And there's quite a complicated pathway for that because, as these products age, they get concentrated in dust, and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills. They wind up in waste water treatment plants. As you all know, we throw out billions of computers and TVs every year. And those go to e-waste dumps. And all that gets into surface waters, eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink. So, in our study, we did find quite high levels, as we expected, of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies. And we reported this. It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant called Deca in Maine, where I am based, and also then a phase-out, U.S.-wide, at the end of last year. But we said, well, on the bright side, our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon."", '02:47': 'So then I got really curious, myself, as a toxicologist, and I donated some blood to my lab and said, ""Okay, let\'s do it."" Well, we detected 113 different compounds in my blood. And I must say, if any of you would have this done, you\'d probably find a similar profile, or cocktail, as they call it. But I was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason. And just to point out the levels -- Americans have 10 to 40 times higher levels of these compounds in our bodies than the Europeans. Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything, and we have weak regulations for toxic chemicals. But lo and behold, I\'m one of the high-end individuals. Lucky me. But then I thought, well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.', '03:40': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""So anyway, here's the problem -- and it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today -- we're not regulating chemicals in this country properly. We're hardly regulating them at all. And we're letting industry run the show. And Jackie Savitz spoke this morning about Big Oil and the propaganda and how we're all brainwashed with their, you know, lies and so forth. Well, Big Chemical is what we're dealing with here. And they're allowed to keep trade secrets, so they don't even give the ingredients out. Plus they don't give health and safety data, so, consequently, they cannot be regulated before they go to market. So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is not on the producer."", '04:31': ""So I then was invited to go to the Gulf in May. I went down there on a preliminary investigation to look into dispersants and how they're going into the water column and so forth. And I was told that I was the only toxicologist to date who was dumb enough to get into the water, but I did. And we dove in the slick without even HazMat gear. And I did get sick. I got a ferocious sore throat two days later. I felt like my throat was on fire. But it did pass. And what I did see in the water as we went down, what really shocked me -- and it's haunted me ever since -- because I could see the droplets of oil dispersing. And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton, bumping into, you know, little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores, the herring kind of fish. And you could just see the web of death as you go down in the water column."", '05:34': ""Well, you know, we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off, they say, between the wetlands versus the ocean depth. And I didn't agree with that decision at the time; I still don't. The decision was to protect the marshes. When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out. And as you know, there's been a very weak response, up until recently, to actually collect the oil. It's gotten much more aggressive. This is an Exxon slide showing what happens, the scenario and the trade-off. So this shows oil on the surface. You can see it getting up into the mangrove, but it is not harming the corals or the sea grass, right. So here we have the other scenario. If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals are getting hit pretty hard, but you're saving the mangrove. So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay? Is it better with one or two?"", '06:31': '(Laughter)', '06:33': ""The problem is that we have released so darn much of this stuff, we're climbing up to two million gallons very quickly. And then there's the problem of the plumes. What plumes? It turns out there are plumes. Independent researchers found that. And then there's the looming, messy problem of human health, reported human health effects. And actually, one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress. So ... Having been in that water just for the short time I was there, I can tell you, it is not heat stress. There are volumes of volatile petroleum fumes coming off that water, plus the Corexit, which has solvent in it. So it is not at all rational."", '07:25': ""So what do we have? The BP show is going on. Our officials complained about Corexit, which is the most toxic line of dispersants. But heck, they're still using it, and they used the most toxic one, the 9527, until they ran out of supplies. Now they're on 9500. 9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it that causes internal bleeding. We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way. So what we're doing, we're putting compounds with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill. Does this make sense? So this is the way it works. And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here. It's a micelle. Micelles form around the oil. And what happens first is the solvents break into the oil, the lipid membrane, they let the surfactants in there. The surfactants -- which are like things we use on fast food wrappers -- they grab around the droplets of oil, and they make little, tiny droplets with nice, little surfactant edges to them. The thing to remember about the micelles -- these little floating globules of toxin -- is they are there to deliver. They're like the FedEx guys. And if you're a fish, and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning, you're going to get it in the afternoon, because they've got your number."", '08:52': ""So from a toxicology perspective, this is really awful because Corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone. And usually the exposure is a combined exposure. The dispersants -- as I was saying -- their job is to break down the lipid membrane. The solvents in them do that very efficiently. So they break down lipid membranes in our body, starting with cells of the skin, the cells of organs. So it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily. Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds that are toxic to every organ in the body. And so with the dispersants combined, you have this very synergistic combined toxicity. Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds. And I'm part of a chat group, which is a national group of toxicologists and chemists that are, you know, basically turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff, and what is it doing and what are the interactions of these chemicals, most of which we don't know, and what are their byproducts, which are usually more toxic than the parent compound. So we did find that Corexit 9500 contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium -- arsenic at high enough levels to have cancer-causing effects."", '10:27': ""So this is what we have to look at, these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets, which have nothing on them much. And now they were forced to release the ultimate list of everything that's in Corexit. And guess what, tons of stuff is missing. Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups of many, many compounds, these sorbitans. And then you get down to the petroleum distillates, which are the solvents, hundreds of them. They are not identified. And why? Trade secrets again. BP's running the show, and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do. So far these ingredients have not been released, and toxicologists are actually going nuts because we cannot predict with certainty what the interactions and toxic results are going to be."", '11:21': ""But we do have quite a lot at risk down there, as we all know, the 33 wildlife refuges, so much wildlife and fish and diversity. So we know from previous spills. And then part of this is just part of my bad dreams. And I appreciate being able to vent some of my anguish upon you. What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard. And this is a study that was done on the Australian coast, the coast of Tasmania. Corals are, you know, the home to about a quarter of all marine species. And with the Corexit and the oil, there's zero percent fertilization. With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization. So they're a very sensitive species to this combo."", '12:14': ""Here's another group. I could see myself easily in the water column. The plankton and the plankton eaters, you know, these are the little herring fish that go through the water column with their mouths open, feeding indiscriminately and just lapping up this brown pudding of toxic stuff. And we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture. See the oil and Corexit is causing death at a much, much lower dose than oil alone. That's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects. But my bad dreams go like this. The piscivorous fish, the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish, also the tuna and sharks, are going to hit by this. And the gills are quite sensitive. The respiratory system is very sensitive. Think about it with the Corexit hitting the membranes, and it will clog up the gills, and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemical pneumonia, trying to aspirate the compounds. It also will cause internal bleeding upon ingestion. I'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them, but also, the way their going to be exposed is every time they come to the surface to take a breath, they're going to inhale these volatile fumes. And what does happen with that eventually is pneumonia sets in and liver, kidney, brain damage. The Corexit is transporting the oil into every membrane and every system of the body. And you're having a lot of different unpleasant effects, but burns to the eyes and mouth, skin ulcers, lesions. And I think, personally, that we have not begun to see the impacts of this spill on the wildlife of the Gulf."", '14:11': ""We started hypothesizing: what do we know? what do with think would be a trophic cascade? which means that somebody gets wiped out, and then everything above that's eating those guys will crash. So our thought was -- this is a simple thinking process, but ... obviously the plankton, the planktivores, and that's about as far as we got. And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out. This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen, this trophic cascade where you lose the kelp and the herring and other fishes and going up. They thought that eventually the killer whale would be at the top of this cascade. And then here's what really happened, much more complicated, much more specific. Actually the kelp and the barnacles that attach to the rock were decimated by the combination of Corexit and the oil. They were replaced by invasive species, which had less holding power to the rock. Storms came along. They ripped out of the rock. And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks. And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks from the Exxon Valdez spill, and they haven't come back."", '15:26': ""So we are launching an independent study. And by independent, I do not mean alone; I mean independent in the sense of not tied to the kind of crime-scene secrecy that's going on in the Gulf now. But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts, but we need lots and lots of partners to do this intelligently. We have some of the partners lined up. And Dave Gallo signed on. Sylvia's in here. And we hope that some of you will help us. My question to you is: why shouldn't we know? Don't we have the right to know? Surely we have the right to learn what loss we are going through in the Gulf. And my wish would be -- for the gulf prize -- would be that we have the truth. Whatever it is, please let us have the truth. And to get there, we need to do the assessment."", '16:25': 'So I appreciate being here.

But the recurring answer from producers was I was not Kenyan enough. Meaning what? I didn't sing fully in the slang derivative of Kiswahili and I didn't sing enough party tracks, so they said Kenyans wouldn't listen to a Kenyan who sounded like me. This idea of otherism, the exclusion of a person based on their perceived deviation from the norms, goes to the root of the problems in Kenya. And it runs deep."", '00:40': ""Kenya was invented by colonialists in 1895, and with it, came the erasure of our identity and the class system built on otherism. So by 1963, when we received our independence, these ideas had already become the new normal. Now, we've tried a lot of different ways to move forward since. We have a common language, currency, infrastructure, basically all the things that make a country a country. But all these efforts at nation-building do not go to the heart of the matter. Which is this: we cannot build what we do not truly love. And we cannot love until we love ourselves. The thing we have to heal, us Kenyans, is our lack of self-love, our deep self-hate and our existential identity crisis. And this is the work of nation-building that only the creative industry can do."", '01:32': ""The idea that Kenya can only include some of us led me to found a music festival in 2008 called Blankets and Wine, to give a platform to myself and other misfits. Ten years later, we've programmed over 200 bands and put at least 100,000 dollars directly into the hands of artists and managers, who have in turn spent it on technicians, rehearsals, music videos and other things along the music value chain. Our platform has allowed for multiple Kenyan identities to exist, while inspiring the industry to discover and engage the wide variety of Kenyan music. What we do is necessary but insufficient. And we must urgently pivot into a live music circuit."", '02:14': 'But there are other ways music can help heal the nation. According to a 2018 state of media report, traditional radio is sill by far the biggest distributor of ideas in Kenya, with 47 percent of Kenyans still choosing radio first. This presents an opportunity. We can use radio to help Kenyans hear the diversity that is Kenya. We can reserve 60 percent of all programing on Kenyan radio for Kenyan music. We can break down ethnic barriers by playing Kenyan music done in English, Kiswahili and other ethnic languages, on what is now single-language ethnic radio. Radio can help stimulate interest and demand for Kenyan music by Kenyans, while also providing the much-needed incomes by way of royalties. But more importantly, radio can help us build a more inclusive narrative about Kenya. For you cannot love what you do not know exists.', '03:12': ""Other creative industries too can do the work. When you consider that 41 percent of Kenyans still choose TV as their primary medium, it's obvious that film has a huge potential. The meager resources that have been put into the sector have already produced world-class acts, like Lupita Nyong'o and Wanuri Kahiu, but we are going to need a lot more incentives and investments to make filming in Kenya easier, so more Kenyan stories can get on the Kenyan TV and spark off the really difficult conversations we need to have with one another. We're going to need to grow a lot more home-grown stars, so we can reverse the idea that we have to blow up abroad before we get the acceptance and validation of home."", '03:56': ""Fashion too can do the work. We need to make it possible to affordably mass-produce Kenyan clothes for Kenyan consumers, so we don't all have to rely on second-hand imports. The first running shoe made in Kenya needs to be a local and global success as an ode to Kenyan excellence, epitomized by Kenyan runners, who are literally world-class. For these ideas to come to life, jobs will be created, and Kenyan ideas will be exported.

I'm a sign-language interpreter that specializes in music interpreting. And you're probably wondering why Deaf people would attend concerts, but actually, music is so much more than sound simply traveling through the ear. See, Deaf people experience music, just in a different way. For example, my friend Lisa, she cuts her hair a certain length, so she feels the vibrations of sound in the music. And music has psychological effects on us. It invokes feelings of nostalgia, happiness, sadness, falling in love. It makes you have a feeling of connectedness, and unfortunately, Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are excluded from these events, because obtaining a sign-language interpreter is so difficult and so overwhelming that they simply don't buy the tickets or they just give up, and this is not OK. We have to make everything accessible."", '01:11': ""So, myself, I am a sign-language interpreter, so what I have to do is I have to take music and bring it to life. In doing that, I become a bridge between the hearing world and the Deaf world, making sure that I'm representing music and the artistry of what music represents. Now, this is a lot of work, OK? For a regular set that might be 12 songs, myself and a team, we have to study over 30 songs or more for one set and hope and pray we have the right setlist."", '01:46': ""But you know what? You know what the reward is? Looking down in the audience and seeing Deaf and hard-of-hearing members, all of those people dancing and jamming out and feeling included in that music experience.

Some of us sign and voice, some of us just sign, but no one way is superior to the other."", '02:16': ""But you know what?

But it was only until three years ago, when I ran the London Marathon bleeding freely on my cycle to combat the global menstrual stigma that women face every day all around the world, that I realized that I have a message, and that the most effective way that I can convey my message was through my music."", '07:32': 'And why music? Because music caters to the emotions. Music is joyful. Music pulls you in with the beat and the rhythm and the melodies. The music pulls you in via the community aspect of it. And music allows you to access somebody else\'s truth. In the music I listen to today, sometimes I\'m like, wow, I love the rhythm so much, but the message is so misogynist, it\'s tough to work out to our run to or do whatever it is that I\'m trying to do.

The doctor will soon inject its contents into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in a particle accelerator, just hours earlier.', '00:50': 'The particle accelerator in question is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles like protons faster and faster along a spiraling path. When the protons reach their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking to get the scan done.', '01:44': 'So how can fluorine-18 be used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia.', '02:13': ""The FDG is now ready for the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain, cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner."", '02:43': 'The radiation that the tracer emits is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for.', '03:58': 'But with all this talk of radiation and nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks are acceptable for the chance to diagnose and treat their illnesses.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure: it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out -- that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past, a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years, if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times since I was born. When you have a new baby, by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented, and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part."", '01:23': ""Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets -- versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just -- these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc., in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance? Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning, the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle -- that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years: it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans, are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it."", '02:39': ""Now, the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same -- (Laughter) -- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans-versus-nature; we've won, there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into, that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. -- they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed, transported, housed and so on. And the information technology, which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity? It's just going up through the roof. And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with."", '04:10': ""So, that's the stage out of all this. I find, for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words, the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable; economically, it's achievable; politically, it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual -- and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills, somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school, which is putting information and dogma into them, get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book, think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time -- it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient -- which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy, less material. Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power, and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc."", '06:12': ""Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in 1976 and 77, winning the Kremer prize in aviation history, followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land, in the air, on water -- vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same, whether its land, air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane -- 165 miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors -- the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars, what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact, they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product."", '07:40': 'With that preamble, let\'s show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously, and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere -- an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet. (Music) The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world\'s energy future. In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England, solely on the power of sunbeams, and established a basis for the Pathfinder. (Music) The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: ""there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less.""', '09:48': ""Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort, and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span -- and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night, and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time. (Music) Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home. The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts -- (Music) this is starting -- made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere, the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is -- probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite, because it can stay right overhead for months at a time, 2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you."", '12:14': ""But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams, his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces -- that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it, the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope, with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan, just any time you're -- all right -- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan: It's switched on. PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK: Can you bring up the house lights? PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. (Applause) PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it -- there it goes. Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you, it will not hurt you. (Laughter) OK. (Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)"", '14:52': ""But now, as they say in infomercials, we have something much better for you, which we're working on: planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month, showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it, but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK, here we go. (Laughter) MK: Sorry. OK. (Applause) PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think -- I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually. (Laughter) But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA."", '16:22': ""Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know. But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology, you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake, you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature, for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects."", '17:04': ""In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species, no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom; we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?"", '17:53': ""Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one -- tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems, and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there, but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years. Things are going on this decade, next decade; it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age -- I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning, not a forecast. That was before -- I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted? I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based. And so where it all goes, I don't know."", '19:31': ""The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle, which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that -- rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you. MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram. PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin. And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it. So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. (Applause) And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been -- (Laughter) (Applause) Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down, but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there -- (Laughter) -- than it ever had. And I wanted to make -- (Applause) just -- (Applause)"", '21:23': ""But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous; there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago -- there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor, there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger, there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate on zero-emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time, probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams, like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that, as a symbol, it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature, and puts it all together in things that are -- that make this conference, I think, more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you.

Like walking on water, like flying. I think it's really about being one with a natural phenomenon."", '00:16': '[Small thing. Big idea.]', '00:21': ""The surfboard requires a lot of ergonomic thinking. How do I stand on it? How do I not slip off? But at the same time, it really has to work in that fluid environment. It's really considered for the rider in some areas and for water and physics in others."", '00:36': ""A surfboard is made out of a core element which tends to be foam, which makes the board float, and the skin of the board is some kind of resin, epoxy, sometimes fiberglass. There often is also a stringer, a wood piece down the middle, which makes it stronger. The rocker is the curvature of the board in the front. That is important because that determines what kind of wave you will be able to take, how steep the wave is. The tail affects performance. Different tails will make the board react differently, so it's a lot about personal preference."", '01:09': ""Our understanding of surfing comes from when the Tahitians in 1200 AD brought it to Hawaii. So when James Cook arrived around 1780, he was mesmerized by hundreds of people in the water, children, women, men, surfing naked. Calvinist missionaries arrive and they're scandalized by it. It becomes an illegal activity. It becomes counterculture."", '01:33': 'The father of modern surfing is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku. He is an extraordinary swimmer, wins gold at the Olympics in 1912. Goes around the world to show his swimming but brings surfboards and demonstrates surfing. Imagine, people had never seen surfing before. Suddenly, some person from a faraway place is standing on water, riding on water.', '01:55': ""He comes back to Hawaii, and they start to make more boards. Pre-Second World War, you're still looking at big, heavy wood boards. Post-Second World War, new materials and new technologies become available, and those make the board lighter, more accessible, cheaper, but it continues to be a custom object, something that is made specifically for a person or for a certain spot."", '02:17': ""It's a very symbiotic relationship between surfer and shaper. There's so many different criteria that affect the physics of how that surfboard is moving in water."", '02:28': 'A longboard is typically used on smaller waves. The riding has a lot of style. You can walk the board, put your toes over it, do a hang ten.', '02:37': ""A shortboard will be faster. They're harder to ride, they sink under the body. Board design comes at the intersection between those physical factors, and really, how I want to put myself in the water. It's an expression as much as it is a physical activity. The draw may be because water is so elusive. You can't fight it, you can't change it."", '02:59': ""The best I can do is recognize what it does. The surf may be big and getting bigger and surging while you're in the water. The elements are changing. The wind is coming up. You have to be in symbiosis with the environment. You need to look and feel for everything that's happening around you. And yet, it's so short. Five, eight, 15 seconds. It's fleeting, but you have to go back to it.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The writer blamed their deaths on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed on a nearby marsh.', '00:25': 'The letter was the push Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries through government contacts from her years working in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced the voices of spring?”', '00:51': 'In 1962, Carson published her findings in ""Silent Spring."" Her book documented the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature and human health. ""Silent Spring"" immediately drew both applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist and writer ignite such controversy?', '01:16': 'Carson began her career as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father and sister. Carson found part time work with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, and in 1936, she became the second woman to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated with a wide audience.', '02:02': 'In ""Silent Spring,"" Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants.', '02:35': 'In spite of this and other mishaps, the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences for future generations.', '03:19': 'The response to ""Silent Spring"" was explosive. For many people the book was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.”', '04:01': 'In reality, Carson had focused on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, but of ourselves.”', '04:22': 'Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after the publication of ""Silent Spring."" Her work galvanized a generation of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure from environmentalists, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact of her writing.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compass is the key."", '00:21': '[Small thing.]', '00:22': '[Big idea.]', '00:26': ""A compass is most simply a piece of metal that has been magnetized, so that it will turn towards the Earth's magnetic pole.

You can hold it in your hand and watch the little needle bounce around until you find north."", '00:44': 'Magnetism is still a pretty mysterious force to physicists, but what we do know for sure is that a compass works because the Earth is this giant magnet. And when you use a compass, you are in touch with the very center of our planet, where this kind of roiling ball of molten iron is spinning around and creating a magnetic field. Just like a magnet you can play with on your tabletop, it has a north pole and a south pole, and we use compasses to find our way north because of that fact.', '01:14': 'The earliest known compass comes from about 200 BC in China. They figured out that some of the metal coming out of the ground was naturally magnetic, and so they fashioned this magnetized metal into this kind of ladle-looking thing, put it on a brass plate and then it would point north. It seems to have been primarily used to improve feng shui, so they could figure out what was the best way for energy to flow through their living spaces.', '01:40': 'Sailors were probably the early adopters of the more portable versions of it, because no matter where the sun was, no matter what the condition of the stars were, they would always be able to find north.', '01:51': ""Now, much later, the Europeans are the ones who innovate and come up with the compass rose. It essentially laid out what north, south, east and west looked like, and it also enabled you to kind of create new directions, like northwest, southeast, what have you. And for the first time, they knew where they were going. That's kind of a big deal."", '02:11': 'But also, I think it was part of this general reinvigoration of European science. You might know it as the Renaissance. Lots of new tools were invented, from the telescope to the microscope.', '02:22': 'Maps got better because of compasses, right? Because then you start to understand which direction is which, you get a lot more detail, and that just kind of changes the human relationship to the world.

That\'s how I went to school -- pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father, ""You have to make a choice."" I walked very comfortably to this missionary school, that was run by an American missionary. The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy. I had never in my life ever tasted candy.

I don\'t know why, but I did. All of a sudden I passed the national examination, found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya. And I finished high school. And just walking, I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States. My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut, none of my brothers were going to school, and this man told me, ""Here, go.""', '01:12': 'I got a scholarship to St. Lawrence University, Upstate New York; finished that. And after that I went to Harvard Graduate School; finished that. Then I worked in DC a little bit: I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history. And every time, I kept going back home, listening to their problems -- sick people, people with no water, all this stuff -- every time I go back to America, I kept thinking about them.', '01:38': 'Then one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this: long time ago, there was a big war between tribes. This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe. Every time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them. So one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers, ""The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they\'ll be here."" So people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out. But there were two men: one man was blind, one man had no legs -- he was born like that. The leader of the chiefs said, ""No, sorry. We can\'t take you. You\'ll slow us down. We have to flee our women and children, we have to run."" And they were left behind, waiting to die.', '02:19': 'But these two people worked something out.

The man with no legs says, ""I can see as far as the end of the world, but I can\'t save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."" The blind man went down on his knees like this, and told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up. The man on top can see, the blind man can walk. These guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them.', '02:51': 'So, this was told to me in a setup of elders. And it\'s a really poor area. I represent Northern Kenya: the most nomadic, remote areas you can even find. And that man told me, ""So, here you are.

The truth is that our consumption and disposal of plastic has reached such unsustainable proportions that we need to address this using every idea and resource at hand.', '00:27': ""Please welcome someone who's helping solve India's waste management issues, Mani Vajipey, recycler and cofounder/CEO of Banyan Nation."", '00:38': '(Applause)', '00:45': ""Mani Vajipey: If recycling were an Olympic sport, India would win the gold medal. India has one of the highest rates of plastic recycling and recovery in the entire world. Higher than the likes of Singapore, countries in North America and even countries in Europe. India recovers and recycles over 60 percent of its plastic waste, whereas a developed country, like United States, manages just about 10 percent. This high rate of collection is largely possible thanks to the millions of informal recyclers, the kabadiwalas, the bhandiwallas and the raddiwalas that we find at every street corner across every city in India. And yet, in spite of such a ubiquitous, extensive and intricate network of recyclers, India's national scenery is dominated by filth and squalor. And the general perception is that we don't recycle our plastics."", '01:44': ""The other thing about plastics in India is that any product made from recycled plastic is considered to be substandard and we expect it to be cheaper as well. What we don't realize is there are several types of plastics in their virgin and pure form, if recycled scientifically, can be recycled several times over without any compromise in quality. If we can recover and reuse our discarded plastic, then we save a significant amount of virgin plastic that we would have otherwise produced and consumed. And this is very important, because virgin plastic is made from fossil fuels that are an exhaustible resource. The more virgin plastic we produce and consume, the more plastic waste we have to manage."", '02:32': ""Mismanagement of plastic waste leads to the leakage of such materials into our water bodies. It's now common knowledge that by the year 2050 we'll have more plastics in our oceans than fish."", '02:46': ""About seven years ago, my friend and cofounder Raj and I, we decided that we were going to focus on solving this massive problem. We went around the city of Hyderabad, talking to local recyclers. Very soon, we found out that there were many recyclers just in Hyderabad alone. We soon realized that the plastic recycling industry of today is not very different from the milk industry of the '60s and '70s. Milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers, with two or three cows or buffalos, who produce five to ten liters of milk a day. Instead of blindly aping solutions from the West, India championed the milk cooperative model, where thousands of such small-scale recyclers were brought together into groups. With scale came innovations and investments. India was transformed from a milk-deficit nation to the world's leading exporter and producer of milk. It dawned upon us that India had in the past solved much larger problems, like milk deficiency. We only need to look back to our past to find inspiration in solving what is perhaps the most fundamental issue of our times, that is plastic pollution."", '04:00': ""But before we could do this, or before brands could use recycled plastic, we had to solve two things. Quality and scale. For us, to make a shampoo bottle from discarded plastics, we had to collect tens of thousands of tons of discarded plastics. For that, we needed data. Raj and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recyclers, giving us a bird's eye view of every recycler in Hyderabad. The results were astounding. There were 2,000 kabadiwalas just in Hyderabad alone. That means, for every square kilometer, there were four kabadiwalas or informal recyclers. No developed country or city in the entire world has the luxury of such a brilliant collection system."", '04:48': '(Applause)', '04:51': ""Once we had the data, the rest was fairly straightforward. We started trading with the informal recyclers, we started training them to segregate the materials based on our quality specifications. In the past five years, we've developed several clusters across South India, comprising of thousands of such informal recyclers, who interact with us both directly and digitally. In parallel, we began working on the problem of quality and purity of material. So in the past five years, we developed a proprietary cleaning technology that allows us to eliminate all contaminants."", '05:26': ""Today, Banyan's recycled granules have undergone stringent quality testing and have been certified by top global FMCG and automotive companies. In the next few months, tens of thousands of discarded plastics collected through informal recycler networks will be converted into high-quality granules and sent away to brands and large companies to make bottles for engine-oil packaging, for shampoo bottles and for lotions. In the next three years, we expect that over 500 million such bottles will be made from our recycled plastics."", '06:05': '(Applause)', '06:09': 'But this is just the beginning. In the next five years, we aspire to build an India where 100 percent of discarded plastics are recycled and repurposed scientifically -- where plastic waste no longer threatens our water bodies, and the very survival of our terrestrial and marine life.', '06:28': ""So the next time you go to a store and pick up a shampoo bottle, see if that bottle uses safe and sustainable recycled plastic. That's not only just going to help the Earth but also reward the street corner recycler for his all-important work. Now that will compel brands to use more and more recycled plastic for their mainstream products and applications."", '06:50': ""Our tradition and our culture has a lot of ancient wisdom. Let's not destroy the only planet we have. The only home we have."", '07:00': 'Thank you.', '07:01': '(Applause)', '07:07': ""SRK: Thank you, Mani. When I was young, I used to -- (sings in Hindi).

Cities like New York and Paris today are looking to put out reverse vending machines so that people can go and put trash in that and then they can get some cash. For the past several decades, the entire country and the kabadiwalas, and the bhandiwallas, we have been doing that. I'm very positive that in three to five years, you'll wake up, you know that the plastic is being recycled, you're going to pick up a packaging, you know that the package actually has a mark that uses recycled plastics, so I'm super optimistic about this. Even as an entrepreneur."", '07:56': '(Applause)', '07:59': 'SRK: When I see a youngster do what he has done and achieved, I want that part to also be a source of encouragement for people to take over.

Now, with the voyage departing, he had one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the opposite direction.', '00:36': 'By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had been visited and mapped, with only two key locations remaining: the North Pole, deep in the frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to what he called “the last great problem.”', '01:20': 'But Amundsen’s crew weren’t the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted against the Norwegian in what the newspapers called a ‘race to the Pole.’', '01:49': ""Yet if it was a race, it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times from different locations, and they had very different plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of men and more than a hundred dogs.  His explorers were clothed in sealskin and furs, as well as specially designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated.  Launching an extensive scientific research expedition, he traveled with over three times more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies,  they found both their ponies and motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow."", '02:51': ""In the spring of 1911, after waiting out the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains.  They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first at their desolate destination."", '03:27': 'To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed the area in a grid to make sure they covered the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp, two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary, would not be found until spring.', '04:13': 'Today, scientists from various countries  live and work at Antarctic research stations.

In the spring, I'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs. In the summer, I loved the electric glow of fireflies as they would zip around on muggy nights. In the fall, the bogs were brimming with the bright red of cranberries. Even winter had its charms, with the Christmassy bouquet emanating from pine trees. For me, nature has always been a source of wonder and inspiration."", '00:34': ""As I went on to graduate school in chemistry, and in later years, I came to better understand the natural world in molecular detail. All the things that I just mentioned, from the scents of lilacs and pines to the bright red of cranberries and the glow of fireflies, have at least one thing in common: they're manufactured by enzymes."", '00:52': ""As I said, I grew up in Wisconsin, so of course, I like cheese and the Green Bay Packers. But let's talk about cheese for a minute. For at least the last 7,000 years, humans have extracted a mixture of enzymes from the stomachs of cows and sheep and goats and added it to milk. This causes the milk to curdle -- it's part of the cheese-making process. The key enzyme in this mixture is called chymosin. I want to show you how that works."", '01:15': ""Right here, I've got two tubes, and I'm going to add chymosin to one of these. Just a second here. Now my son Anthony, who is eight years old, was very interested in helping me figure out a demo for the TED Talk, and so we were in the kitchen, we were slicing up pineapples, extracting enzymes from red potatoes and doing all kinds of demos in the kitchen. And in the end, though, we thought the chymosin demo was pretty cool. And so what's happening here is the chymosin is swimming around in the milk, and it's binding to a protein there called casein. What it does then is it clips the casein -- it's like a molecular scissors. It's that clipping action that causes the milk to curdle. So here we are in the kitchen, working on this. OK. So let me give this a quick zip. And then we'll set these to the side and let these simmer for a minute. OK."", '02:13': ""If DNA is the blueprint of life, enzymes are the laborers that carry out its instructions. An enzyme is a protein that's a catalyst, it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction, just as the chymosin over here is accelerating the curdling of the milk. But it's not just about cheese. While enzymes do play an important role in the foods that we eat, they also are involved in everything from the health of an infant to attacking the biggest environmental challenges we have today."", '02:39': ""The basic building blocks of enzymes are called amino acids. There are 20 common amino acids, and we typically designate them with single-letter abbreviations, so it's really an alphabet of amino acids. In an enzyme, these amino acids are strung together, like pearls on a necklace. And it's really the identity of the amino acids, which letters are in that necklace, and in what order they are, what they spell out, that gives an enzyme its unique properties and differentiates it from other enzymes. Now, this string of amino acids, this necklace, folds up into a higher-order structure. And if you were to zoom in at the molecular level and take a look at chymosin, which is the enzyme working over here, you would see it looks like this. It's all these strands and loops and helices and twists and turns, and it has to be in just this conformation to work properly."", '03:24': ""Nowadays, we can make enzymes in microbes, and that can be like a bacteria or a yeast, for example. And the way we do this is we get a piece of DNA that codes for an enzyme that we're interested in, we insert that into the microbe, and we let the microbe use its own machinery, its own wherewithal, to produce that enzyme for us. So if you wanted chymosin, you wouldn't need a calf, nowadays -- you could get this from a microbe. And what's even cooler, I think, is we can now dial in completely custom DNA sequences to make whatever enzymes we want, stuff that's not out there in nature. And, to me, what's really the fun part is trying to design an enzyme for a new application, arranging the atoms just so."", '04:02': 'The act of taking an enzyme from nature and playing with those amino acids, tinkering with those letters, putting some letters in, taking some letters out, maybe rearranging them a little bit, is a little bit like finding a book and editing a few chapters or changing the ending. In 2018, the Nobel prize in chemistry was given for the development of this approach, which is known as directed evolution.', '04:25': ""Nowadays, we can harness the powers of directed evolution to design enzymes for custom purposes, and one of these is designing enzymes for doing applications in new areas, like laundry. So just as enzymes in your body can help you to break down the food that you eat, enzymes in your laundry detergent can help you to break down the stains on your clothes. It turns out that about 90 percent of the energy that goes into doing the wash is from water heating. And that's for good reason -- the warmer water helps to get your clothes clean. But what if you were able to do the wash in cold water instead? You certainly would save some money, and in addition to that, according to some calculations done by Procter and Gamble, if all households in the US were to do the laundry in cold water, we would save the emissions of 32 metric tons of CO2 each year. That's a lot, that's about the equivalent of the carbon dioxide emitted by 6.3 million cars."", '05:19': ""So, how would we go about designing an enzyme to realize these changes? Enzymes didn't evolve to clean dirty laundry, much less in cold water. But we can go to nature, and we can find a starting point. We can find an enzyme that has some starting activity, some clay that we can work with. So this is an example of such an enzyme, right here on the screen. And we can start playing with those amino acids, as I said, putting some letters in, taking some letters out, rearranging those. And in doing so, we can generate thousands of enzymes. And we can take those enzymes, and we can test them in little plates like this."", '05:53': ""So this plate that I'm holding in my hands contains 96 wells, and in each well is a piece of fabric with a stain on it. And we can measure how well each of these enzymes are able to remove the stains from the pieces of fabric, and in that way see how well it's working. And we can do this using robotics, like you'll see in just a second on the screen."", '06:16': ""OK, so we do this, and it turns out that some of the enzymes are sort of in the ballpark of the starting enzyme. That's nothing to write home about. Some are worse, so we get rid of those. And then some are better. Those improved ones become our version 1.0s. Those are the enzymes that we want to carry forward, and we can repeat this cycle again and again. And it's the repetition of this cycle that lets us come up with a new enzyme, something that can do what we want. And after several cycles of this, we did come up with something new. So you can go to the supermarket today, and you can buy a laundry detergent that lets you do the wash in cold water because of enzymes like this here. And I want to show you how this one works too."", '06:54': ""So I've got two more tubes here, and these are both milk again. And let me show you, I've got one that I'm going to add this enzyme to and one that I'm going to add some water to. And that's the control, so nothing should happen in that tube. You might find it curious that I'm doing this with milk. But the reason that I'm doing this is because milk is just loaded with proteins, and it's very easy to see this enzyme working in a protein solution, because it's a master protein chopper, that's its job."", '07:24': ""So let me get this in here. And you know, as I said, it's a master protein chopper and what you can do is you can extrapolate what it's doing in this milk to what it would be doing in your laundry. So this is kind of a way to visualize what would be happening. OK, so those both went in. And I'm going to give this a quick zip as well. OK, so we'll let these sit over here with the chymosin sample, so I'm going to come back to those toward the end."", '08:00': ""Well, what's on the horizon for enzyme design? Certainly, it will get it faster -- there are now approaches for evolving enzymes that allow researchers to go through far more samples than I just showed you. And in addition to tinkering with natural enzymes, like we've been talking about, some scientists are now trying to design enzymes from scratch, using machine learning, an approach from artificial intelligence, to inform their enzyme designs. Still others are adding unnatural amino acids to the mix. We talked about the 20 natural amino acids, the common amino acids, before -- they're adding unnatural amino acids to make enzymes with properties unlike those that could be found in nature. That's a pretty neat area."", '08:39': 'How will designed enzymes affect you in years to come? Well, I want to focus on two areas: human health and the environment. Some pharmaceutical companies now have teams that are dedicated to designing enzymes to make drugs more efficiently and with fewer toxic catalysts. For example, Januvia, which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes, is made partially with enzymes. The number of drugs made with enzymes is sure to grow in the future.', '09:08': ""In another area, there are certain disorders in which a single enzyme in a person's body doesn't work properly. An example of this is called phenylketonuria, or PKU for short. People with PKU are unable to properly metabolize or digest phenylalanine, which is one of the 20 common amino acids that we've been talking about. The consequence of ingesting phenylalanine for people with PKU is that they are subject to permanent intellectual disabilities, so it's a scary thing to have. Now, those of you with kids -- do you guys have kids, here, which ones have kids? A lot of you. So may be familiar with PKUs, because all infants in the US are required to be tested for PKU. I remember when Anthony, my son, had his heel pricked to test for it. The big challenge with this is: What do you eat? Phenylalanine is in so many foods, it's incredibly hard to avoid. Now, Anthony has a nut allergy, and I thought that was tough, but PKU's on another level of toughness. However, new enzymes may soon enable PKU patients to eat whatever they want. Recently, the FDA approved an enzyme designed to treat PKU. This is big news for patients, and it's actually very big news for the field of enzyme-replacement therapy more generally, because there are other targets out there where this would be a good approach."", '10:24': ""So that was a little bit about health. Now I'm going to move to the environment. When I read about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- by the way, that's, like, this huge island of plastic, somewhere between California and Hawaii -- and about microplastics pretty much everywhere, it's upsetting. Plastics aren't going away anytime soon. But enzymes may help us in this area as well. Recently, bacteria producing plastic-degrading enzymes were discovered. Efforts are already underway to design improved versions of these enzymes. At the same time, there are enzymes that have been discovered and that are being optimized to make non-petroleum-derived biodegradable plastics."", '11:02': ""Enzymes may also offer some help in capturing greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Now, there is no doubt, these are major challenges, and none of them are easy. But our ability to harness enzymes may help us to tackle these in the future, so I think that's another area to be looking forward."", '11:21': ""So now I'm going to get back to the demo -- this is the fun part. So we'll start with the chymosin samples. So let me get these over here. And you can see here, this is the one that got the water, so nothing should happen to this milk. This is the one that got the chymosin. So you can see that it totally clarified up here. There's all this curdled stuff, that's cheese, we just made cheese in the last few minutes. So this is that reaction that people have been doing for thousands and thousands of years. I'm thinking about doing this one at our next Kids to Work Day demo but they can be a tough crowd, so we'll see."", '11:55': '(Laughter)', '11:56': ""And then the other one I want to look at is this one. So this is the enzyme for doing your laundry. And you can see that it's different than the one that has the water added. It's kind of clarifying, and that's just what you want for an enzyme in your laundry, because you want to be able to have an enzyme that can be a protein chowhound, just chew them up, because you're going to get different protein stains on your clothes, like chocolate milk or grass stains, for example, and something like this is going to help you get them off. And this is also going to be the thing that allows you to do the wash in cold water, reduce your carbon footprint and save you some money."", '12:34': ""Well, we've come a long way, considering this 7,000-year journey from enzymes in cheese making to the present day and enzyme design. We're really at a creative crossroads, and with enzymes, can edit what nature wrote or write our own stories with amino acids."", '12:52': ""So next time you're outdoors on a muggy night and you see a firefly, I hope you think of enzymes. They're doing amazing things for us today. And by design, they could be doing even more amazing things tomorrow."", '13:05': 'Thank you.', '13:06': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But when examined through the eye of an evolutionist, our romantic whims and sexual desires can start to make more sense, and even seem a bit predictable. Biological anthropologist David Puts confronts how we compete, care and copulate based on evolutionary biology -- and what that means for our love lives.",,,223647,2019-02-01T23:48:34+00:00,"['science', 'love', 'sex', 'anthropology']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', 'עברית', '中文 (繁體)']",David Puts,Biological anthropologist,"{'0:00': ""Hi there. I could be wrong, but I think this talk may have the distinction of being the one talk in this series that ends with orgasm. (Laughter) But let's not get ahead of ourselves. (Laughter) Have you ever thought about the fact that you're here, alive on this planet because every one of your ancestors reproduced? Every one, in an unbroken chain, all the way back to the first life on this planet, over three and a half billion years ago. That's a lot of reproducing. And for the past billion years, your ancestors reproduced sexually. So sex is a pretty big deal. But you probably knew that. But let's talk about human mating. Why does human mating take the forms that it does? Why are we attracted to certain people? Why do we sometimes form long-term romantic relationships? Why do we sometimes cheat? Now I don't mean why consciously do we do these things. I don't mean what happens in the brain to cause it. I mean, why did we evolve these feelings and these behaviors? In other words, how did the underlying brain structures and brain chemistry contribute to our ancestors' reproductive success so that those traits got passed on into the present generation while others didn't. Answering evolutionary questions like this is like being a crime scene investigator, we're left with the evidence, and we have to try to establish what happened. So let's go back six or seven million years ago to our early ancestors. This is right after the split between our lineage and the lineage that would eventually give rise to chimpanzees. Now these were small brained apes, they walked on two legs, and males probably fought each other for mating opportunities. We know this because males fight for mates in all of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas. And because males are larger than females when they fight for mates. And the fossil record indicates that our male ancestors were larger than females. So males tend to be larger, more muscular, stronger, more physically aggressive, when they fight for mates. Our species has all the hallmarks of a species that's experienced an evolutionary history of male fighting for mates. For example, men have, on average, 60 percent more muscle mass, and 75 percent more upper body muscle mass, and those differences in musculature translate into large sex differences in strength. The average man is stronger than 99.9% of women. These are data on hand strength, which is a good predictor of overall upper body strength, on over 600 men and women. And as you can see, there's a large sex difference. And in fact, not one of almost 400 women had as strong of a hand strength as the average man. So, men can open jars. (Laughter) And move furniture or at least two things that we're good for. Who cares, right? The answer is that men care. Men, especially young men, seem really concerned about figuring out who's the toughest or strongest, or the most physically formidable, and sometimes they devise elaborate ways for determining this. From early development, boys and men are more physically aggressive than girls and women all over the world, and this aggression sometimes results in violence. Men have a virtual monopoly on same-sex homicides. In other words, men are vastly more likely to kill each other than women are to kill each other. These are data from every society from every time period in history for which data were available when the authors compiled them, on proportion of same-sex homicides that are male killing male. And as you can see, the percentage is always close to 100%. On average, 95% of same-sex homicides are committed by males, and importantly, these don't include war killings, which would bring the percentages even closer to 100%. And from what evidence that we have, a dominance among men translates into mating and reproductive opportunities. So we're a species that's experienced an evolutionary history in which our male ancestors won mating opportunities through the use or threat of force. In that regard, our apple has not fallen far from the evolutionary tree. But in other ways, human mating and reproduction are profoundly different from what we see in our close relatives, and they've changed a lot since our early ancestors. For example, males in chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas, spend time and effort competing for mates, but don't spend much time with individual females and don't provide resources. They don't provide food for their offspring. So that's a big change. Although most human societies allow polygamous marriage, that is one man married to more than one woman, even within polygamous societies, most marriages are monogamous. And in the average hunter-gatherer society, almost 80% of married women are monogamous, so that's different. And, importantly, men provide resources for their mates and offspring. So how did we get there? Well, in species where males fight each other for mates, dominant males indicated by the larger, darker male symbols here, tend to have more mating opportunities, and hence more offspring. And subordinate males tend to have fewer mating opportunities and are more likely to fail to reproduce. So this sets up an interesting situation, because for subordinate males, it would be advantageous to attempt monogamy rather than winning lots of mating opportunities. One mate is better than none. The problem is that in general, subordinate males cannot defend females from dominant males, and besides, females tend to prefer mating with dominant males for the genetic benefits, producing stronger, healthier offspring. So what changed all of this was probably several transitions happening together around the same time. By about two and a half million years ago, we had started to incorporate more meat into our diet. We know this from various lines of evidence, including - this is cool - stone tool cut marks on animal bones dated to 2.5 million years ago. That's cool. I love this stuff! And then by about 2 million years ago, brain size really started to increase, and with that came a lengthening of the juvenile period, so now kids became both really costly and costly for a long period of time. And this made male provisioning both possible and necessary. Possible because it's much easier to bring back calories, protein, fats, in the form of meat than trying to do that by transporting plant foods, and necessary because kids became so energetically costly that individual females would have had trouble providing resources for themselves and their offspring. And when we look at modern hunter-gatherer societies, that's what we see. These are aggregate data across several hunter-gatherer societies on net daily calories. Are you bringing in more calories than you consume,  through foraging, or are you consuming more than you bring in? And the green bars are net daily caloric surplus, in other words, bringing in more than you consume. And the red bars are a deficit, so you're consuming more than you bring in. And you'll notice that men from about 20 years of age to 60 years of age are operating at a daily caloric surplus. They bring in, generally through hunting, more calories than they can consume, and these calories are distributed. If it's large game, it's generally distributed equally to everybody in the village or camp. Smaller items can be brought back to individual family, but this contrasts with what's going on with women, in their reproductive years, they're operating at a daily caloric deficit. Gestation, lactation, carrying babies, are extremely costly energetically and limit one's ability to forage efficiently. So male provisioning, both possible through hunting, and necessary. And this change had profound impacts on human mating and reproduction. In a sense, it tipped the balance for females. So now it was sometimes worth mating with a subordinate male, even if he may not possess the best genes, if he provided resources. And this is baboon pornography. (Laughter) I probably should have warned you there'd be monkey porn. This is from PlayBaboon Magazine.  Alright, I'm going to stop with the jokes. This is a female baboon in estrus, so her genitals are swollen, and this happens in a lot of primate species. Females' appearance changes over the cycle, and becomes more attractive and this incites male competition for females during the fertile part of the cycle, with dominant males tending to monopolize copulations, closer to ovulation. Well. We don't look like this. And you knew that. But what you might not know is that women's attractiveness does change over the cycle. My lab, and others, have shown that women's faces, voices, even odors, are more attractive to men during the fertile part of the cycle. But these changes are extremely subtle. And compared to other primates,  the evidence indicates that we've evolved to suppress cues to ovulation. That in a sense, ovulation is concealed in humans. But think about what impact this would have. This would mean that dominant males  would not be able to monopolize copulations near ovulation. It would protect the pair bond from invasion by a dominant male. So that a male in a pair would have more confidence that he was the father of the offspring. The couple is having sex throughout the cycle. And this is unique to human mating, we don't see it in many other primates. We have sex throughout the cycle. And so this would essentially increase a male's confidence in paternity, because a dominant or some other male wouldn't be able to target the female and bully their way in at the fertile point in the cycle. And this would have important implications for parental investment, in particular, males providing resources for their offspring. Because across species, when males provide resources for offspring, they target those resources toward their own biological offspring, and they avoid investing in the offspring of unrelated males. And so the evolution of male care for offspring and investing in resources and offspring, pair bonding, and concealed ovulation, went very much hand-in-hand over our evolution. We have also evolved a specialized psychology for forming long-term romantic relationships with the possibility of investing in offspring together. We fall in love. All around the world, people prefer mates who are kind and generous and capable and willing to care for mates and offspring. In one of the largest cross-cultural studies of human mate preferences ever conducted, covering 33 countries shown in red here, the single most important mate choice criterion to both men and women, was mutual love and attraction. But as you also know, people are not always perfectly faithful to their mates. And in particular, women sometimes face a tradeoff between good genes and investment. Women sometimes find themselves in relationships with men who may be caring providers, but may not possess the best quality genes for offspring making them strong and healthy. And several features of women's mating psychology seem to have evolved, in part, to resolve this trade off. And I mean, recruiting genes, if you will, from outside of the long-term relationship. For example, women have more sexual fantasies about men other than their long-term partner, during the fertile part of the cycle, and that's particularly true if the long-term partner has physical signs of being lower in genetic quality, like he's less physically attractive. I think that's interesting. (Laughter) That's why I'm talking about it, I hope you do too. And women's mate preferences similarly change over the cycle so that they prefer more dominant, more masculine males during the fertile part of the cycle. These are results of a study that I conducted on women's preferences for men's voices. And I used computer software to manipulate recordings of men's voices to make them sound either more masculine or more dominant, or more subordinate, more feminine. And I had women rate them on how attractive would this man be  for a short-term, purely sexual relationship, and for a long-term committed relationship? And I also got information about where women were in their cycles. Were they in the fertile or non-fertile part of the cycle? These were all women not taking hormonal contraception. And what I found was that women preferred a more masculine, dominant-sounding voice, specifically in the fertile point of the cycle, and only for a sexual relationship versus a long-term committed relationship. Now, this sounds like science fiction, but it's science, fact. Because this result has been shown lots of times across a variety of domains from women's preferences for men's voices, that this result was replicated by another lab. Women's preferences for men's faces, bodies, odors, and even behavior. Well, I said that we would get to orgasm. (Laughter) And we're there. I just want to start by saying I'm for it. (Laughter) I'm pro-orgasm. I think more people should have more orgasms. But from a scientific perspective, women's orgasm is especially fascinating because there's evidence indicating that it increases the probability that conception will result from an act of sex. There's evidence that it brings sperm up through the female reproductive tract and toward the egg. And think about what the implications here could be. If women were more likely to have orgasms with some men than others, then this could be a mechanism by which they choose, not consciously, to be fertilized by some males and not others. And wouldn't you predict that women would be more likely to have orgasms with males of high genetic quality? And in fact, a study by my lab published just a couple of years ago found that women reported more orgasms, earlier timed orgasms, that is, they were easier to achieve, they achieved them more quickly, when they were having sex when their mate was more masculine and more dominant, and what's interesting is that this was true only for their orgasms from sexual intercourse, but not from other partnered sexual behaviors. I'll let you use your imagination what those might be. So we've seen that thinking like an evolutionist can enable us to predict things about ourselves that we did not already know, and would not likely have guessed for a long time. We didn't know that women's mate preferences changed over the cycle. Until evolutionary thinking led us to that discovery. So that's one point that I want to make. But we've also seen how evolutionary thinking can clarify and unite diverse parts of the human experience, and help us understand the best and the worst of ourselves, from violence and aggression and infidelity to men's care for their children, sexual attraction, sexual pleasure, and even the strength and fragility of romantic love. Thank you.

Where does an artwork begin? Now sometimes that question is absurd. It can seem deceptively simple, as it was when I asked the question with this piece, ""Portable Planetarium,"" that I made in 2010. I asked the question: ""What would it look like to build a planetarium of one\'s own?"" I know you all ask that every morning, but I asked myself that question. And as an artist, I was thinking about our effort, our desire, our continual longing that we\'ve had over the years to make meaning of the world around us through materials. And for me, to try and find the kind of wonder, but also a kind of futility that lies in that very fragile pursuit, is part of my art work.', '00:58': ""So I bring together the materials I find around me, I gather them to try and create experiences, immersive experiences that occupy rooms, that occupy walls, landscapes, buildings. But ultimately, I want them to occupy memory. And after I've made a work, I find that there's usually one memory of that work that burns in my head. And this is the memory for me -- it was this sudden kind of surprising experience of being immersed inside that work of art. And it stayed with me and kind of reoccurred in my work about 10 years later."", '01:34': 'But I want to go back to my graduate school studio. I think it\'s interesting, sometimes, when you start a body of work, you need to just completely wipe the plate clean, take everything away. And this may not look like wiping the plate clean, but for me, it was. Because I had studied painting for about 10 years, and when I went to graduate school, I realized that I had developed skill, but I didn\'t have a subject. It was like an athletic skill, because I could paint the figure quickly, but I didn\'t know why. I could paint it well, but it didn\'t have content. And so I decided to put all the paints aside for a while, and to ask this question, which was: ""Why and how do objects acquire value for us?"" How does a shirt that I know thousands of people wear, a shirt like this one, how does it somehow feel like it\'s mine?', '02:25': 'So I started with that experiment, I decided, by collecting materials that had a certain quality to them. They were mass-produced, easily accessible, completely designed for the purpose of their use, not for their aesthetic. So things like toothpicks, thumbtacks, pieces of toilet paper, to see if in the way that I put my energy, my hand, my time into them, that the behavior could actually create a kind of value in the work itself. One of the other ideas is, I wanted the work to become live. So I wanted to take it off of the pedestal, not have a frame around it, have the experience not be that you came to something and told you that it was important, but that you discover that it was in your own time.', '03:08': 'So this is like a very, very old idea in sculpture, which is: How do we breathe life into inanimate materials? And so, I would go to a space like this, where there was a wall, and use the paint itself, pull the paint out off the wall, the wall paint into space to create a sculpture. Because I was also interested in this idea that these terms, ""sculpture,"" ""painting,"" ""installation"" -- none of these mattered in the way we actually see the world. So I wanted to blur those boundaries, both between mediums that artists talk about, but also blur the experience of being in life and being in art, so that when you are in your everyday, or when you are in one of my works, and you saw, you recognized the everyday, you could then move that experience into your own life, and perhaps see the art in everyday life.', '04:00': ""I was in graduate school in the '90s, and my studio just became more and more filled with images, as did my life. And this confusion of images and objects was really part of the way I was trying to make sense of materials. And also, I was interested in how this might change the way that we actually experience time. If we're experiencing time through materials, what happens when images and objects become confused in space? So I started by doing some of these experiments with images. And if you look back to the 1880s, that's when the first photographs started turning into film. And they were done through studies of animals, the movement of animals. So horses in the United States, birds in France. They were these studies of movement that then slowly, like zoetropes, became film."", '04:53': ""So I decided, I will take an animal and I'm going to play with that idea of how the image is not static for us anymore, it's moving. It's moving in space. And so I chose as my character the cheetah, because she is the fastest land-dwelling creature on earth. And she holds that record, and I want to use her record to actually make it kind of a measuring stick for time. And so this is what she looked like in the sculpture as she moved through space. This kind of broken framing of the image in space, because I had put up notepad paper and had it actually project on it. Then I did this experiment where you have kind of a race, with these new tools and video that I could play with. So the falcon moves out in front, the cheetah, she comes in second, and the rhino is trying to catch up behind."", '05:44': ""Then another one of the experiments, I was thinking about how, if we try and remember one thing that happened to us when we were, let's say, 10 years old. It's very hard to remember even what happened in that year. And for me, I can think of maybe one, maybe two, and that one moment has expanded in my mind to fill that entire year. So we don't experience time in minutes and seconds. So this is a still of the video that I took, printed out on a piece of paper, the paper is torn and then the video is projected on top of it. And I wanted to play with this idea of how, in this kind of complete immersion of images that's enveloped us, how one image can actually grow and can haunt us."", '06:33': ""So I had all of these -- these are three out of, like, 100 experiments I was trying with images for over about a decade, and never showing them, and I thought, OK, how do I bring this out of the studio, into a public space, but retain this kind of energy of experimentation that you see when you go into a laboratory, you see when you go into a studio, and I had this show coming up and I just said, alright, I'm going to put my desk right in the middle of the room. So I brought my desk and I put it in the room, and it actually worked in this kind of very surprising way to me, in that it was this kind of flickering, because of the video screens, from afar. And it had all of the projectors on it, so the projectors were creating the space around it, but you were drawn towards the flickering like a flame. And then you were enveloped in the piece at the scale that we're all very familiar with, which is the scale of being in front of a desk or a sink or a table, and you are immersed, then, back into this scale, this one-to-one scale of the body in relation to the image. But on this surface, you had these projections on paper being blown in the wind, so there was this confusion of what was an image and what was an object."", '07:46': ""So this is what the work looked like when it went into a larger room, and it wasn't until I made this piece that I realized that I'd effectively made the interior of a planetarium, without even realizing that. And I remembered, as a child, loving going to the planetarium. And back then, the planetarium, there was always not only these amazing images on the ceiling, but you could see the projector itself whizzing and burring, and this amazing camera in the middle of the room. And it was that, along with seeing the audience around you looking up, because there was an audience in the round at that time, and seeing them, and experiencing, being part of an audience. So this is an image from the web that I downloaded of people who took images of themselves in the work. And I like this image because you see how the figures get mixed with the work. So you have the shadow of a visitor against the projection, and you also see the projections across a person's shirt. So there were these self-portraits made in the work itself, and then posted, and it felt like a kind of cyclical image-making process. And a kind of an end to that."", '08:54': 'But it reminded me and brought me back to the planetarium, and that interior, and I started to go back to painting. And thinking about how a painting is actually, for me, about the interior images that we all have. There\'s so many interior images, and we\'ve become so focused on what\'s outside our eyes. And how do we store memory in our mind, how certain images emerge out of nowhere or can fall apart over time. And I started to call this series the ""Afterimage"" series, which was a reference to this idea that if we all close our eyes right now, you can see there\'s this flickering light that lingers, and when we open it again, it lingers again -- this is happening all the time. And an afterimage is something that a photograph can never replace, you never feel that in a photograph. So it really reminds you of the limits of the camera\'s lens. So it was this idea of taking the images that were outside of me -- this is my studio -- and then trying to figure out how they were being represented inside me.', '09:56': 'So really quickly, I\'m just going to whiz through how a process might develop for the next piece. So it might start with a sketch, or an image that\'s burned in my memory from the 18th century -- it\'s Piranesi\'s ""Colosseum."" Or a model the size of a basketball -- I built this around a basketball, the scale\'s evidenced by the red cup behind it. And that model can be put into a larger piece as a seed, and that seed can grow into a bigger piece. And that piece can fill a very, very large space. But it can funnel down into a video that\'s just made from my iPhone, of a puddle outside my studio in a rainy night. So this is an afterimage of the painting made in my memory, and even that painting can fade as memory does.', '10:46': ""So this is the scale of a very small image from my sketchbook. You can see how it can explode to a subway station that spans three blocks. And you could see how going into the subway station is like a journey through the pages of a sketchbook, and you can see sort of a diary of work writ across a public space, and you're turning the pages of 20 years of art work as you move through the subway. But even that sketch actually has a different origin, it has an origin in a sculpture that climbs a six-story building, and is scaled to a cat from the year 2002. I remember that because I had two black cats at the time. And this is an image of a work from Japan that you can see the afterimage of in the subway. Or a work in Venice, where you see the image etched in the wall. Or how a sculpture that I did at SFMOMA in 2001, and created this kind of dynamic line, how I stole that to create a dynamic line as you descend down into the subway itself."", '11:52': ""And this merging of mediums is really interesting to me. So how can you take a line that pulls tension like a sculpture and put it into a print? Or then use line like a drawing in a sculpture to create a dramatic perspective? Or how can a painting mimic the process of printmaking? How can an installation use the camera's lens to frame a landscape? How can a painting on string become a moment in Denmark, in the middle of a trek? And how, on the High Line, can you create a piece that camouflages itself into the nature itself and becomes a habitat for the nature around it?"", '12:33': 'And I\'ll just end with two pieces that I\'m making now. This is a piece called ""Fallen Sky"" that\'s going to be a permanent commission in Hudson Valley, and it\'s kind of the planetarium finally come down and grounding itself in the earth. And this is a work from 2013 that\'s going to be reinstalled, have a new life in the reopening of MOMA. And it\'s a piece that the tool itself is the sculpture. So the pendulum, as it swings, is used as a tool to create the piece. So each of the piles of objects go right up to one centimeter to the tip of that pendulum. So you have this combination of the lull of that beautiful swing, but also the tension that it constantly could destroy the piece itself.', '13:20': ""And so, it doesn't really matter where any of these pieces end up, because the real point for me is that they end up in your memory over time, and they generate ideas beyond themselves."", '13:34': 'Thank you.', '13:35': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have. But what started off as momentary curiosity very quickly turned into an almost five-year horrific battle that almost ruined my life. I Google Images reverse-searched myself: a function of Google that allows you to upload an image and it shows you where it is on the internet. This is me at 17 years old. An innocent selfie I took before a party.', '00:53': ""Now, before I continue, I must point out that what I'm about to talk about is very confronting and graphic. But there's no way out. This is a very confronting issue."", '01:07': 'In a split second, my screen was flooded with that image and dozens more images of me that had been stolen from my social media, on links connected to porn sites. On these sites, nameless, faceless sexual predators had published highly explicit sexual commentary about me and what they\'d like to do to me. ""Cover her face and we\'d fuck her body,"" one person wrote. They also published identifying information about me: where I lived, what I studied, who I was.', '01:54': 'But things got worse. I soon discovered that these sexual predators had doctored or photoshopped my face onto the bodies of naked adult actresses engaged in sexual intercourse, on solo shots of me being ejaculated on by two men. Sperm was edited onto my face. I was edited onto the cover of a porn DVD. Perpetrators had edited my images to give the effect that my blouse was transparent or see-through, so you could see my nipples. Perpetrators ejaculated on images of me, took photos of their sperm and penises on these images and posted them onto porn sites. ""Cum on printed pigs,"" is what they call it.', '02:59': 'Now, you might be wondering, what sorts of images I posted on social media. This is me, at around 19 at the Claremont Hotel, just a few suburbs away. And they superimposed that face into this. And things got worse. Nothing was off limits for these predators. They even posted an image with my little sister on these sites too.', '03:29': 'Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, you do dress provocatively, even a little sexually suggestive, attention seeking maybe."" But just because a woman\'s body gets attention, doesn\'t mean she\'s attention-seeking. And what is provocative anyway, what is sexually suggestive? In some parts of the world, showing your ankles is promiscuous, is provocative. It\'s just like, no matter what a woman wears, it\'s always perceived as more sexual than it is. For me, I just wanted to feel pretty and confident. What\'s so wrong with that?', '04:16': 'Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, can\'t you just set your social media on private?"" Well, these perpetrators were calculated. They befriended my friends on social media under fake profiles, they followed the public galleries of the events and places I regularly visited.', '04:41': ""But why? Why should one have to retreat and hide out of fear that something like this could happen? What I post and what I wear isn't an invitation to violate and abuse me. The only person that should be changing their behavior is the perpetrators."", '05:04': '(Applause)', '05:16': ""Now, you might be thinking, why me? Well, I'm just one of the thousands upon thousands of ordinary women who are being preyed upon in these mass-scale, horrific online cultures, websites and threads that are dedicated to sexually exploiting and doctoring ordinary images of women into porn. As I speak, there are women who are being preyed upon, and they don't even know it."", '05:55': 'In the beginning, I tried seeking help. I went to police, I contacted government agencies, I even tried to hire a private investigator, but they were too expensive. There was nothing that they could do. I mean, what could you do when the sites are hosted overseas and the perpetrators are from overseas? I was told I had to contact the sites one by one, notifying the webmasters to get everything deleted. And so as you can imagine, in complete and utter fear and pain, I did.', '06:41': ""I contacted the webmasters, requesting that they delete the material shared without consent. And I had some successes, but I also had some major setbacks. The more I fought, the more sites I would discover, and with time, the more my images were being seen and shared in the tens of thousands. I had one webmaster respond to me saying he'll only delete the site if I sent him nude photos of myself within 24 hours."", '07:21': ""And this went on for years, fighting against these dodgy, disgusting sites. But I was fighting a losing battle. And I couldn't continue this any longer for my own mental health. But what could I do?"", '07:40': 'Maybe, I thought, if I spoke out, I could reclaim my name, and I could rewrite my narrative on my own terms. Maybe if I spoke out, I could raise awareness about this. Maybe I could even try to change the law. And so I did.', '08:04': '(Applause)', '08:14': 'I spoke out publicly late last year and news of my story reverberated around the world. But this was the response. ""She\'s a fat, ugly slut, she\'s a whore."" ""She\'s an attention-seeking piece of trash."" ""Feel flattered, baby, it\'s a compliment."" I was victim-blamed and slut-shamed and told I was deserving of what happened to me. And quite frankly, that was more difficult for me to endure than my actual experiences of image-based abuse.', '08:51': ""But I couldn’t let this criticism defeat me. I knew what the perpetrators had done was wrong, and I knew what they were doing to others was wrong. And so I petitioned. I sent out impassioned pleas for support. But it didn't work. I think I got like 330 signatures. And that was really disheartening."", '09:17': ""But I then contacted my state and federal MPs. And I was referred to the New South Wales Attorney General's department, who were already in the process of drafting new laws to criminalize the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images. Image-based sexual abuse. Some of you might know it as revenge porn. And soon I became a spokesperson, a public face for the new laws. But I must point out, I do not in any way, shape or form want to take credit for this change in the law. This is on the backs of cybersafety experts, of researchers, of the Attorney General's department, of so many people who have fought for years. New South Wales was the first state in all the world to specifically include a provision on altering images. Something that happened to me, something you certainly don't hear about very often. And now ACT has also criminalized this, also with a provision on altered images. And next year, WA is introducing legislation and hopefully, they introduce a provision on altered images and I urge every state and every country in this world to follow suit, because right now, there's no justice for people like me."", '10:46': ""Despite it all, despite the hate and despite the criticism, despite the fact that I'm never going to get justice, because my experiences happened before this movement of law reform, speaking out was the best thing I've ever done, because I know for a fact that it has helped people. And I just want to live in a world where, regardless of what I wear or what I post, that I'm still worthy of being treated with dignity and respect. Respect. Now, that's an idea worth sharing."", '11:28': '(Applause)', '11:29': 'Thank you.', '11:31': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many in here have heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before? Let's see a show of hands. OK, that's practically everybody. Probably due to the fact that we are Sweden's neighbor."", '00:54': ""I frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to this first question which is one-half to two-thirds. This is actually the first time ever that does not match. It was practically everybody."", '01:08': ""So, for those who haven't heard of us: well, the Pirate Party, we love the net. We love copying and sharing, and we love civil liberties. For that, some people call us pirates. Probably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame. That didn't work very well. We decided to stand tall about it instead."", '01:31': ""And so in 2006, I founded a new political party. I led it for its first five years. And the European elections, the last European elections, we became the largest party and the most coveted youth demographic, sub-30. And what's interesting is we did that on less than one percent of the competition's budget. We had a campaign budget total of 50,000 euros. They had six million between them -- and we beat them. That gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude. And I'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that."", '02:19': ""We developed swarm methodologies. And they can be applied to any business or social cause. Well, almost any -- there's a small asterisk by the end, and I'll get to that in just a minute. But applying these -- and we've done this dozens of times, we know that this works."", '02:41': ""We've put two people in the European Parliament, we have 45 people in various German state parliaments, we're in the Icelandic parliament, the Czech senate, many, many, many more, local councils -- and, as said, we've spread to 70 countries. And that's not bad for a political movement that hasn't even been around for a decade."", '03:01': ""So today we're going to talk a bit about -- how people are motivated to be part of change, to be part of something bigger than themselves. And how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power of wanting to make the world a better place. And in the end, come out a little on the better."", '03:32': ""When I speak to businesspeople, I frequently make them very upset when I contradict them and say that no, your employees are not your most valuable asset.

But it works! What you need to do is to put a stake in the ground. You need to announce your goal. Just say, ""I want to accomplish this."" I\'m going to do this. And it doesn\'t need to be very costly.', '04:52': 'My announcement was just two lines in a chat channel. ""Hey, look, the Pirate Party has its website up now after New Year\'s."" And the address. That was all the advertising I ever did. The next time I had several hundred activists wanting to work with us.', '05:10': ""When you provide such a focus point, a swarm intelligence emerges. When people can rally to a flag. And that's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency. It's a huge advantage -- you're running circles around all the legacy organizations. And there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal in order for this to work."", '05:38': 'These four criteria are that your goal must be: tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.', '05:49': 'Let\'s take a look at them: It needs to be tangible. A lot of people say, ""Well, you know, we should make the world a better place,"" or, ""Yeah, we should all feel good now."" Not going to work. You need a binary. Are we there yet, or are we not there yet?', '06:08': ""It needs to be credible. Somebody seeing the project plan that you're posting needs to see that, yes, this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be. You need to break it down into subgoals that each by themselves are seen as doable, and when you add the subgoals together, we've gone to where we want."", '06:27': 'It needs to be -- and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working swarmwise -- it needs to be inclusive. Anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say, ""I want to do this -- and there\'s my spot!"" And they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody\'s permission. And that is exactly what\'ll happen.', '06:55': ""And, last but not least, it needs to be epic. It needs to energize people. It needs to electrify people. Shoot for the moon! On second thought, don't shoot for the moon, we've already been there -- shoot for Mars!"", '07:12': '(Laughter)', '07:16': ""In contrast, you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming around making the most correct tax audit ever. Doesn't electrify people. Go to Mars."", '07:34': ""A lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles. We're going to climb a huge mountain. So how do you motivate people to do that? Well, it turns out that obstacles are not the problem. Not knowing the obstacles is the problem. If you know how high the mountain is, you know exactly what it takes to scale it. We know exactly how far away Mars is and what it takes to get there. If you can plan it like a project, you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it, exactly like a project."", '08:05': ""Let's see: we're going to Mars, we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists, one dozen volunteer metallurgists, some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard and so on."", '08:19': 'When you can list the resources, you know what you need to get there. When you know what you need to get there, you can go there. And the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence, which is where the cost efficiency comes in.', '08:38': ""There's a TED Talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money, and it presents science on how we're really motivated by three things, in terms of larger creative tasks, when we work for something bigger than ourselves."", '08:56': ""We work for autonomy, mastery and purpose. We've covered purpose already. As in, working for something bigger, tangible, credible, inclusive and epic. So, where that motivation talk ends, what it doesn't answer is, how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power. And this is where working swarmwise comes in, this is where swarm intelligence comes in. Turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for -- and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school. But it works. We know it works. We have people in many, many parliaments to prove it."", '09:47': ""Those three factors are: speed, trust and scalability. We optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop, cutting them out of the decision loop. That means cutting yourself out of the decision loop, which can be hard. But you've got to communicate your vision so passionately, so strongly, that everybody knows what the goal is and can find something, some step that takes the movement just a little closer to that goal. And when tens of thousands of people do that on a weekly basis, you become an unstoppable force."", '10:29': 'We had a three-person rule in our organization, saying that if three self-identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement, they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the organization, including spending resources. When you talk about this kind of empowerment to traditional businesspeople, they think you belong in a zoo. But you know what? I led this organization for five years, there were 50,000 registered members and many, many more anonymous activists. It was not abused once. Everybody had the key to the treasure chest. It was not abused one single time.', '11:14': 'Turns out when you give people the keys to the castle, and look them in the eye and say, ""I trust you,"" they step up to the plate. And that\'s a beautiful thing to see happen.', '11:28': ""Obviously, not everything went according to plan, but that's a different thing. We made mistakes. We should expect mistakes. If you're pioneering something, that means you must, by definition, venture into the unknown. When you're trying the unknown, some things won't go as planned. That's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown. To find the great, you must allow mistakes to happen. So you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a risk-positive environment. Therefore we optimize for iteration speed. Meaning that we try, we fail, we try again, we fail faster, we fail better, we try again, we fail better again. Maybe after we've tried 15 times, we've mastered some specific subject, so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those 15 times."", '12:20': ""We optimize on trust. We encourage diversity. You need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context because language is an incredibly strong inclusionary and exclusionary social marker. This one-brand-fits-all message -- forget it! That's what they teach you at business school -- it doesn't work. Or at least, it doesn't give you the cost-efficiency advantage of working swarmwise."", '12:57': ""This leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel in different social groups who try out different methods of working toward the goal. Some of them will work but in order to find the great ones, you need this diversity. And you need to communicate that we need that diversity. If somebody on this side does not understand what those guys are doing, that's OK because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement. And it's OK that I don't understand their social context. I'm not expected to -- I understand my social context. I contribute with something I know. Make people aware of this diversity."", '13:35': ""Finally, scalability. Get feet on the ground. Again, in business school, they teach you to use a lean organization. Forget that. Just scale up the organization from the get-go. Start with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city. When you have lots and lots of small responsibilities in such a scaffolding that supports the swarm, supports the activists, you'll find that these boxes in the org charts are getting filled in quite rapidly, and they start to get filled in beyond your horizon with people you've never heard of. And so, this swarm keeps growing to tens of thousands of people, each taking on something small with very, very decentralized mandate to act on the organization. And this is when a swarm intelligence emerges. This is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what's to be done. Everybody is taking their own small steps towards it. So the swarm starts to act as a coherent organism. And it's amazing to watch. This is when you're awarded by the cost-efficiency advantage over your competitors by two orders of magnitude. Two orders of magnitude. This is not just a silver bullet."", '15:05': ""So we've been talking a lot about the big picture today. You can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff. Do you want to change the world? Do you want to bring clean water to a billion people? Teach three billion people to read? Maybe you're into social change; you want to introduce unconditional basic income. Or maybe you want to take humanity to Mars. You can do this using these methods."", '15:27': ""You can do this. It's about leadership. It's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world. Because no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world, no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world, you are probably right."", '15:52': ""So one question I want everybody here to ask themselves today is the observation that change doesn't just happen, somebody makes it happen -- do you want to be that person? Do you want to be that person?"", '16:10': ""And then one last thing: There's one component more that's required to work swarmwise that I haven't mentioned yet. And that is fun. This goes beyond just enjoying your job, this goes beyond having a pinball machine in the office. Because this is actually required to succeed in a swarmwise scenario. This is required to succeed to get that cost-efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude. For the reason that you need to attract volunteers. And people, in this aspect, are rather predictable. People will go to other people who are having fun. In contrast, they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun. So, having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office. It's an absolute and unavoidable requirement for organizational and operational success when you're working swarmwise."", '17:27': 'So, in summary -- a recipe for a swarm organization using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage. Your goal: it needs to be tangible, credible, inclusive and epic. Your organization needs to be optimized for speed, trust and scalability. You need to enjoy yourselves. And that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost-efficiency advantage.', '18:05': 'Thank you.', '18:07': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aleph Molinari empowers digitally excluded people, by giving them access to computers and sharing the know-how to use them.",0:09:46,9.766666667,221532,2012-02-04T15:01:38+00:00,"['TEDx', 'global issues', 'poverty', 'technology']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'Українська', 'العربية', 'हिन्दी', 'ภาษาไทย', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Aleph Molinari,"Economist, techno-activist","{'00:05': 'The digital divide is a mother that\'s 45 years old and can\'t get a job, because she doesn\'t know how to use a computer. It is an immigrant that doesn\'t know that he can call his family for free. It is a child who can\'t resolve his homework, because he doesn\'t have access to information. The digital divide is a new illiteracy. ""Digital divide"" is also defined as: the gap between individuals and communities that have access to information technologies and those that don\'t.', '00:31': ""Why does this happen? It happens because of 3 things. The first is that people can't get access to these technologies because they can't afford them. The second is because they don't know how to use them. The third is because they don't know the benefits derived from technology. So let's consider some very basic statistics. The population of the world is nearly seven billion people. Out of these, approximately two billion are digitally included. This is approximately 30% of the entire world population, which means that the remaining 70% of the world -- close to five billion people -- do not have access to a computer or the internet. Let's think about that number for a second. Five billion people; that's four times the population of India, that have never touched a computer, have never accessed the internet. So this is a digital abyss that we're talking about, this is not a digital divide."", '01:24': ""Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison that shows the internet connections around the world. What we can see is that most of the internet connections are centered on North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is engulfed in the dark shadow of digital divide. Next, we can see connections, city-to-city, around the world, and we can see that most of the information generated is being generated between North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is not broadcasting their ideas or information. So what does this mean? We are living in a world that seems to be having a digital revolution, a revolution that everyone here thinks that we're part of, but the 70% of the world that is digitally excluded is not part of this."", '02:06': ""What does this mean? Well, the people that will be digitally excluded won't be able to compete in the labor markets of the future, they won't be connected, they'll be less informed, they'll be less inspired and they'll be less responsible. Internet should not be a luxury, it should be a right, because it is a basic social necessity of the 21st century. We can't operate without it."", '02:27': '(Applause)', '02:29': 'Thank you.', '02:30': 'It allows us to connect to the world. It empowers us. It gives us social participation. It is a tool for change. And so, how are we going to bridge this digital divide? Well, there are many models that try and bridge the digital divide, that try and include the population at large. But the question is: Are they really working?', '02:54': ""I'm sure everybody here knows One Laptop per Child, where one computer is given to one child. The problem with this is, do we really want children to take computers to their homes, homes that have adverse conditions? And we also must understand that by giving a child a computer, we're also transferring costs, very high costs, such as internet connection, electricity, maintenance, software, updates. So we must create different models, models that help the families rather than add a burden on them. Also, let's not forget about the carbon footprint. Imagine five billion laptops. What would the world look like then? Imagine the hazardous residue that would be generated from that. Imagine the trash. So if we give one computer to one person, and we multiply that times five billion, even if that laptop is a hundred dollars, then we would have 483 trillion dollars. Now let's consider we're only counting the youth, ages 10 to 24. That's approximately 30% of the digitally excluded population. Then that would be 145 trillion dollars. What nation has this amount of money? This is not a sustainable model."", '04:06': 'So with this in mind, we created a different model. We created the RIA, in Spanish, or in English, Learning and Innovation Network, which is a network of community centers that bring education through the use of technology. We wanted to increase the number of users per computer in such a way that we could dilute the cost of infrastructure, the cost per user, and that we could bring education and technology to everybody within these communities.', '04:30': ""Let's look at a basic comparison. The RIA has 1,650 computers. If we had used the One Laptop per Child model of a 1 to 1 ratio, then we would have benefited 1,650 users. What we did instead is set up centers that have longer hours of operation than schools, that also include all of the population -- our youngest user is 3 years old, the oldest is 86 -- and with this, in less than two years, we were able to reach 140,000 users, out of which --"", '05:05': '(Applause)', '05:07': 'Thank you.', '05:08': 'out of which, 34,000 have already graduated from our courses.', '05:12': 'Another thing with One Laptop per Child is that it doesn\'t guarantee the educational use of a computer. Technology is nothing without that content. We need to use it as a means, not as an end. How did we accomplish such a high impact? Well, you can\'t just go into a community and pretend to change it, you need to look at a lot of factors. So what we do is a thing we call ""urban acupuncture."" We first start by looking at the basic geography of a site. So take, for example, Ecatepec. This is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Mexico. It has a very low income level. So we look at the basic geography, we look at roads, streets, the flux of pedestrians and vehicles. Then we look at income, we look at education. Then we set up a center there in the place that\'s going to heal the body, a little needle to change the city body. And there we go.', '06:09': ""And so, there are four basic elements that we need to consider when we're using education through technology. The first one is we need to create spaces. We need to create a space that is welcoming to the community, a space that is according to the needs of the children and of the elders and of every possible person that lives within that community. So we create these spaces that are all made with recycled materials. We use modular architecture to lower the ecological impact."", '06:42': ""And second, connection. By connection, I mean not only a connection to the internet, that's too easy. We need to create a connection that's an interconnection of humans. The internet is a very complex organism that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts and the emotions of human beings. We need to create networks that aid in exchanging information."", '07:07': ""Third, content. Education is nothing without content. And you can't pretend to have a relationship of only a computer with a child. So we create a route, a very basic learning route, where we teach people how to use a computer, how to use the internet, how to use office software, and in 72 hours, we create digital citizens. You can't pretend that people are just going to touch a computer and become digitally included, you need to have a process. And after this, then they can take on a longer educational route."", '07:39': ""And then fourth, training. We need to train not only the users, but we need to train the people that will facilitate learning for these people. When you're talking about the digital divide, people have stigmas, people have fears; people don't understand how it can complement their lives. So what we do is train facilitators so that they can help in breaking that digital barrier."", '08:03': ""So, we have four elements: we have a space that's created, we have a connection, we have content and we have training. We have created a digital learning community. But there is one more element, which is the benefits that technology can create, because it is not printed, static content. It is dynamic; it is modifiable. So we have we do is, we provide content, then we do training, then we analyze the user patterns so that we can improve content. So it creates a virtuous circle. It allows us to deliver education according to different types of intelligence and according to different user needs. With this in mind, we have to think that technology is something that can modify according to human processes."", '08:51': 'I want to share a story. In 2006, I went to live here. This is one of the poorest communities in all of Mexico. I went to film a documentary on the people that live off trash, entirely of trash -- their houses are built with trash, they eat trash, they dress in trash. And after two months of living with them, of seeing the children and the way they work, I understood that the only thing that can change and that can break the poverty cycle is education. And we can use technology to bring education to these communities. Here is another shot.', '09:23': ""The main message is that technology is not going to save the world; we are, and we can use technology to help us. I'm sure everybody here has experienced it; what moves technology is human energy. So let's use this energy to make the world a better place."", '09:42': 'Thank you.', '09:43': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now,Open science now!,What if every scientist could share their data as easily as they tweet about their lunch? Michael Nielsen calls for scientists to embrace new tools for collaboration that will enable discoveries to happen at the speed of Twitter.,0:16:14,16.23333333,221098,2011-11-13T15:07:44+00:00,"['Internet', 'TEDx', 'collaboration', 'open-source', 'science', 'technology', 'crowdsourcing', 'data']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Русский', 'Українська', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'ภาษาไทย', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '한국어']",Michael Nielsen,Physicist,"{'00:09': ""Well, good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all very much for coming along today. I'd like to begin my talk with a story. It's a story that begins, but does not end, with a mathematician named Tim Gowers. Gowers is one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. He's a professor at Cambridge University and a recipient of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize of mathematics. Gowers is also a blogger, and in January of 2009, he used his blog to pose a very striking question: Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?"", '00:51': 'So what he was proposing in this post was to use his blog to attack a difficult unsolved mathematical problem -- a problem which he said he would ""love to solve"" -- completely in the open, using his blog to post his ideas and his partial progress. What\'s more, he issued an open invitation, inviting anybody in the world who thought that they had an idea to contribute to post their idea in the comment section of the blog. His hope was that by combining the ideas of many minds, he could make easy work of his hard mathematical problem. He called this experiment the Polymath Project.', '01:34': 'Well, the Polymath Project got off to a slow start. In the first seven hours, nobody posted any comments. But then, a mathematician from the University of British Columbia named Jozsef Solymosi posted a short comment. And this seemed to break the ice, because a few minutes later, a high school teacher named Jason Dyer posted a suggestion. And a few minutes after that, another mathematician named Terence Tao, also a Fields medalist, posted an idea. And things really started to move quickly at this point. Over the next 37 days, 27 different people would post 800 substantive comments containing 170,000 words. I was not a serious participant, but I was following along closely from the start, and it was just amazing. The speed with which an idea would be tentatively proposed and then really rapidly developed by other people and improved, sometimes discarded -- it was just amazing. Gowers described the process as being to ordinary research ""as driving is to pushing a car.""', '02:38': '(Laughter)', '02:40': ""At the end of the 37 days, Gowers used his blog to announce that they had solved the core problem; in fact, they had solved a harder generalization of the problem. The Polymath Project had succeeded. So what the Polymath Project suggests, at least to me, is that we can use the internet to build tools that actually expand our ability to solve the most challenging intellectual problems. Or, to put it in another way: we can build tools which actively amplify our collective intelligence in much the same way as, for millennia, we've used physical tools to amplify our strength. OK? So what I'd like to talk about today, or what I'd like to explore today, is what this means for science. It's much more important than just solving a single mathematical problem. It means an expansion in the range of scientific problems we can hope to attack at all. It means, potentially, an acceleration in the rate of scientific discovery. It means a change in the way we construct knowledge itself."", '03:48': 'So, before I get too overexcited, however, I would like to talk about some of the challenges, some of the problems. Particularly, I\'d like to describe a failure of this approach. It occurred in 2005, or started in 2005. A grad student at Caltech named John Stockton had a very good idea for what he called the ""Quantum Wiki,"" or ""Qwiki"" for short.', '04:14': '(Laughter)', '04:15': ""OK? It's a great idea. What he did with the Qwiki was -- the idea of the Qwiki was that it was going to be a great repository of human knowledge, much like Wikipedia. But instead of being focused on general knowledge, it was going to be focused on specialist knowledge in quantum computing. It was going be kind of a supertextbook for the field, with information about all the latest research, about what the big open problems in the field were, people's speculation about how to solve the problems, and so on. Like Wikipedia, the intention was that it would be written by the users, in this case, by experts in quantum computing. I was present at the conference at Caltech in 2005, when it was announced. And some of the people who I spoke to were very skeptical, but some of the people were very excited by the idea. They were impressed by the implementation; they were impressed by the amount of initial seed material which had been put on the site; and most of all, they were excited by the vision. But just because they were excited, didn't mean they wanted to take the time themselves to contribute. They hoped that other people would do so. And in the end, nobody, essentially, was really all that interested in contributing. If you look today, except in a few small corners, the Qwiki is essentially dead."", '05:35': ""And, sad to say, this is quite a common story. Many scientists, in fields ranging from genetics to string theory, have tried to start science wikis along very similar lines. And typically, they've failed for essentially the same reason. It's not just science wikis, either. Inspired by Facebook, many organizations have tried to create social networks for scientists, which will connect scientists to other people with similar interests. So they can share things like data or code, their ideas and so on. Again, it sounds like a good idea. But if you join one of these sites, you'll quickly discover that they're essentially empty. They're virtual ghost towns. So what's going on? What's the problem here? Why are these promising sites failing?"", '06:23': ""Well, imagine that you're an ambitious young scientist. In fact, I know some of you here are ambitious young scientists. Imagine you're an ambitious young scientist. You really would like to get a job -- a permanent job, a good job -- doing the work that you love. But it's incredibly competitive to get such jobs. Often, there'll be hundreds of very highly qualified applicants for positions. And so you find yourself working 60, 70, 80 hours a week, doing the one thing that you know will get you such a job, and that is writing scientific papers. You may think that the Qwiki is a wonderful idea in principle, but you also know that writing a single mediocre paper will do much more for your career and your job prospects than a long series of brilliant contributions to such a site. So even though you may like the idea and you may think it will advance science more quickly, you find you just can't conceive of it as being part of your job. It's not."", '07:24': ""The only things which can succeed in this kind of environment are projects like the Polymath Project, which, even though they employ an unconventional means to an end, they have an essential conservatism about them. The end product of the Polymath Project was still a scientific paper. In fact, it was several papers. Right? So unconventional means, but conventional ends. So there's a kind of conservatism about it. And don't get me wrong -- the Polymath Project is terrific, but it is a pity that scientists can only use tools which have this kind of conservative nature."", '08:02': ""So let me tell you a story about an instance where we moved away from this conservatism. It's a rare story where the conservatism has been broken. It occurred in the 1990s, when, as you know, for the first time, biologists were taking large amounts of genetic data to collect in the Human Genome Project. And there were sites online which would allow biologists to upload that data so it could be shared with other people around the world and analyzed by other people. Probably the best known of these is the site GenBank, which some of you may have heard of or used. And these sites, like GenBank, had the problem in common with Qwiki that scientists -- they're not paid or rewarded for sharing their data. It's all about publishing papers. So there was a considerable reluctance to actually upload the data. Yet, everybody could see that this was silly -- it was obvious that this was the right thing to do. But just because it was obvious didn't mean that people were actually doing it."", '09:06': ""So a meeting was convened in Bermuda in 1996 of many of the world's leading molecular biologists. And they sat and they discussed the problem for several days, and they came up with what are now called the Bermuda Principles, which state that: first, once human genetic data is taken in the lab, it should be immediately uploaded to a site like GenBank; and two, that the data would be in the public domain. And these principles were given teeth, because they were taken by the big scientific grant agencies -- the US National Institutes of Health, the UK Wellcome Trust -- and actually baked into policy. So it meant that if you were a scientist who wanted to work on the human genome, you had to agree to abide by these principles. And today, I'm very pleased to say, as a result, you can go online -- anybody here -- and download the human genome."", '09:58': 'So that\'s a terrific story. But the human genome is just a tiny, tiny fraction of all scientific knowledge. Even just in other parts of genetics, there is so much knowledge that is still locked up. I spoke with one bioinformatician who told me that he\'d been ""sitting on the genome of an entire species for more than a year."" An entire species. And in other parts of science, it is routine that scientists hoard their data. They hoard the computer code that they write that could be useful, potentially, to other people. They hoard their best ideas. And they often hoard even the descriptions of the problems that they think are most interesting. And so, what I and other people in the Open Science movement would like to do is, we\'d like to change this situation. We would like to change the culture of science so that scientists become much more strongly motivated to share all of these different kinds of knowledge. We want to change the values of individual scientists so they start to see it as part of their job to be sharing their data, to be sharing their code, to be sharing their best ideas and their problems. So, if we can do this, this kind of change in values, then we will indeed start to see individual scientists rewarded for doing these things; there will be incentives to do them.', '11:24': ""It's a difficult thing to do, however. We're talking about changing the culture of entire large parts of science. But it has happened before once in history, right back at the dawn of science. Galileo, 1609: he points his telescope up at the sky towards Saturn, and he sees for the first time in history what we now know are the rings of Saturn. Does he tell everybody in the world? No, he doesn't do that. He writes down a description, privately, and then he scrambles the letters in the description into an anagram, and he sends that anagram to several of his astronomer rivals."", '12:06': '(Laughter)', '12:07': ""And what this ensures is that, if they later make the same discovery, he can reveal the anagram and get the credit, but in the meantime, he hasn't given up any knowledge at all. And I'm sad to say that he was not uncommon at the time: Newton, Huygens, Hooke, Leonardo -- they all used similar devices. OK? The printing press had been around for 150 years by this time. And yet, there was a great battle in the 17th and 18th centuries to change the culture of science, so that it became expected that when a scientist made a discovery, they would reveal it in a journal."", '12:50': ""Now, that's great that that change has happened. It's terrific. But today, we have new technologies, we have new opportunities to share our knowledge in new ways and the ability to create tools that actually allow us to solve problems in entirely new ways. So we need to have a second open science revolution. It is my belief that any publicly funded science should be open science."", '13:18': ""How can we achieve this change? Well, if you're a scientist -- and I know many of you are not scientists, but if you are a scientist, then there are things that you can do. You can get involved in an open science project, even if it's just for a small fraction of your time. You can find forums online where you can share your knowledge in new ways, ways that allow other people to build on that knowledge. You can also, if you're more ambitious, start an open science project of your own. If you're really bold, you may wish to experiment with entirely new ways of collaborating, in much the same way as the Polymath Project did. But above all, what you should do is be very generous in giving credit to those of your colleagues who are practicing science in the open and to promote their work. It is only conservative scientific values that look down on these activities -- the sharing of data, the blogging, or using of wikis and so on. You can reject those conservative values and engage your scientific colleagues in conversation to promote the value of these new ways of working, to emphasize that it takes bravery to do these things, particularly by young scientists. It's through such conversation that the culture of science can be changed."", '14:42': ""So if you are not a scientist, there are also things that you can do. My belief is that the single most important thing that we can do to give impetus to open science is to create a general awareness amongst the population of the issue of open science and of its critical importance. If there is that general awareness, then the scientific community will inevitably find -- it will be dragged by the population at large in the right direction. There are simple things you can do. You can talk to your friends and acquaintances who are scientists and just ask them what are they doing to work more openly. Or you can use your imagination and your personal power to raise awareness in other ways. We're talking about changing not just what scientists do but what grant agencies do, what universities do and what governments do. And you can influence all of those things."", '15:40': 'Our society faces a fundamental question: What kinds of knowledge are we going to expect and incentivize our scientists to share? Will we continue as we have done in the past? Or will we embrace new kinds of sharing, which lead to new methods for solving problems and an acceleration in the process of science, entirely across the board? My hope is that we will embrace open science and really seize this opportunity that we have to reinvent discovery itself.', '16:17': 'Thank you.

Jason would have to tread carefully to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly one of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate this difficult task alone. Or so he thought.', '00:42': 'Leaving most of his bedraggled crew to rest, Jason made for the palace with some of his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask the king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged at the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth by facing three perilous tasks.', '01:06': 'The trials would begin the following day, and Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family was also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement of Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis and priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved from her father’s tricks — at any cost.', '01:33': 'After a sleepless night, Jason somberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him with strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise of eternal devotion. As they whispered and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply under each other’s spell.', '01:54': 'Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason to face his first task. The hero was brought to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields unscathed.', '02:21': 'For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray.', '02:49': 'For the third task, Jason was finally face to face with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece off its branch.', '03:20': 'When the king saw the hero sprinting away— not only with the fleece, but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize and his conniving daughter home.', '03:37': 'But all the players in this tale had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father while the Argonauts escaped.', '03:58': 'As Colchis and their pursuers grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them.

I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he\'s lying there and he says, ""I really understand, and I really appreciate how one should love one\'s neighbor as one love\'s oneself. The only trouble is the people next door; I can\'t stand them."" This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.', '00:49': ""We all, I think, believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah, that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel, who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God, who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman. After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate? And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life? Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control."", '02:00': ""I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral, or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying, and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the person. And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes. And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion, then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi."", '03:01': 'And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war, or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis? I know some people who say ""Well, you know there\'s just so much out there -- I can\'t do anything, I\'m not going to even begin to try."" And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can\'t confront compassion anymore, and so they turn off the television and don\'t watch. In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.', '03:57': ""You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more."", '04:24': ""And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because, after all, God is just. Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized, if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist."", '04:59': 'So, God thought, ""Nope, I\'m going to create the world just with compassion."" And then God looked to the future and realized that, in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter. If you put boiling water in, it will shatter. What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.', '05:50': 'There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into action. So, like Snoopy, we can\'t just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: ""chesed.""', '06:25': ""All these three things, then, have to be melded together. The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds, but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity. You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots."", '07:13': ""This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail? It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation."", '08:02': ""And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement, we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things, that something I do here actually does matter in Africa, that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs."", '08:49': 'This ""18 minutes"" business, I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life -- the word ""life."" So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, ""In life, this is what\'s important in terms of compassion."" But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread, the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread, and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or ""matzah""? And they say ""It\'s 18 minutes."" Because that\'s how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean, ""dough becomes leaven""? It means it gets filled with hot air. What\'s matzah? What\'s unleavened bread? You don\'t get it.', '09:47': ""Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those, and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world."", '10:40': 'Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread, which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up. He said, ""God wants bread. That\'s it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.""', '11:31': 'And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, ""God, I don\'t know why you want this bread, but here you are."" And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home.', '11:53': 'The cleaner came into the synagogue. ""Oh God, I\'m in such trouble. I\'ve got children to feed. My wife\'s ill. I\'ve got no money. What can I do?"" He goes into the synagogue. ""God, will you please help me? Ah, what a wonderful smell."" He goes to the ark. He opens the ark. ""There\'s bread! God, you\'ve answered my plea. You\'ve answered my question."" Takes the bread and goes home.', '12:20': 'Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, ""I\'m an idiot. God wants bread? God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"" He rushes to the synagogue. ""I\'ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."" He goes in there, and it\'s not there. And he says, ""God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week, with raisins.""', '12:45': 'This went on for years. Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark. Every week, the cleaner would come. ""God you\'ve answered my plea again."" Take the bread. Take it home.', '12:59': 'Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said, you know, ""This is what\'s happening.""', '13:12': 'And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen. ""You mean God didn\'t want my bread?""', '13:22': 'And the poor man said, ""And you mean God didn\'t answer my pleas?""', '13:29': 'And the rabbi said, ""You\'ve misunderstood me. You\'ve misunderstood totally,"" he said. ""Of course, what you are doing,"" he said to the rich man, ""is answering God\'s plea that we should be compassionate. And God,"" he said to the poor man, ""is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give."" He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man\'s hands and said, ""Don\'t you understand?"" He said, ""These are the hands of God.""', '14:11': 'So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me, so that I can see the world clearly.', '15:14': 'And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity, to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard, and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years, the blackboards were fine, but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them."", '01:00': ""And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth, because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk."", '01:33': '(Laughter)', '01:34': ""That's not what I'm here to talk about, but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about, I had recently come back from Jordan, where I had an amazing experience with a camel."", '01:53': '(Laughter)', '01:56': 'And we were in the desert.', '01:57': ""Richard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah."", '02:00': ""We were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep. There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert, the Jeep broke down. The guys got out, they put the hood up, they started working under the hood, got it going again. About a hundred yards, it broke down. This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed, we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert."", '02:38': 'And eventually, our worst nightmare happened: they flooded the engine. And they said, ""Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."" And we said, ""We get out and walk?"" One water bottle, remember, guys, four people. And they said, ""Yeah, yeah, we\'ll walk. We\'ll find some camels."" We got out and walked, and sure enough, about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill, and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering, and 10 dollars later, we had four camels. They went down like elevators; we got on them. They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them, got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels, and they started galloping. And if you\'ve ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride. There\'s also one other aspect about these camels. About every 10 steps, they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.', '03:31': '(Laughter)', '03:32': ""So we kept on going, and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination, where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators, we sort of clumsily get off, and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point, and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States."", '04:06': 'So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, ""You know, maybe I should bring a camel. It\'s the best designed animal in the world."" He went, ""Nah. I don\'t think we want to be bringing a camel."" And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said, ""I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up; take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.""', '04:39': 'So, I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there, and I took one look at this camel. It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.', '04:53': '(Laughter)', '04:56': ""Now, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut, it is a scary, scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel, someone was smoking Bedouin high grade."", '05:08': '(Laughter)', '05:09': ""So we got as close to it as possible, and I'm going to share this. Chris, if you want to roll this film.

No! See, now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut, they're similar to seals in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose."", '07:13': 'KB: Ears?', '07:14': ""SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes, but there's the secondary -- I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer."", '07:53': ""Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand. Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves, but they do have one, like, big nail."", '08:36': '(Audience laughter)', '08:37': ""You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot, especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be, but it works for them. So, what the hell."", '08:58': '(Audience laughter)', '08:59': 'Now, they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally, they poop wherever they want to, but during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don\'t know if you\'ve read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants, you know what I mean, like, ""Br-r-r!"" These big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see, right here, it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately, he\'s a very aggressive animal, so he\'s actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance. I\'m guessing that he\'s at least 1,600 pounds. But I would put him closer to 2,000. He\'s basically a walking mulch pile. We\'re kind of like buds, but I\'m also a male as well.', '09:52': ""KB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.

One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now, what you also didn't see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?"", '11:34': ""I'm going to show you another film. But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee, it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it, please?"", '12:12': 'Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I\'m seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs -- and I\'m very well ... hung. I\'m TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I\'m smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose -- with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips -- that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump? Ogden Nash once wrote: ""The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two, or else the other way around. I\'m never sure. Are you?"" Here\'s a hint: Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn\'t store H2O. I\'m built to last. I\'m the go-to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won\'t sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF, enough to fry an egg. I\'m able to lose 40% of my weight without dying. (Most animals would if they lost half that much.) I\'ll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I\'m powerful. Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse -- And cover 26 miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand. (Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?) I\'m a good provider, too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese. ""Camels are like angels,"" a Bedouin once said.', '15:06': '(Applause)', '15:09': ""Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large, we really don't have to adapt to our environment; we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference, not just this year, but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it; it has to adapt to the environment."", '15:49': 'Ricky, thank you very much for having me.', '15:51': ""RW: That's terrific.

The ill effects are suffered by all, rich and poor, city people and village folks, those inland and those on the coast. Nobody is exempt. So how do we give our children the chance to grow up in a world where the air is clean? Our next speaker addresses this vital question. So join me in giving a wholehearted welcome to the public policy expert and author, the multifaceted Dr. Arunabha Ghosh.', '00:40': '(Music)', '00:48': 'Arunabha Ghosh: Let me tell you a story from China. In 2014, China declared war on pollution. In November that year, there was an international summit there. Presidents and prime ministers from many countries arrived. So industries around Beijing were shut down, half the cars were taken off the road. That week, I took a photograph of the unusually blue sky in Beijing. A few days later, when the summit had ended, the factories were humming again, the sky had again turned light grey. So newspapers started urging the government to make the blue skies permanent. Then in early 2015, a private citizen produced a documentary on air pollution called ""Under the Dome."" Just within four days, it was viewed 300 million times, and millions more continued discussing it on social media. Eventually, the government acted, and by 2018, the bulk of the Chinese population had witnessed a decline in air pollution by 32 percent on average.', '01:52': 'When will we demand clean air in India?', '01:56': ""I have a six-year-old daughter. Every morning, when I drop her to the school bus stop, I have to remind her not to take off her mask. That's the kind of world we live in. One day she pointed me to an advertisement for a face wash, which claimed that the polluting particles lodged deeply in our skin could be miraculously washed off. But what of the particles lodged in our lungs? When it's difficult to make out the difference between the lung of a smoker and the lung of a nonsmoker, we have a real problem, because I can run an air purifier at home, but can I lock up my daughter at home?"", '02:33': ""Air pollution is the great leveler. It affects us all, rich and poor, city dweller or village folk, those living inland or those living on the coast, and it's affecting our health, our economic growth, our quality of life. In 2017, more than 1.2 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution. That's more than those deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria or diarrhea."", '03:01': 'At the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, my colleagues find that today, one in two Indians is breathing air that does not meet our air quality standards. And the economic impact of this public health crisis is more than 80 billion dollars every year. At CEEW, my colleagues find that 80 percent of Indians can breathe clean air if we adopted stringent pollution controls.', '03:28': ""So here is my vision for India. In 2027, when we are celebrating our 80th year of independence, can we ensure that, by then, 80 cities in India have reduced air pollution by 80 percent? Let's called this Mission 80-80-80, and this is possible, but the role of citizens is going to be critical. To combat air pollution, we have to create a democratic demand for clean air. We can make this happen."", '04:02': 'First, we have to educate ourselves. Low-cost sensors give us real-time information about the air quality, but we still need information about how to interpret it and how to act. So we need to target information to schools and children, to resident welfare associations, to the elderly, who are more at risk. You know, when the temperature outside is 30 degrees versus 40 degrees, we know how to dress, we know what to do, what not to do. We need, similarly, information on what precautions to take when the air quality outside is poor, very poor, severe or hazardous.', '04:39': ""Second, we need to become active monitors. Today, most Indian cities and much of rural India have no air quality monitoring at all. So we need to demand that air quality sensors are installed in every constituency. Today, in Parliament, who is going to stand up for us as the air quality warrior? When enforcement agencies land up at polluting sites or dust-spewing construction sites, their whack-a-mole approach doesn't always work, because as soon as their attention turns somewhere else, the offenders go back to business as usual. We citizens have to become the fire alarms. We have to demand emergency call-in numbers and specialized task forces that can respond in real time to pollution sites. So we need not just the authority but the enforcement strength to crack down."", '05:32': ""Third, we have to be prepared to pay a price, whether it's for cars using BS6 fuel or for more expensive electricity from cleaner power plants. Last year, just before Diwali, I took a surprise inspection of polluting industries in an unauthorized industrial area just outside of Delhi, and I found polluting firecrackers were being sold. The Supreme Court had mandated only green firecrackers could be sold, but those were nowhere to be found. But the polluting ones were available. Why? Because we were ready to buy. As citizens, we have to reduce the demand for these polluting products or be prepared to pay more for cleaner products."", '06:16': ""Fourth step: let's build some empathy for our fellow citizens. How much does it take to keep a night guard warm rather than force them to burn rubbish to stay warm in winter? Or, let's take farmers. You know, it's very easy to blame them for burning the stubble of the rice paddy crop every winter, which causes air pollution. It's much harder to understand that it's the combination of our agricultural policy and our groundwater crisis that often leaves the farmer with no option but to burn the stubble. So we need to draw in the urban poor laborer or the rural poor farmer into our collective call for clean air. Farmers come and tell us that they want to adopt sustainable agriculture, but they need some help."", '07:01': ""And fifth, we have to change our lifestyles. Yes, public transport is often not available, but the choice to buy a cleaner, less polluting private vehicle is ours. The choice to segregate and recycle household waste is ours. You know, in Surat after the 1994 plague, citizens there take pride in keeping their city one of the cleanest in the country. Down south in Mysore, public-private partnerships and citizen-led eco clubs are coming together to reduce, segregate and recycle waste in a manner that landfills can be eliminated altogether. Now I'm not saying that officials have no responsibility here, but it is our collective apathy that takes the pressure off of our parliamentarians, the bureaucrats or the enforcement agencies."", '07:54': 'Mission 80-80-80 will only begin when we demand it. We have to create a democratic demand for clean air, because citizens, you and me, can decide what kind of air we breathe.', '08:12': 'Thank you.', '08:13': '(Applause)', '08:18': 'SRK: Thank you so much. Tell me something: India, our country, do we have any advantages? Have we become aware of it earlier because of all the inputs from people like you?', '08:30': 'AG: Our biggest strength: our people and our ability to make change without always necessarily relying only on the government. And that strength of civil society and civil demand for a civilized living condition is, I think, our biggest asset. Then, all of those and more will happen.', '08:51': '(Applause)', '08:52': ""SRK: Thank you, Dr. Ghosh. Bless you for coming here. And it's very enlightening.

And some of us rely on technology to do our jobs. For a while, I thought of machines and the technologies that drive them as perfect tools that could make my work more efficient and more productive.', '00:20': 'But with the rise of automation across so many different industries, it led me to wonder: If machines are starting to be able to do the work traditionally done by humans, what will become of the human hand? How does our desire for perfection, precision and automation affect our ability to be creative?', '00:39': ""In my work as an artist and researcher, I explore AI and robotics to develop new processes for human creativity. For the past few years, I've made work alongside machines, data and emerging technologies. It's part of a lifelong fascination about the dynamics of individuals and systems and all the messiness that that entails. It's how I'm exploring questions about where AI ends and we begin and where I'm developing processes that investigate potential sensory mixes of the future. I think it's where philosophy and technology intersect."", '01:13': ""Doing this work has taught me a few things. It's taught me how embracing imperfection can actually teach us something about ourselves. It's taught me that exploring art can actually help shape the technology that shapes us. And it's taught me that combining AI and robotics with traditional forms of creativity -- visual arts in my case -- can help us think a little bit more deeply about what is human and what is the machine. And it's led me to the realization that collaboration is the key to creating the space for both as we move forward."", '01:46': 'It all started with a simple experiment with machines, called ""Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1."" I call the machine ""D.O.U.G."" for short. Before I built D.O.U.G, I didn\'t know anything about building robots. I took some open-source robotic arm designs, I hacked together a system where the robot would match my gestures and follow [them] in real time. The premise was simple: I would lead, and it would follow. I would draw a line, and it would mimic my line.', '02:14': ""So back in 2015, there we were, drawing for the first time, in front of a small audience in New York City. The process was pretty sparse -- no lights, no sounds, nothing to hide behind. Just my palms sweating and the robot's new servos heating up. (Laughs) Clearly, we were not built for this. But something interesting happened, something I didn't anticipate."", '02:37': ""See, D.O.U.G., in its primitive form, wasn't tracking my line perfectly. While in the simulation that happened onscreen it was pixel-perfect, in physical reality, it was a different story. It would slip and slide and punctuate and falter, and I would be forced to respond. There was nothing pristine about it. And yet, somehow, the mistakes made the work more interesting. The machine was interpreting my line but not perfectly. And I was forced to respond. We were adapting to each other in real time."", '03:06': ""And seeing this taught me a few things. It showed me that our mistakes actually made the work more interesting. And I realized that, you know, through the imperfection of the machine, our imperfections became what was beautiful about the interaction. And I was excited, because it led me to the realization that maybe part of the beauty of human and machine systems is their shared inherent fallibility. For the second generation of D.O.U.G., I knew I wanted to explore this idea. But instead of an accident produced by pushing a robotic arm to its limits, I wanted to design a system that would respond to my drawings in ways that I didn't expect."", '03:45': ""So, I used a visual algorithm to extract visual information from decades of my digital and analog drawings. I trained a neural net on these drawings in order to generate recurring patterns in the work that were then fed through custom software back into the machine. I painstakingly collected as many of my drawings as I could find -- finished works, unfinished experiments and random sketches -- and tagged them for the AI system. And since I'm an artist, I've been making work for over 20 years. Collecting that many drawings took months, it was a whole thing."", '04:18': ""And here's the thing about training AI systems: it's actually a lot of hard work. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes. But in doing the work, I realized a little bit more about how the architecture of an AI is constructed. And I realized it's not just made of models and classifiers for the neural network. But it's a fundamentally malleable and shapable system, one in which the human hand is always present. It's far from the omnipotent AI we've been told to believe in."", '04:46': ""So I collected these drawings for the neural net. And we realized something that wasn't previously possible. My robot D.O.U.G. became a real-time interactive reflection of the work I'd done through the course of my life. The data was personal, but the results were powerful. And I got really excited, because I started thinking maybe machines don't need to be just tools, but they can function as nonhuman collaborators. And even more than that, I thought maybe the future of human creativity isn't in what it makes but how it comes together to explore new ways of making."", '05:23': 'So if D.O.U.G._1 was the muscle, and D.O.U.G._2 was the brain, then I like to think of D.O.U.G._3 as the family. I knew I wanted to explore this idea of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale. So over the past few months, I worked with my team to develop 20 custom robots that could work with me as a collective. They would work as a group, and together, we would collaborate with all of New York City.', '05:46': 'I was really inspired by Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li, who said, ""if we want to teach machines how to think, we need to first teach them how to see."" It made me think of the past decade of my life in New York, and how I\'d been all watched over by these surveillance cameras around the city. And I thought it would be really interesting if I could use them to teach my robots to see. So with this project, I thought about the gaze of the machine, and I began to think about vision as multidimensional, as views from somewhere. We collected video from publicly available camera feeds on the internet of people walking on the sidewalks, cars and taxis on the road, all kinds of urban movement. We trained a vision algorithm on those feeds based on a technique called ""optical flow,"" to analyze the collective density, direction, dwell and velocity states of urban movement. Our system extracted those states from the feeds as positional data and became pads for my robotic units to draw on. Instead of a collaboration of one-to-one, we made a collaboration of many-to-many. By combining the vision of human and machine in the city, we reimagined what a landscape painting could be.', '06:56': 'Throughout all of my experiments with D.O.U.G., no two performances have ever been the same. And through collaboration, we create something that neither of us could have done alone: we explore the boundaries of our creativity, human and nonhuman working in parallel.', '07:12': ""I think this is just the beginning. This year, I've launched Scilicet, my new lab exploring human and interhuman collaboration. We're really interested in the feedback loop between individual, artificial and ecological systems. We're connecting human and machine output to biometrics and other kinds of environmental data. We're inviting anyone who's interested in the future of work, systems and interhuman collaboration to explore with us. We know it's not just technologists that have to do this work and that we all have a role to play."", '07:46': ""We believe that by teaching machines how to do the work traditionally done by humans, we can explore and evolve our criteria of what's made possible by the human hand. And part of that journey is embracing the imperfections and recognizing the fallibility of both human and machine, in order to expand the potential of both."", '08:07': ""Today, I'm still in pursuit of finding the beauty in human and nonhuman creativity. In the future, I have no idea what that will look like, but I'm pretty curious to find out."", '08:18': 'Thank you.', '08:19': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the sound wasn’t coming from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered its unpredictable eruption?', '00:49': 'The story of any volcano begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, the consequences can be explosive.', '01:40': 'One of the most common causes of an eruption is an increase in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements and compounds, many of which are dissolved in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico.', '02:36': 'There are two known natural causes for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds into the mix. But bubbles can also form when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration of the compounds that form explosive bubbles.', '03:12': 'Not all eruptions are due to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change could increase volcanic activity.', '03:55': 'Finally, eruptions can occur when the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust can be stretched thin as continental plates shift away from each other.', '04:29': 'Unfortunately, knowing what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, infernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies.', '00:49': 'Seemingly empty regions of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments, bits of rock, and, further out, ices.', '01:49': 'We’ve observed thousands of these disks in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together into larger and larger masses.', '01:59': 'Dust grains 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can only hold tiny things together.', '02:22': 'And there’s a problem: once dust clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow is the first mystery of dust bunnies.', '02:39': 'One theory looks to electrostatic charge to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, and UV photons knock electrons off of gas atoms within the disk, creating positive ions and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes clusters together, like repels like and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy particles can knock more electrons off of some dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, and clusters grow rapidly.', '03:28': 'But before long we reach another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form, how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust.', '04:37': 'Eventually the chondrule pellets get cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today.', '04:57': 'Ultimately, the seeds of everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t have been right for the formation of life on our planet.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/kristalina_georgieva_how_to_rebuild_the_global_economy,How to rebuild the global economy,"The coronavirus pandemic shattered the global economy. To put the pieces back together, we need to make sure money is going to the countries that need it the most -- and that we rebuild financial systems that are resilient to shocks, says Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She takes us inside the massive economic stimulus efforts leading the world toward recovery and renewal and discusses what it will take for countries to emerge from this ""great transformation"" even stronger than before. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded on May 18, 2020.)",0:42:21,42.35,213044,2020-05-19T19:57:17+00:00,"['economics', 'coronavirus', 'finance', 'pandemic', 'inequality', 'leadership']","['English', 'Français', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'فارسى']",Kristalina Georgieva,"Managing Director, International Monetary Fund","{'00:04': ""Chris Anderson: I get now to introduce one of the most powerful women in the world. I mean, if we are to escape from the mess that we're in right now, she is going to play a major part in helping us do that. She's the head of the International Monetary Fund, a delight to welcome here Kristalina Georgieva. Kristalina, welcome."", '00:30': 'Kristalina Georgieva: Great to be with you, Chris. Thank you for having me.', '00:34': 'CA: So you just took on this role late last year, and within four months, boom, COVID arrives. That is one heck of an introduction to a new job. How are you doing?', '00:47': 'KG: Well, I find strength in action. And at the Fund, we have been, from day one on this crisis, leaning forward with everything we have to provide lifelines to countries, and that means to people and businesses. Already, we have received over 90 requests and we have offered, to 56 countries, critical financial packages.', '01:22': ""CA: You've described this pandemic as a crisis like no other. In what way a crisis like no other?"", '01:30': 'KG: Truly like no other. First, never before we will inflict on the economy consciously so much pain to fight a virus and save lives. We are asking businesses not to produce and consumers not to go out and consume. At the Fund, we labeled this ""the Great Lockdown."" Second, never before there would be such a rapid change of fortunes practically for everybody around the world. In January, I was in Davos, talking about ""anemic growth,"" growth of three percent. In April, during our spring meetings, it was already minus three percent. In January, we predicted 160 countries to have positive income per capita growth. Now it is 170 countries with negative income per capita growth. Now this, we call ""the Great Reversal."" Very painful. And three, uncertainty. We always live with uncertainty, Chris, but this time, it is the uncertainty of a novel coronavirus that policymakers have to integrate. We at the Fund combine epidemiological projections with our traditional macroeconomic modeling to see through that uncertainty. I must add to this, I very much hope that when we go on the other side in the recovery, we can use a new term and call it ""the Great Transformation."" Make the world a better place.', '03:35': ""CA: Well, I'll be excited to come on to that in a bit. But in this moment of responding to the crisis, the main tool that seems to have been executed, at least by the rich countries, has been this massive economic stimulus, to the tune of trillions of dollars. Is that a wise response?"", '03:58': 'KG: It is a necessity. And you don\'t hear the Fund often telling countries, ""Please, spend. Spend as much as you can."" And that is what we do now. We do add to that, ""And keep the receipts. Don\'t lose accountability to the citizens, to the tax payers."" The reason financial injection is necessary, these fiscal measures of almost nine trillion dollars are necessary, is because when the economy is standing still, unless there is help, unless there is monetary policy stimulus, firms are going to go massively bankrupt, people would be unemployed, the economy would be scarred. When we go to the other side, this scarring is going to make the recovery much more difficult. So that is a wise thing to do, and it helps the fact that central banks in major economies have been acting in a synchronized manner and that fiscal stimulus came really, really fast. This is how we see people being able to go through this very, very tough time.', '05:20': 'CA: But how far can it go? Because it\'s been described, in a sense, as ""printing money"" -- governments are issuing more and more bonds that have to paid back at some point. There\'s this term, in economics, of the Minsky moment, where things can go very well for a while, as everyone believes that, you know, that the train can keep running, the cycle can keep turning, you know, that governments have all this money. At some point, though, doesn\'t that break down? Do you worry that we may be nearing a Minsky moment, where, like Michael in Mary Poppins grabs his tuppence and starts a run on the bank. Is there stress in the international financial system now that concerns you, that makes you feel that we may be running out of headroom?', '06:08': ""KG: Of course, this cannot go on forever. I, for one, have trust in our scientists, I think we will see breakthroughs, and we will see also people in businesses getting accustomed to social distancing, to micromeasures that protect from spreading the disease. We have seen very massive injection in health systems, so hospitals can actually treat people that are coming for help. Obviously, if it is to go for a very long time, we would be worried. For now, what we are projecting is that there would be a gradual reopening -- we see it already happening in a number of countries. And we project for next year, 2021, a partial recovery. Not a full recovery, unfortunately, but coming to a better place. Now, what helps us is something that I don't particularly love, but I see it as a positive feature -- very low interest rates, in some cases, negative -- that allows this injection of fiscal measures and liquidity to be sustained over a number of years. And for now, we do not see on the horizon any return to increase in interest rates. So low for longer, and that is, in that environment, a helpful feature."", '07:51': ""CA: I mean, the financial crisis of 2008 came perilously close to breaking the entire financial system -- arguably, it did that. By most people's calculation, this is a far worse impact to the economy overall. Did the world learn something from 2008 that has helped us so far be resilient this time?"", '08:14': 'KG: What the world learned is that the financial system has to be tested and then strengthened to withstand shocks. And that is helping us tremendously today. The banking system is resilient, and even in the nonbanking financial institutions, there is more attention paid to how far can you go without running into trouble. I would say, if you look around the world, the most important lesson then was ""build resilience to shocks."" Those who have done it cope now better. And those who have not done it are in a much tougher spot. And actually, for the Fund, what we are praying is that we will come out of this crisis with this lesson about resilience being spread beyond the banking system, so we actually have this crisis-management mindset for a world that is inevitably going to be more shock-prone, because of climate and also because of the sheer density of economic and social life on our planet.', '09:42': ""CA: In your role, you're paying special attention to the situation in developing countries. And it does seem that they're facing a really terrible situation right now. Many of them have significant debt denominated in dollars. In the current crisis, their currencies are depreciating against the dollar, making it nigh impossible for them to execute the kind of injection, stimulus injections, that the rich countries are doing and seems to be the only way out. So that seems like a really dangerous cycle. Is there any way to break that cycle?"", '10:23': 'KG: Well, let me first separate countries that have built strong fundamentals. And now in this crisis, as we are receiving incoming data, not very many, but there are still some positive surprises, and they come from countries that have built stronger buffers, stronger fundamentals, have been more disciplined during good times. But indeed, we do see quite a number of emerging markets, developing countries, faced with multiple pressures. They had the hit from the coronavirus, many of them with weak health systems. Then, they have the high level of indebtedness, from before the crisis, which creates a much more difficult environment for them. Then, many of them are commodity exporters. Commodity prices, oil price, they went down very dramatically, that hits them again. Many rely on remittances. Remittances shrunk some 20 to 30 percent. And then you have a number of countries that are highly dependent on tourism. Tourism is the hardest hit sector, or one of the hardest hit. So, very tough for these countries, but this is why institutions like mine have been wisely created. The IMF, the World Bank, the regional development banks, we work very closely together in this crisis. The IMF, fortunately, that was one of the lessons from the 2008-2009 crisis -- make sure that in the center of the financial safety net is an IMF with financial strength. We have four times more money to lend today than we had then. From 250 billion to one trillion dollars. And of course, we are deploying these funds exactly for the countries that need us the most.', '12:34': 'And we did one more thing. With David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, we called for a debt moratorium for the poorest countries to their official bilateral creditors. And people tend to say, ""Oh, we don\'t work together, it\'s not good enough."" But here is an area where we made this call in late March, and in mid-April, the G20 agreed on this moratorium. Amazing, we had the Paris Club, China, the Gulf countries, all agreeing that we should not suffocate the poorest countries by asking them to pay their debts when their economies are standing still.', '13:23': ""CA: Is it possible that some developing countries are overdoing the lockdown policy? I mean, if large numbers of your citizens are already struggling to stay alive, isn't it almost like a death sentence to order them not to leave their homes?"", '13:39': 'KG: Well, Chris, one of the most heartbreaking conversations I would have is with leaders of countries where they have to stare in the face a choice of people dying from the virus or dying from hunger. And it is a very dramatic situation for them. Where you have a very large part of your economy being informal, where people live hand-to-mouth every day, the lockdowns we have in advanced economies are not quite applicable, but even there, countries are doing really well in social distancing to the extent it is possible. Many of the countries in Africa were very early to step up preventive measures. Why? They learned from the Ebola, they learned from prior crises that hygiene, taking any measure you can really helps. So again, I cannot stress enough how important is solidarity with these countries. How important it is for my institution to be there for them in a timely manner. And we do it.', '14:57': 'CA: Whitney.', '14:59': ""Whitney Pennington Rogers: Hi there, thank you, this is a wonderful conversation, and we're starting to see some questions coming from the community. The first one we have is from Bill Elkus, and it's a follow-up to something you were mentioning earlier, related to the stimulus, Kristalina. What are the prospects for inflation from such a large stimulus?"", '15:20': ""KG: At this point, we are not worried about inflation in advanced economies and in the majority of emerging market economies. We do worry about inflation in countries that have weak fundamentals, no access to foreign exchange easily, where the only way to address the crisis is our help or their central banks printing more money. And sometimes it's a combination of those two. Why I don't worry about inflation in advanced economies? Because countries that have their hard currency are putting liquidity in place, but at the same time, they're not seeing a big expansion of demand and prices being pushed up. So for these countries, at least for the observable future, we don't see a way of going, like after the Second World War, in inflation jumping up. The consumers are not consuming so aggressively, demand is not that strong, and these are societies where there is a lot of maturity in how they exercise their policy options. But if you are a poor country, that out of desperation, with no access to markets, no access to hard currency, ought to somehow put money supply enough, then inflation is going to be there. A very extreme case is Zimbabwe, and I do worry there may be other countries. So this is why we are so determined to engage with these countries early. And also look at some of the high-debt countries. Would it be necessary, on a country-by-country basis, to restructure debts to prevent that moving in a desperate direction?"", '17:52': 'WPR: Thank you. And we have one more question that I wanted to share from our community. This is from Keith Yamashita, and it\'s about how we all can be involved in some of this change. ""You are tasked with macro-economic and funding efforts. What should we do as citizens to help renewal and recovery?""', '18:08': 'KG: Well, it is incredibly important for all of us citizens -- and aside of being the head of the IMF, I am also a global citizen -- that we are to bring that notion of solidarity in a moment of crisis. I loved the way this segment was musically backed, and it was ""Lean on Me."" It is very important that we do create that sense -- ""we are in this together, we will get through it together."" And please, speak up on that. I was, for many years, crisis commissioner, and one thing I learned is that the majority of people are positive, good people. You can lean on them. And there is a minority that is hateful and fearful and also very loud. So, good people, speak up. Spread that sense of ""we are in this together, we\'ll get through it together.""', '19:30': ""WPR: Thank you. I'll come back later with other questions."", '19:35': ""CA: Kristalina, I'd love to expand on that and just ask you a bit more about leadership, actually. You know, when people think of the nations that have performed best, they often refer to -- when I say best, best in response to the current pandemic -- they often refer to Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Denmark and Norway. When they think of those that have performed worst, they often think of Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Sweden, Iran, Brazil, Russia and the United States. All of that second group are run by men, all but one of the first group are run by women. Is that a coincidence?"", '20:21': ""KG: Well, now, speaking a bit subjectively as a woman, I do believe that women are great to lead in a crisis. They are more likely to show empathy, to care about the most vulnerable people and to be able to speak about that. They are decisive. I can say that for myself, we take energy from action. And we don't tend to, kind of, mourn and complain too much. So there is perhaps something to be said about the value of gender equality for the future. Bring more women for this world of more crisis ahead of us."", '21:24': 'CA: It\'s obviously hard to make generalizations about gender of any kind, but I mean, is there also, almost, something about the embracing of nuance, that women might be better at that than men? Men are often, it\'s like, ""let\'s win, let\'s conquer,"" and in a situation like this, where it\'s all probabilities, it\'s like, there are so many complex dials to turn on this dangerous pandemic machine that we\'re trying to wrestle. I mean, are women better at handling nuance?', '21:56': 'KG: Let me say something, Chris. We need everybody, and we need this mixture of experience, knowledge and predisposition. Men and women coming together. I find it that it is great to have different perspectives when we make decisions. Then, the chances of making a good decision are higher. So we need each other, but we also need to recognize is that yes, there are certain things, I have seen it time and again, women are more willing to find a pathway to compromise, they\'re more willing to be corrected if they\'re wrong. Say, ""Oh, OK, that\'s a good point, let me integrate it in the way I think about it."" And when you are in uncertainty, that is a huge advantage in decision-making.', '22:54': ""CA: So perhaps talk a bit more about your own leadership in this moment. I mentioned you've only recently come to this job. Before that, you were European Commissioner, you dealt with humanitarian crises in more than one part of the world. And in your own country, Bulgaria, you witnessed the wholesale transformation of the country, both politically and economically. What lessons can you bring from your past experience to this moment?"", '23:21': 'KG: Well, there are many things I learned. I was very fortunate to have these multiple experiences for the job I have now. But let me highlight three.', '23:33': 'First, how critically important it is to prepare for a crisis. Kind of, think of the unthinkable, and then act with some foresight when a shock hits you. You have a title for this series called ""Build Back Better."" I actually would like to modify it, if I may, and I would talk about ""Build Better Before."" Preparedness, prevention, pay off big time.', '24:17': 'The second -- and not necessarily in priority, it is as important -- is collective action, working together. Seeking help, offering help. Makes a huge difference in an emergency.', '24:36': ""And the third is something I learned time and again. We don't know our internal strength until we are hit. We are so resilient, we are so able to withstand shocks, especially when we come together, that this always gives me this sense of optimism that, as hard as it is, we can overcome it. From the days when my country collapsed, the economy collapsed, I would get up at four o'clock in the morning, queue to buy milk for my daughter, to the days when I would see Syrian refugees in terrible situations helping each other, to today, when I'm the head of the IMF, that internal strength, our power of resilience, the more we are together, the more it is amplified."", '25:44': 'CA: Actually, could you talk a bit more about the role of the IMF, especially as we look forward to trying to recover from this? What specifically can your organization do to take us forward?', '25:56': 'KG: So there are three things that are quite unique for the IMF, and they\'re really so important in a time of crisis. The first one is to give a good diagnostic of what is happening and what is the way forward. Let me just say, in this crisis, in the very first weeks, we put together, we call it policy action tracker, for 193 countries. What actions are countries taking, how they can learn from each other, so we can be more effective together. We are adding to it, now, actions for responsible reopening of the economies exactly with that purpose. What we are known best for, we are the financial first responder. We are coming in this incredible shock with very significant financial firepower. And what people don\'t know is that the Fund has multiple instruments. Emergency financing is the one we doubled for this crisis. And it is no conditionalities. We are asking one thing, Chris. Pay your doctors and your nurses, your hospitals, protect your most vulnerable people and parts of the economy. That\'s it, this is the condition. And the third thing we do at the Fund is to help countries have the capacity for good policies. After the financial crisis, we helped many countries to have good debt management, good fiscal management, transparency and accountability to improve the performance of public finance. So the Fund is not a very big organization by any standard, we are some 3,000 people. Highly professional, incredibly committed. When you use the expression ""all hands on deck,"" that\'s us. And it is a digital deck, it is a digital deck these days.', '28:07': ""CA: I mean, this is a global crisis. A lot of people are worried that unlike perhaps even in 2008, where it really did seem there was a lot of global cooperation, there's actually, in some worrying ways, less this time? Are you worried about how crucial is that to getting us through this?"", '28:26': ""KG: I mean, my preoccupation is, in our mandate, in my area of responsibility, bring the membership together. We have almost the whole world, 189 countries are our members, and so far, I am very impressed by how responsive the membership has been. I put in front of them in the spring a package, very strong package of measures to expand the role of the IMF in the crisis. Everything that we ask for -- we ask for doubling emergency financing, we got it. Very interesting. We ask for tripling concession of financing. Exactly because, you know, like the virus hits people with a weak system the hardest, the crisis hits weak economies the hardest. So we wanted to triple concession of financing. Within one month, we got it. We asked for grants for debt relief, we got it. So what I'm trying to say here is that we need to focus on ways in which we bring the world together. And then act on that. Rather than complaining that maybe not everything is the way it should be, do your duty to the global community."", '29:55': 'CA: Well, indeed. And the IMF is dependent on the financing from its members, its key members.', '30:02': 'KG: Yes.', '30:04': ""CA: I mean, you spoke of the trillion dollars that you are looking to make available to nations that need it. As I read it, that comes from -- you've got these units called Special Drawing Rights. You basically draw a currency from members. And hasn't there been pushback, though, from the US, to block that effort of raising all that money?"", '30:27': ""KG: So the one trillion dollars is from our quotas and also from our ability to move money from well-to-do members from the advanced economies and lend it at very low or zero interest to the developing emerging markets. And we had this one trillion and what was very interesting, not everybody noticed that -- the US, in their two trillion dollars stimulus package, included the support for the IMF. The Special Drawing Rights is something that we, indeed, don't have yet consensus among the membership to do. It was done during the 2009 crisis, issuing liquidity, and it goes to everybody. And there are many voices, including mine -- I spoke to the G20 about that -- that are saying, well, that may be a good thing to do now. It is not being supported for reasons. It is not just capriciously."", '31:42': 'The problem with Special Drawing Rights is that when we issue them, they go to all members, and the advanced economies get 62 percent of the new allocation, and there are some that are saying, ""Can we think of something that is more directed, or exclusively directed to those who need it?"" But, Chris, everything is on the table for us. As the crisis unfolds, we need to do more, we bring the membership to do more.', '32:17': 'CA: Whitney.', '32:19': 'WPR: We actually have a question from the community that builds on what you\'re discussing right now. Yavnika Khanna asks, ""Which countries will prove to be resilient in the Great Transformation: those with popular leaders or those with sound financial systems?""', '32:34': ""KG: You know, they both matter. Countries with strong fundamentals are clearly going through this crisis with less trauma than those that had weak fundamentals to begin with. And of course, leadership matters. How you mobilize a country for action matters. In my view, what we would see on the other side, the winners would be those who think today of this crisis also as an opportunity. Clearly, digital transformation is a huge opportunity. Moving to e-learning, e-government, e-payments, e-commerce, linking small and medium-sized enterprises through digital to consumers, big winner. Secondly, I very much hope that we would come on the other side with a low carbon footprint and a more climate-resilient economy. Those who move in this direction, they would reduce the risk for themselves and the world. From this other crisis, that we are not talking so much about these days, but it hasn't gone anywhere. And you know, if you don't like pandemic, you are not going to like the climate crisis at all. And also, countries that are thinking of how to make the economy in the future a fairer economy. In other words, we have been seeing inequality building up before this crisis. My colleagues who have researched pandemics have a very bitter lesson for us. After pandemics, after H1N1, after SARS, after Zika, inequality goes up. Well, are we going to let inequality to go up, up, after this crisis? And if we do, we are damaging the fabric of our societies, and my sense is that hundreds of millions of people in this crisis would much prefer to have a simpler, fairer, more equitable world to live in, and definitely, a more sustainable world."", '35:19': 'CA: Mm.', '35:20': 'KG: Those would be the winners.', '35:24': 'WPR: Definitely. And just one more question from our community, before turning it back to Chris for some final questions here. You know, this one is from Sarah Rugheimer. And the question is, ""What do you see as the main potential positive shifts / changes in this world from this pandemic, say, two to 10 years from now?""', '35:47': 'KG: Well, I touched upon it a little bit. First, I hope to see fiscal policy to help us recover to be geared towards green recovery and more equitable recovery. And that is something that is in the hands of policymakers. It can be done. Secondly, I very much hope to see us integrating what we have learned from the crisis, in terms of virtual work. My organization, the IMF, well, we can shrink our carbon footprint dramatically just by sustaining the practices we are developing now, and we will. I certainly hope to see, in the future, much more attention to two things that we saw in this crisis are essential. Universal access to health in some form, strong health systems, as well as strong social safety nets, built as automatic stabilizers in a time of shock. And by the way, it is cheaper if we do it in this way. The bill for everyone is going to be smaller. And also, I very much hope that this notion of investing in people, recognizing that now that we see this horrible tragedy, the loss of lives, that investing in people is the very best investment we can make.', '37:44': 'CA: Mm.', '37:46': ""WPR: That's great."", '37:48': 'CA: So, see you again in a minute, Whitney.

In this moving talk, screenwriter and director Fernando Salem champions the lasting power of storytelling, speaking to the ways in which a well-crafted narrative can help kids learn and retain history.",,,210740,2019-03-01T23:35:32+00:00,"['history', 'storytelling', 'education', 'children', 'television']","['English', 'Español']",Fernando Salem,,"{'0:00': 'Well, I don\'t know about you guys, but for me, the part that I enjoyed the most about going to school is when they took us out on excursions or we went camping. I think I liked it a lot because in that moment you felt free, you could see your friends with the light of day, you could watch the teacher interact with the real world. But I think that the most important was that when we went on excursion learning and living were part of the same thing. I work as a director and screenwriter and in 2009 we had a problem. We had to ideate a TV show for kids that would tell the children about the May Revolution and the problem was that nothing came to us. To make things worse, with Sebastian Mignona and Nicolas Dardano, we have had the wonderful idea of offering to the Ministry of Education\'s TV channel to make an animated program; when none of us had the slightest idea on how to create a cartoon film. If you asked me when I was a boy what I wanted to do when I grew older, I would answer: ""I want to work making cartoons."" But it seems that with time I began noticing that animations were done in the United States. So if I wanted that work, I would have to be far from my parents, and I likely gave up. But now, I had the chance to write and direct a cartoon. So, a bit to reconnect myself with what I liked so much from the school, and also, I think, to see if an idea would occur to me, I went alone on an excursion to the Buenos Aires\' Cabildo. I arrive at the Cabildo, I go up to the first floor, turn left, and I find this image. The Primera Junta, and so I get closer, read the names, Saavedra, Moreno, Castelli, Belgrano, Paso, I look at their expressions, their faces, and there I had the first revelation. ""This is a pain."" (Laughter) There\'s no way -- (Applause) There\'s no way you can do something entertaining with this. The kids will always prefer to watch Pokemon, or Dragon Ball Z. If you think of it, they are able to store in their brain five complete seasons of Pokemon in Japanese, they watch the movies they like a million five hundred thousand times and they know the words by heart. And what is the difference between that content and this? Could we make the May Revolution as attractive as that? It seems that in front of content presented as pedagogical, educational, you lift a barrier. Like when they want to sell you something you do not need. There, I noticed that I passed through elementary and middle school without understanding well why San Martin crossed the Andes. And they must have explained it to me every August 17th. But it didn\'t hit me, I didn\'t get it, or it did not stick. When I returned from the Cabildo, I started thinking: ""So, what stuck with me from school?"" And then comes the image of my favorite teacher. You may as well have a favorite teacher from elementary or middle school. Well, Claudio Simari was mine. He was my teacher from 4th grade. And I was reminded of him because he was able to overcome the barrier that I had placed. And I remembered two moments where Claudio did it. And maybe in that there was an idea to create this cartoon. One morning Claudio arrived and he put on a piece of music. Claudio chose a song by Terea Parodi that was called ""Hurry up Jose,"" and he wanted to explain to us the drama of the floods in Formosa. For those who don\'t know it, the song recounts a desperate call from a woman to her husband to escape together before the flood arrives. That was enough for me to never forget about the floods of Formosa. And for each time I listen to ""Hurry up Jose,"" to be moved again. The other thing I remember about Claudio is that one day he decided to share with us a personal story. And he must have done it in such a sensitive way that I can even remember where I was sitting in the classroom. It turned out that Claudio was being sent to the war. Claudio was in the line to enter the plane that was going to take him to the Falkland Islands. He already had his uniform on, it was dawn, and he suddenly looks and he notices his parents had just arrived to say goodbye. So Claudio went running from the line to give a final hug, and when he returned they sent him to the back. And he was one of the few that failed to enter the plane. Those were the last flights that managed to reach the islands, and a friend of Claudio died in combat. With that alone, I would never forget the Falklands war, neither that history. How did Claudio do it? How did he impart on us ideas that 30 years later I still keep remembering? I realized one thing. What Claudio did, first of all, was to tell us stories. And we lived them like we were there with him. Claudio was a sort of medium, and we lived that experience we were in the classroom but we felt on an adventure. And the other thing I realized of Claudio is that he never underestimated us. We always thanked him for that, because Claudio didn\'t treat us like infants. We preferred Claudio over those men and women in television who would disguise as boys or girls. At first, they\'d come closer to become your friends, and then you realize that they want to teach you numbers or colors, or sell you something. Seems like Claudio knew that if you treat a child like a fool, you ran the risk that, whether the child thinks that you are the fool, because you\'re speaking to them like that, or that they grow up thinking they are a fool, which is much worse. Children can be lovely, tender, sensitive, but the truth is they are the same who invented bullying. They can be tyrants, cruel, fickle beings, just like us. If they are like us, then why should we treat them in a different way? Now, how are we? That was the question that we asked ourselves in that moment. One of my first assignments as director of ""The Dog on the Moon"" -- way before creating ""Zamba"" -- was traveling across the country visiting public schools and interviewing kids. I must have interviewed around 1,500 or 2,000 kids. They taught me to stop looking at them from above, to lower the camera, to look at them in the eyes, and to see the world as they see it. That ended up having a lot of impact in the project, because there is something from each of those kids in Zamba. Anyone who had contact with Argentina\'s hinterland knows that the representation of children we see on TV is quite different from reality. Of course, because TV is designed to treat children as consumers. Paka-Paka comes to treat children like children, and for us as storytellers, that was an incredible opportunity. So we started to design the character. We had to think of an Argentine boy. If you were to draw an Argentine boy, what would you do? What would the hair color be? His skin color? What would the width of the nose be? These are the first sketches of Zamba. At that time we asked ourselves if boys and girls would identify with a boy who did not have super powers, and that instead of a cape, he wears a pinafore like them. Finally, this is the definitive design of Zamba. (Applause) We made him short like Messi for agility and to facilitate escaping. He has a backpack so he\'s similar to those hectic kids that are running around with their backpack on. We put on his pajamas under his pinafore. We made his skin brown. If you look carefully, he has like some little horns here, to make it look a bit more mischievous. And we gave him a broken tooth, as a war wound of that battle we all go through and is called ""infancy."" At this point, you should be asking: ""How is it that a guy who went through elementary or middle school without knowing why San Martin had crossed the Andes, can write and direct a program on history?"" Gabriel Di Meglio, who is a historian and researcher at the CONICET, was on the team. Gaby, among other things, chose to be a historian because in his childhood he read Asterix. And I had the chance to sit with him, face to face, and ask him about history in the same way Zamba asks San Martin. Then, what at first seemed a hindrance ended up being an advantage because I could write Zamba from naivety, without solemnity. We could get our heroes off their horses, we could brush off the bronze; we could tell our history through humor. Today, we live in a time of peace. But throughout our history a lot of men and women lost their lives, the only life they had, to fight for values like freedom and independence. And they could not see the outcome of that struggle. It hurt me, for example, when I came to know that Belgrano died in a period of anarchy, with the feeling that all he had done had rendered useless. But it was useful. To all who do Zamba, we like to think that Belgrano, San Martin, Sarmiento or Juana Azurduy would like to know that those values of freedom and independence are moving on to the next generation. Today, kids recognize their struggles and recognize them as characters of Zamba on banknotes. (Applause) Zamba might be revolutionary? I have no idea. We can\'t know this by now. We may have to wait 20 or 30 years. And something similar must happen with teachers, right? How much time must pass so you can see the result of their efforts of their dedication? And when I was preparing this talk, tin! My favorite teacher, Claudio, comes to mind again. I said, ""Well, I have to tell him this, I have to share this with him."" So I googled him. Claudio did not have Facebook. And all I found was a very improbable e-mail account, and I wrote an email that said this I will read to you: ""Hello Claudio. I was your student 30 years ago, perhaps you don\'t remember me. I write you because I\'m one of the makers of a cartoon called Zamba, it\'s shown in Paka-Paka and I have to give a talk about it. I needed to tell you that Zamba is named Jose after ""Hurry up, Jose"" the song that one day you showed us to explain the flooding in Formosa. And that\'s also why Zamba is from Clorinda. I needed you to know that if you watch the episode about the Falklands, you will find a veteran teacher and it is a tribute to you. If by chance you see this mail I hope you are doing well and that you receive a little recognition and appreciation for the work you did with us."" (Applause) Today, was approaching and Claudio\'s reply did not come. And very recently it arrived. Claudio is still the guy I remembered. He went to live in Bariloche, he was a rural teacher, he devoted his life to teaching and he now works there at a center of teacher training. What was I supposed to do? I went to meet him. And it turns out that when I arrived, Claudio had a surprise for me. I did not remember, but on the last day of school Claudio asked us to write what we liked most of 4th grade. And these 30 years Claudio had treasured my answer and my peers\'. (Applause) ""What I liked about the year -- I wrote -- was the camp, because we played a lot and had fun."" Today, Claudio is here sitting among us. (Applause) And I have the possibility to thank Claudio personally and in front of you those gestures, that dedication, that one day he made us listen to a song, that one day he shared with us such a personal and intimate history as that of the Falklands war. Because those little things helped, they are what ultimately make that future engineers, future scientists, future teachers, future artists, workers, and perhaps even future presidents, today, at school, when they go out to recess they end up shouting: ""Let us be free, nothing else matters.""

After months of strategic planning and controversy, thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C. Here, they called for a constitutional amendment granting them the right to vote.', '00:43': 'By 1913, women’s rights activists had been campaigning for decades. As a disenfranchised group, women had no voice in the laws that affected their– or anyone else’s– lives. However, they were struggling to secure broader support for political equality. They’d achieved no major victories since 1896, when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women. That brought the total number of states which recognized a women’s right to vote to four.', '01:11': 'A new, media-savvy spirit arrived in the form of Alice Paul. She was inspired by the British suffragettes, who went on hunger strikes and endured imprisonment in the early 1900s. Rather than conduct costly campaigns on a state-by-state basis, Paul sought the long-lasting impact of a constitutional amendment, which would protect women’s voting rights nationwide.', '01:33': 'As a member of the National American Women Suffrage Association, Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip up support and rejuvenate the movement. Washington authorities initially rejected her plan- and then tried to relegate the march to side streets. But Paul got those decisions overturned and confirmed a parade for the day before the presidential inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. This would maximize media coverage and grab the attention of the crowds who would be in town.', '01:59': 'However, in planning the parade, Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds, including those who were racist. She actively discouraged African American activists and organizations from participating- and stated that those who did so should march in the back.', '02:15': 'But black women would not be made invisible in a national movement they helped shape. On the day of the march, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a ground-breaking investigative journalist and anti-lynching advocate, refused to move to the back and proudly marched under the Illinois banner. The co-founder of the NAACP, Mary Church Terrell, joined the parade with the 22 founders of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, an organization created by female students from Howard University. In these ways and more, black women persevered despite deep hostility from white women in the movement, and at great political and physical risk.', '02:52': 'On the day of the parade, suffragists assembled to create a powerful exhibition. The surging sections of the procession included international suffragists, artists, performers and business-owners. Floats came in the form of golden chariots; an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map of enfranchised countries. On the steps of the Treasury Building, performers acted out the historical achievements of women to a live orchestra.', '03:16': 'The marchers carried on even as a mob blocked the route, hurling insults and spitting at women,  tossing cigars, and physically assaulting participants. The police did not intervene, and in the end, over 100 women were hospitalized.', '03:31': 'Their mistreatment, widely reported throughout the country, catapulted the parade into the public eye—  and garnered suffragists greater sympathy. National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated their actions during the parade. After the protest, the ""Women’s Journal"" declared, “Washington has been disgraced. Equal suffrage has scored a great victory.""', '03:53': 'In this way, the march initiated a surge of support for women’s voting rights that endured in the coming years.

It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of them for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a patient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based bioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle attached to a printhead. It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely wider than 400 microns in diameter, and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness of a human fingernail.', '02:35': 'A computerized image or file guides the placement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a liquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place until it stabilizes. These printers are fast, producing the meniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time.', '02:53': 'After printing, some bioinks will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging nutrients, and multiplying.', '03:15': 'We can already print relatively simple structures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have also been successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial nerve regeneration in rats. Researchers have created lung tissue, skin, and cartilage, as well as miniature, semi-functional versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge. Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the ink if the nozzle is too small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients to all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the greatest successes so far have been with structures that are flat or hollow— and why researchers are busy developing ways to incorporate blood vessels into bioprinted tissue.', '04:17': 'There’s tremendous potential to use bioprinting to save lives and advance our understanding of how our organs function in the first place. And the technology opens up a dizzying array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with embedded electronics. Could we one day engineer organs that exceed current human capability, or give ourselves features like unburnable skin? How long might we extend human life by printing and replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology and its incredible output?'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From our early work on 4D printing, where we printed objects, dipped them underwater, and they transform, to our active auxetics that respond to temperature and sunlight, to our more recent work on active textiles that respond to body temperature and change porosity, to our rapid liquid printing work where we print inflatable structures that morph based on air pressure and go from one shape to another, or our self-assembly work where we dip objects underwater, they respond to wave energy and assemble themselves into precise objects like furniture.', '00:51': ""Or, at larger scales, using wind energy, we have meter-diameter weather balloons that assemble in the airspace above a construction site. For dangerous environments or harsh, extreme places where it's hard to get people or equipment, they can assemble in the airspace, and as the helium dies, they then come back to the ground, and you're left with a big space frame structure."", '01:11': 'All of this research is about taking simple materials, activating them with forces in their environment -- gravity, wind, waves, temperature, sunlight -- and getting them to perform, getting them to transform, assemble, etc. How do we build smart things without complex electromechanical devices?', '01:30': ""But more recently we were approached by a group in the Maldives, and they were interested in taking some of this research and ways of thinking and applying it to some of the challenges that they've faced in terms of climate change. And the first thing you do when you're approached by someone in the Maldives is say you want to go on a site visit."", '01:46': '(Laughter)', '01:47': 'It is amazing.', '01:49': ""So we went there and I actually walked away with a really different perspective on the future of climate change. Because you would imagine, you know, the Maldives are sinking. They're screwed. What are they going to do? But I walked away thinking, they might be the model, the future model of the built environment, where they can adapt and be resilient rather than our fixed, man-made infrastructure."", '02:08': ""But there's typically three main approaches to sea level rise and climate change. One of them is that we can do nothing and we can run away. And that's a pretty bad idea. As more than 40 percent of the world's population is living in coastal areas, as sea levels rise and as storms get worse and worse, we're going to be more and more underwater. So it's imperative that we solve this pretty demanding problem."", '02:30': ""The second is that we can build barriers. We can build walls. The problem here is that we take a static solution trying to fight against a superdynamic, high-energy problem, and nature is almost always going to win. So that's likely not going to work either."", '02:47': ""The third approach is using dredging. So dredging is where you suck up a bunch of sand from the deep ocean and you pump it back onto the beaches. If you go to any beach around the Northeast or Western Coast, you'll see that they use dredging year after year after year just to survive. It's really not a good solution."", '03:03': ""In the Maldives, they do the same thing, and they can build an island in a month, a brand new island they build from dredging. But it's really, really bad for the marine ecosystem, and then they become addicted to dredging. They need to do that year after year."", '03:16': ""But in the time that it took them to build that one island, three sandbars built themselves, and these are massive amounts of sand so big you can park your boat on it, and this is what's called a site visit. It's really hard work."", '03:29': '(Laughter)', '03:31': 'In Boston winters. This is massive amounts of sand that naturally accumulates just based on the forces of the waves and the ocean topography.', '03:42': ""So we started to study that. Why do sandbars form? If we could tap into that, we could understand it and we could utilize it. It's based on the amount of energy in the ocean and the topography in the landscape that promotes sand accumulation. So what we're proposing is to work with the forces of nature to build rather than destroy, and in my lab at MIT, we set up a wave tank, a big tank that's pumping waves, and we placed geometries underwater. We tried all sorts of different geometries. The waves interact with the geometry, and then create turbulence and start to accumulate the sand so the sand starts to form these sandbars on their own. Here's an aerial view. On the left-hand side, you'll see the beach that's growing. In the middle you'll see the sandbar that formed. So these are geometries that collaborate with the force of the wave to build."", '04:28': ""We then started to fabricate one. This was in February in Boston. We have large rolls of canvas. It's a biodegradable material, it's super cheap, easy to work with. We then sew it into these large bladders, and then we flew over there. And I know what you're thinking. This is not the Fyre Festival."", '04:45': '(Laughter)', '04:47': ""This is real life. It's real. And we flew there with these canvas bladders in our suitcases, we got sunburned because it was Boston winter, and then we filled them with sand and we placed them underwater. These are exactly the same geometries that you saw in the tank, they're just human scale. Large objects filled with sand, we'd place them underwater, they're just really simple geometries. In the front of them, you'll see it's clear water. The waves are crashing over. It's quite clear. And then on the backside, there's turbulence. The water and the sand is mixing up. It's causing sediment transport, and then the sand is accumulating. You'll see some friendly stingrays here that visited us. On the left is day one, the right is day three. You'll see the sand ripples in the light areas where the sand is accumulating just after two days."", '05:35': ""So this was last February, and it's very much ongoing work. This is just in the beginning of this research. Over the next year and longer, we're going to be studying this through satellite imagery and bathymetry data to understand what the short-term and long-term impacts are of natural sand accumulation in the environment. And the bigger vision, though, is that we want to build submersible geometries, almost like submarines that we can sink and float. Like adaptable artificial reefs, you could deploy them if there's a storm coming from one direction or another or if the seasons are changing, you can use these adaptable reef structures to use the force of the waves to accumulate sand. And we think this could be used in many coastal regions and many island nations around the world."", '06:20': ""But when we think about building smarter environments, think of smarter buildings or smarter cars or smarter clothing, that typically means adding more power, more batteries, more devices, more cost, more complexity and ultimately more failure. So we're always trying to think about how do we build smarter things with less? How do we build smarter things that are simple? And so what we're proposing at the lab and with this project specifically is to use simple materials like sand that collaborates with forces in the environment like waves to accumulate and adapt."", '06:54': ""And we'd like to work with you, collaborate with us, to develop this, to scale it and apply this way of thinking. We think it's a different model for climate change, one that's about adaptation and resilience rather than resistance and fear. So help us turn natural destruction into natural construction."", '07:13': 'Thank you.', '07:14': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a fashion photographer based in New York City. I've worked for lots of different magazines in New York, I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire, and for Interview and for GQ, and I got to work with some really beautiful people. My studio is in New York, but I also lived in Milan for about eight years, and in Paris as well, and worked for the house of Yves St. Laurent. I also did portraiture as well. I've worked for lots of different magazines, lots of great clients."", '00:39': 'But I was always told, every single day, who was beautiful. I was forced to work within certain parameters of the beauty standard. I was told, ""This is the most amazing model of the moment, you\'ve got to photograph her. She\'s incredible, you\'ve got to."" And then the next season, it would change again, and I\'d have to shift my ideas of beauty, and so we\'d go to the next model, and it was kind of really crazy, because I\'m an artist. I saw beauty everywhere. I didn\'t see beauty just on a magazine cover. I did a shoot with, of course, Cindy, for Revlon, and really fantastic, beautiful people. But I thought, someone\'s always telling me who\'s beautiful. And I was kind of frustrated.', '01:16': 'I left my studio one afternoon in New York, and I was walking down Park Avenue, and I saw, waiting for a bus at the corner of Park and 20th, this gorgeous kid. She had long, white, beautiful hair, and pale, pale skin. She had a genetic condition called albinism. I didn\'t know much about it, but she was stunning, and I\'d never met a model like this before. And I went to grab her and say, ""I have to take your photograph, you\'re amazing!"" And the bus came, she got on, and then she took off, and I was really glad because she was 12, and I\'d be in prison at the moment. (Laughter)', '01:44': 'But really, it was extraordinary to see this kid. So I continued right down to Union Square, to the huge Barnes and Noble, and started pulling any books, or any information I could about this genetic condition, albinism. And I found really kind of sad images. I didn\'t find images of this kid. I found images of people sitting in hospital beds, looking sad, looking downtrodden, just images of despair. I found images of a bright red eye, the albino eye. I\'m thinking, this kid had beautiful blue eyes, she didn\'t have red eyes. And then I started seeing images from Africa, where kids were surrounded by tribes pointing spears at them or in cancer wards and clinics, or they\'re just in beds, and images of illness, of sadness, of sickness. And then, I started, of course, going through those same medical textbooks, and started finding these typical images of kids and adults in their underwear, against walls in doctor\'s offices, with the black bar across their eyes saying ""disease."" This is a disease, defined by a disease. And I was like, this is crazy. And then I started going into it further, looking on the Internet, and all these different medical textbooks, and everything was so sad, and so negative.', '02:51': 'I then started finding images of the albino freak family in the circus, and then of course, all the movie references, from ""Powder,"" who had albinism because his mother was struck by lightning, to ""The Princess Bride"" and to ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" there were the ghost-like twins that came in and wreaked havoc, and destroyed things and then disappeared. Even most recently, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" there was like the evil albino driving around Paris at night, killing people, shooting at people. Well, I found out, through my research, that people with albinism have a visual impairment. There\'s always vision, but they\'re considered legally blind. So they certainly wouldn\'t be driving around Paris at night shooting at anybody and expect to hit anything. So I\'m thinking, this is crazy.', '03:32': 'So I contact NOAH. Now, NOAH is the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation. It\'s a support group for people living with this condition, and their families. And I\'m like, ""Hey, I\'m a fashion photographer. Let\'s show the world the beauty of albinism!"" And they said, ""Get lost."" And I\'m pretty persistent. I\'m like, ""Won\'t you talk to me?"" And they made it very clear to me about their fears of exploitation, that every time there was a magazine article that came out about a kid with albinism, it was a story about a victim. It was sad, or it was exploitative, or sensational — never positive, always negative. And I said, ""Okay, well then, what do we do here?"" So, let\'s form a nontraditional partnership — fashion photographer, genetic support group — and we\'ll work together. And you can keep an eye on me to make sure that we create something positive and powerful, showing the world the beauty of albinism. And they said okay. And I was like, fantastic, let\'s do this!', '04:26': 'So in walks the first person I\'m about to photograph. Her name is Christine, and Christine is a knockout. Long white hair, really tall. She\'s stunning. She walks into my studio. The way that she walks in, though, instead of this gorgeous girl, she walks in like this, her head\'s down, shoulders hunched, one-word answers, she looks down, no eye contact. This kid has been teased her whole life because of her difference. And it was so apparent in the fact that it left her with zero self-esteem. And I\'m thinking, oh, this kid is just so fragile. And just the day before, I was shooting Cindy on the same set, in my studio. I\'m thinking well, I have to be so careful with her — no, out of respect for this gorgeous kid, I\'m going to photograph her like I would anybody else. So the fan went on, the music went on, and I grabbed a mirror that was next to the set, and I held it up to her, and I said Christine, look at yourself. You\'re magnificent. And she looked in the mirror, and she got it. And she went from this to that. And that\'s our Christine, and she just exploded in front of the set. By the time she left the studio, she was kissing everybody on both cheeks, and saying, ""Ciao!"" and she was unbelievable. And I saw this transformation right in front of the lens, through photography, that she was now transformed, with a powerful and positive sense of who she is.', '05:47': ""The next day, she goes to school, she's going to change the way her community sees her difference. Instead of walking into that classroom like this, she's walking in like this. So it's all about ambassadors for change. It was extraordinary. And those first images, right after, we did a series of them, using several individuals with this condition, they were in Life magazine in 1998. So it was a while ago. It was a cover story, it was a five-page spread. It was really a fantastic editorial. It was great; I loved it. Then we used a lot of the images, though, from Life, and put them in other magazines, magazines worldwide. Magazines in the U.K., in France, in Italy and Canada, and other magazines in the States. It was amazing."", '06:29': ""So this is from the U.K., Christine again. Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, and Kristen. That's Lauren. We did a campaign for sunglasses. A lot of kids with this condition are photophobic, so they have a real strong light sensitivity. So we thought, perfect for a sunglass campaign. People magazine did a great story. So it was circulating, people were saying all this great stuff. It was fantastic."", '06:54': ""So I was getting calls, though. Getting calls from the U.K., saying, well we just saw this spread, can you come photograph our kids with this condition? We have a support group here, can you come meet our families? People in Africa were calling in the same. New Zealand, can you help us start a support group? I'm like, fantastic! This is great! Let's do it! So I would travel in all these places, as I was shooting and doing my commercial work,"", '07:16': 'I was at a local chapter conference in Philadelphia. Small family conference, about 40 families, did my presentation of kids with albinism, this mom came up to me, and she said, ""My son Randy, when he was a little boy, he\'d come home from school, and I could see the kids were teasing him, and he\'d be in tears. And I\'d buy him an ice-cream cone, or a toy truck, and he\'d forget about it."" She said, ""Now he\'s in high school. He comes home from school, I can see the pain, the anguish in his eyes. He walks in, he walks right past me, goes up to his room, slams the door, and I don\'t see him until the next day. He\'s not going to want to be photographed, he has zero self-esteem, this kid has such poor body image, and he\'s just so shy. But if you could just show him photographs of kids his own age, so that he knows he\'s not alone."" I\'m like, ""Of course. Where is he? Show me!"" She points over to Randy. Now Randy\'s sitting there — his pants are hanging down to here, his underwear\'s hanging out, he has this long, great big shirt, he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo. He\'s amazing, this kid. I crawl over to Randy. I\'m like, ""Randy, I speak to moms and dads every single day, terrified about the future of their kids with albinism. All they have to do is take one look at you, and they\'re going to be fine. Please let me take a photo of you. Your mother said, she told me, that you didn\'t want to be photographed."" He said, ""Rick, what do you mean? You have to understand, I\'m 16 years old. I don\'t talk to my mother."" And then he said, ""I want to be photographed. I want to show the world that who I am, with my albinism, but also other things about me —"" You see how shy he was. Very, very shy, Randy. But Randy created, early days in this idea, of this nonprofit group Positive Exposure, the idea of networking stories, sharing experiences and the images around the world.', '08:55': ""I'll kind of quickly go through the album. I was very interested, at that point, getting calls from everybody in the world, to find out more about this idea, a message, about albinism, or perceptions of people in communities about this syndrome, albinism. So I started hearing about stigmas, and discrimination, so what I looked at is really trying to explore cultural perceptions and attitudes towards this condition. This is my friend [unclear], who's a Kuna Indian in the San Blas region of the world, the San Blas region of Panama. She's extraordinary. So the incidence of albinism is about one in 20,000 worldwide. In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, the highest incidence in the world. We went to Fiji, actually, where we found out at the turn of the 19th century, a tribe could not hold their territory unless they had somebody with albinism in a powerful political position. My great friend Keke, I photographed in New Zealand, she's from India, from Delhi, but her family left Delhi because she was getting death threats. Now I'm thinking, this is horrible that they had to move, because she's eight years old. And we actually started a support group in Delhi, we found out that there are many kids that we worked with in their communities, after we started this group in India, that have had really positive experiences."", '10:09': ""So one of the things we want to make very clear is that we're not making generalizations about a community or a culture, and their reaction to people that are different. Keke's experiences were very different, but we've met many kids there that have been embraced by their communities throughout India. A great friend Sue Anna from Korea. Tom, who was just adopted by an American family, from China, This is my great friend Harry from Puerto Rico. And Natalia. She and I started the first albinism society in Russia. Maizan and her sister and mom in Malaysia. Ceara. All she ever wanted to do was be a dancer. She was told that because of her visual impairment, she'll never dance. She'll never be able to follow the choreography or the dance steps. She's like, they said, find another love, another passion. She's like, no. She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion, and just started a school for dance for kids with visual impairment. I'm going to zip through this. Roz, from Australia. I spend a lot of time in Africa, where there's a high incidence of mortality associated with albinism, due to skin cancer. This is my friend Siri, who when she was born, the father's family put her out of the house, thinking she was cursed. and Mom, not knowing what to do, put Siri in the sun to get her dark like her brothers and sisters. So you can see, it's all sun damage. A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa were put in special schools, schools for the blind, not because the tools were better there for kids with visual impairment, but more importantly, because the teasing was so great, the discrimination is so great, these kids don't do well in mainstream schools."", '11:45': 'I started an albinism society in Kenya with my friend C.K., who actually went to a mainstream school. I\'m like, C.K., how is it possible you went to a mainstream school? Nobody in Africa goes to mainstream schools. She said, ""It\'s because of my twin sister, Delphine."" Fantastic. She said Delphine would get all the work off the board, the things I couldn\'t see, she\'d help me with it. If the type was too small, she\'d blow it up for me, she said. But more importantly, when kids would tease me, Delphine would beat them up. (Laughter)', '12:12': ""But on a sadder note, I was spending a lot of time in Tanzania, where witch doctors are saying, bring me the bones of an albino, and I'll make a potion that will make you rich. So we're working very closely with the government there, I've been there six times in the last two years, to create public awareness programs to save these kids. This is the dancer. This is in the Shinyanga region. This is one of the visuals that we created in East Africa, trying to fight and educate the public."", '12:41': ""I received the Art of Reporting award, from an organization called the Chromosome 18 Registry. The larger organization was the Genetic Alliance, which was a coalition of all the genetic support groups, and it was the award for the Life magazine piece. The president at the time said, I'm also the founder and director of the Chromosome 18 Research Society and Registry. I'm like, fantastic! That's great. What's that? She's like, well, if you have an anomaly on your 18th chromosome, then you have all kinds of problems and difficulties and challenges, and then we look after you, through this support group, like NOAH is. So I'm like, that's great. She said, I see there's a universal message here, about all kids with differences, so it's not just about albinism. Would you come and speak to our families in San Antonio with these chromosome 18 anomalies? I'm like, sure! I went back to them thinking, what the hell is a chromosome 18 anomaly? I was an art major at the school of visual arts, I had no idea. But I looked it up, these are the images that I saw. I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, this is going to be rough."", '13:37': ""But I went to San Antonio, walked down to the auditorium where the kids and young adults were, opened the door, and I was instantly surrounded by kids screaming with laughter. There were kids with cleft palates, kids with mobility issues, feeding tubes, trachs, but they were kids, first and foremost. That's Rebecca and Pauline. My great friend, that's Ellington. He's awesome. Remy. That's Emory. Byron. Taylor. Elizabeth. And my great friend Sean."", '14:08': 'So we decided at that point to involve other organizations to be part of this larger exhibition that was going to be sent out from the People\'s Genome Celebration in 2001. The National Human Genome Research Institute and the Genetic Alliance invited me to create an exhibition at the Smithsonian, commemorating the mapping of the human genome. So we actually invited other genetic support groups to be part of this exhibition, not just on albinism, but all groups, again illustrating the universal applicability. I saw these images from the Marfan Foundation, these kids grow very, very tall, at risk of an aortic dissection, but they\'re amazing kids, and I thought, how gorgeous. And I understood the importance of this image, how important it was to show how beautiful, and to show how the image presents itself. But isn\'t there another way to show it? Because nobody, and I\'ve photographed thousands of kids now, with Marfan Syndrome, and nobody stands like this, with a portable black bar. It\'s extraordinary. So we decided to put them in a pool, show Billy swimming -- [""Bill with Marfan Syndrome""] -- show how it presents itself, but keep going, and keep presenting how these kids look, but put the humanity back in these gorgeous images. I only have a few seconds here, so I\'m going to go through. Cool girls at the Costello Conference. These are great friends Danielle and Maggie, who actually met at the last Costello Conference. For both, the first time they ever met anybody with the same syndrome. They go to the same conferences every year and I go and photograph them. And this year, they were there again in Florida, but this time it\'s a little different. They\'re gangsters now. (Laughter) But they\'re pretty amazing kids. I just want to talk very briefly about this really great kid, to talk very briefly about a project that we\'re taking these images, and bringing them into high schools.', '15:47': ""I can photograph a great kid in my studio, and she's having a brilliant time, and she feels 10,000 feet tall. By the time she leaves my studio and gets to Park Avenue, five people point at her, point at her birthmark, or at her white hair, or her wheelchair. So we have to make it relevant for all of us, for all these kids, to make people understand what the idea of celebrating diversity actually means. So we started a project called the PEARLS Project, where these photographs are going into high schools, and the kids that are in the images are blogging, and the students are following their blogs. And they all have these great video intros. I just want to give you this last one, and this is actually Byron, who is actually one of our bloggers. (Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron. I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14. When I was 10 months old, I had a left hemispherectomy. I had the left half of my brain removed, because I have something called Sturge-Weber Syndrome. I wear a brace on my right leg and right arm. I only see out of the right side of each eye, so sometimes it's harder for me to see things on the right side. So playing sports can be frustrating, because I might not see a ball coming. I didn't see that coming. Excuse me."", '17:14': ""Rick Guidotti: So we're using all the visual art to change public perceptions through these great kids. I feel as an artist, it's my responsibility. I know that when I was a kid, and I saw someone that was different walking down the street, If I stared, I got slapped by my mom. So the idea was if you don't stare, look away. And I think as an artist, it's my responsibility, and all of our responsibilities, to steady that gaze a little bit longer. Because you stand there, and you'll see a difference. You'll start seeing beauty in that difference. And you'll start seeing beautiful gorgeousness, and then this light just spreads, and once you're enlightened, it just changes your whole world. It's about seeing the beauty in all differences. Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over. Thank you guys, thank you.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only alternative they offer is sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish?', '00:39': 'Questions like this haunt Octavia Butler’s ""Dawn,"" the first in her trilogy ""Lilith’s Brood."" A visionary storyteller who upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep us awake at night.', '00:54': 'Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction film called ""Devil Girl From Mars."" Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story.', '01:17': 'Much science fiction features white male heroes who blast aliens or become saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the representation of their experiences.', '01:32': 'For Butler, imagination was not only for planting the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate them in new contexts.', '01:53': 'One of her most beloved novels, the ""Parable of the Sower,"" follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an ever-changing world.', '02:29': 'Lauren’s quest had roots in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to ""The Parable of the Sower,"" ""Parable of the Talents,"" she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual reality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.”', '02:57': 'While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in re-examining history. For instance, ""Kindred"" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation of her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission is to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, she herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to confront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence against Black women.', '03:27': 'With her stories of women founding new societies, time travelers overcoming historical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on the growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are inspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, history, technology and much more.', '03:51': 'As Lauren comes to learn in ""Parable of the Sower,"" ""All that you touch you Change.

I have absolutely no background in biology, chemistry or engineering, so bear with me, because I'll be talking about biomedical engineering today."", '00:24': '(Laughter)', '00:25': 'And please do stay here in the meantime.', '00:30': ""Industrial design is about making lots of things identical. The downside about that is, there's something impersonal about lots of identical things, because when you're trying to design one thing for one person to solve one issue, you can't really do that when you're making things aimed more to a demographic model or to a marketing requirements document, which is what we live by. So I got disheartened by the whole process in general, and went to rethink it and redesign designing altogether, went way back to my early, early design inspirations, and back to about eight years old, and that got me to this guy. Anyone here from MIT knows him or has a tattoo or poster of him somewhere."", '01:09': '(Laughter)', '01:10': 'Anyone else in the room, just for a hint, he is the engineer of engineers or the designer of designers. He is the guy who made bionics a household word in the form of the polyester-clad Six Million Dollar Man that I grew up with.', '01:25': ""The thing that came from this pop culture show, the real takeaway, was two main things: if you're designing for the person, for a real person, you don't settle for the minimum functional requirements; you see how far beyond that you can go, where the rewards really are way out in the fringe of how far past that document you can go. And if you can nail that, you stand to improve the quality of life for somebody for every moment for the rest of their life. I kind of distilled that down into a design philosophy, and infuse that into the studio that I have now; I'm trying to get everyone to think along these lines. It's not a profound philosophy, but it works for us."", '02:06': ""We work with prosthetic limbs, and the first thing you see about prosthetic limbs is that they are engineering brilliance. They can do amazing things; they can return all kinds of functionality and performance back to somebody's life. But from the vantage of an industrial designer, they're not quite there. What we don't see is the sculpture or the beauty or the individual qualities or the uniqueness or the elegance to them. They are brilliant, mechanical, utilitarian devices. And that's great, except for a lot of people, that doesn't work. People come to our studio all the time, and they have bubble wrap and duct tape, trying to approximate their original form. Or they'll have a gym sock stuffed with other gym socks to try to recreate the shape that once was; and that, to us, is not thriving."", '02:54': ""The body, to us, is not a mechanical entity, where mechanical-only solutions can address them. It's our personal sculpture, our kinematic sculpture. It is our canvas; it represents not just our physicality, but also a lot of our personality as well. So when you're designing for the body, maybe the thing isn't to design for mass production, but to design with the body in mind, to really think about curves instead of hard geometry, or uniqueness instead of identical. The problem is, we're constrained by mass production, which makes a million identical things but can't make one unique, individualized thing. So we scrapped that in the new design process, and we start with the person."", '03:33': 'This is a three-dimensional scanner, and that\'s what happens when you scan somebody: you get three-dimensional data into your computer. You can take the sound-side limb there, the surviving limb, mirror it over, and from now on, anything in the process will recreate symmetry -- something as personal and as hard to achieve as symmetry in the body. And you create a product that, no matter what, it\'s going to be as unique as their fingerprint. In fact, our process is incapable of creating two identical things. So we run it through computer modeling, 3D CAD. Here, we actually infuse a lot of the individual\'s taste and personality into it, everywhere we can, and we three-dimensionally print the results. We call the resulting parts ""fairings,"" because they\'re named after the panels on a motorcycle that turn it from a mechanical thing into a sculptural thing.', '04:21': ""We tried this on Chad. Chad is a competitive soccer player, lost his leg eight years ago to cancer. You can imagine, it's really tricky to play soccer when you have titanium pipe where there used to be a leg. The resulting parts recreated his shape and deliberately had an aesthetic that look like sporting gear. We wanted it to make it look like he just pulled it out of the gym bag, so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard. Two things happened. One, we expected: his sense of his body came back to him. He was suddenly able to control the ball, to feel the ball, because his body remembered that original shape that he had had up until eight years ago. The other thing, though, is that the other members of the team stopped thinking of him as the amputee on the team. Not that they didn't know, but it stopped becoming a focal point for him. And there is a certain very quiet value in that, we like to believe."", '05:15': ""James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash. And the motorcycle is still a big part of James's personality and style. Check out the tattoo on his forearm. We three-dimensionally printed that into what would be his calf. He has his tattoo, he has his morphology and he has the materials of his motorcycle. And the result is interesting in that you can't really tell at first glance where the motorcycle stops and where James starts. It's kind of a chimera hybrid between the two, and James likes that."", '05:45': '(Laughter)', '05:48': 'So, we don\'t ever try to make something look like it could be human. Our whole goal is to be unapologetically man-made, to take what\'s already there, morphology, and just make it really cool and beautiful, something that somebody can\'t wait to show the world, because that changes their look. You don\'t look at him and say, ""He\'s an amputee with a prosthetic."" You say, ""He\'s a guy with something really cool going on.', '06:10': ""Deborah wanted her curves back, but she also just wanted what came out of it to be really sexy, which is great for us to hear. We created this lace pattern that lends itself well to 3D printing. We created the first leg, I think, where the lace defines the contour of the leg, instead of the leg giving form to the lace. We switched things over. What I like about this shot is you can see daylight through it. So we're not trying to hide anything; the load-bearing carbon component is totally visible. We're just giving it form and shape and contours that were hers to begin with. We made her another leg that matched her purse, just because we could."", '06:51': '(Laughter)', '06:55': '(Applause)', '07:00': ""We made another one where we laser-tattooed the leather, because how cool would it be to be able to change your tattoos out from one minute to the next? Love that. We try to capture as much of somebody's personality as we can."", '07:12': ""This is George. His will be finished next week. This is the raw computer data that we deal with. He's kind of a classic, timeless-type personality, so we did herringbone tweed, but in polished nickel."", '07:26': '(Laughter)', '07:27': ""And Uve was all too proud to show his tattoos, so we are laser-tattooing those into the leather. Part of it is, yes, we're showing off, because we can do this, but the other part is this connects him to what will be a part of him. That is something really valuable; we believe in that. Tattoos are especially exciting for us. What happens if you take the tattoo, which is a combination of somebody's personal taste and choice, and their morphology, but now, let's say, you remove the person. You get a free-floating tattoo defining their body. So everything we do is about recreating and expressing something that means something to that person, and expressing that through what would be their body, whether it's speed or attitude or bling, whatever it is that captures and suggests them in the best way we can."", '08:15': ""Back to the 3D-printing thing and this whole process: we have a process that lends itself to making one thing per person; it's very individual, and it actually really lends itself well to complexity. So why not just print the entire leg? That's the concept that preceded the work we're doing now. This is a three-dimensionally printed leg. It's symmetric to the other leg. It is made in America, it is a trivially low-carbon footprint to create, curbside recyclable, costs about 4,000 dollars to create, and it is dishwasher-safe."", '08:48': '(Laughter)', '08:50': 'There\'s a value to that, too. People don\'t think about that all the time, but yes, throw it in the dishwasher, it works just great. This was based on the original idea that I could go anywhere in the world with nothing more than a camera and a laptop computer, use the camera as a 3D scanner and create for somebody, in a matter of hours, a very high-quality, three-dimensionally printed leg for a very low cost. The proof of concept works great, we\'re finding it; we\'ll get there. Or, we upped the quality of the materials and created this for John. The fun thing with John\'s leg is that when his fiancee looked at this, she joked and said, ""I like that leg better than that leg.""', '09:27': '(Laughter)', '09:29': 'And it\'s a joke -- she knows full well what he goes through -- but at the same time, there\'s something very valuable. He turned to us and said, ""Nobody says that."" He\'s never heard that in his life. That connected with him very deeply.', '09:41': ""So we like to think that this is a new type of design, where you're turning the original process on its head, where there is a dialogue that forms between the designer and the end user, where the designer relinquishes some of the control -- designers hate doing that -- and instead, is the curator of a process. And the end user relinquishes their body into the process, and their taste. I'd like to think that speaks to a greater change that's happening in the design world altogether; in this case, it's one where products will be evaluated on how well they address the individual. The individual will actually be part of the DNA of the end product itself. We will be evaluating products on how well they address a unique person, instead of a demographic model."", '10:28': 'This all really hit home for us in one of the first legs we did; when Chad here put on the leg, reached down and felt it and thought about it for a while. Then he turned to us and said, ""That\'s the first time I\'ve felt that shape in eight years."" We thought about that. And for all the technology and all the nights and energy we put into it, that\'s all we really wanted to hear.', '10:52': 'Thanks.', '10:53': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That day,  nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination, segregation, violence, and economic exclusion black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin.', '00:36': 'Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated facilities from within.', '00:55': 'Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the methods, groups, and people who could help further messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States  armed with strategies for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience.', '01:28': 'He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts almost a decade before.', '01:54': 'His largest-scale organizing project came in 1963, when he led the planning for the national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, because of his homosexuality.', '02:25': ""Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus, and on the day of the march he delivered the marchers' demands in a speech directed at President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly, without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices."", '02:52': 'In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his former communist affiliation.

https://www.ted.com/talks/joia_mukherjee_how_to_quickly_scale_up_contact_tracing_across_the_us,How to quickly scale up contact tracing across the US,"Contact tracing -- the process of identifying people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus in order to slow its spread -- is a fundamental tool in the fight against COVID-19. How can we scale this critical work across the entire United States? Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of Partners in Health, discusses how her team is working with public health agencies to ramp up contact tracing for the country's most vulnerable communities -- and shows why it will take a compassionate approach to be truly effective. (This ambitious plan is part of The Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change. The conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded May 27, 2020.)",0:15:09,15.15,196091,2020-06-02T19:49:12+00:00,"['public health', 'coronavirus', 'health care', 'pandemic', 'health', 'disease', 'inequality', 'community', 'Audacious Project']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', 'العربية', '中文 (繁體)']",Joia Mukherjee,"Chief Medical Officer, Partners in Health","{'00:06': 'Chris Anderson: Joia, both you and Partners In Health have spent decades in various battlegrounds, battling epidemics. Perhaps, for context, you could give us a couple examples of that work.', '00:20': ""Joia Mukherjee: Yeah, so Partners In Health is a global nonprofit that is more than 30 years old. We started famously in Haiti in a squatter settlement, people who were displaced. And when we talked to them, they wanted health care and education, houses, jobs. And that has informed our work, that proximity to people who are suffering. When you think about health care and the poor, there is always disproportionate suffering for people who have been historically marginalized, like our communities that we serve in Haiti. And so we've always tried to provide health care for the poorest people on earth. And we were launched into an international dialogue about whether that was possible for drug-resistant tuberculosis, for HIV. Indeed, for surgery, for cancer, for mental health, for noncommunicable diseases. And we believe it's possible, and it is part of the basic human right to care. So when COVID started, we saw this immediately as a threat to the health of people who were the poorest. And Partners In Health now works in 11 countries, five on the African continent, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the former Soviet Union. And we immediately prepared to scale up testing, contact tracing, treatment, care, and then saw that it wasn't being done in the United States in that way. And in fact, we were just sitting, passively waiting for people to get sick and treat them in hospital. And that message got to the governor of Massachusetts, and we started supporting the state to do contact tracing for COVID, with the very idea that this would help us identify and resource the communities that were most vulnerable."", '02:17': ""CA: So it's really quite ironic that these decades of experience in the developing world and elsewhere, that that has now really been seen as a crucial need to bring to the US. And especially to bring your expertise around contact tracing. So, talk a bit about contact tracing, why does it matter so much, and what would, I don't know, a perfect contact tracing setup look like?"", '02:44': 'JM: Well, first I want to say that you want to, always, in any type of illness, you want to do prevention, and diagnosis and treatment and care. That is what comprehensive approaches look like, and that ""care"" piece, to us, is about the provision of social support and material support to allow people to get the care they need. So that might be transportation, it might be food. So when you look at that comprehensive approach, for an infectious disease, part of prevention is knowing where the disease is spreading and how it\'s spreading and in whom it\'s spreading, so that resources can be disproportionately put to the highest-risk areas. So contact tracing is a staple of public health and what it means is that every time a new person is diagnosed with COVID or any infectious disease, then you investigate and innumerate the people they\'ve been in contacts with, and call those contacts and say, ""You\'ve been exposed,"" or talk to them, ""You\'ve been exposed, these are the things you need to know. First of all, how are you? Do you need care yourself?"" And facilitating that. ""Second of all, these are the information you need to know to keep yourself safe. About quarantine, about prevention."" And again, this would be with any infectious disease, from Ebola, to cholera, to a sexually transmitted disease like HIV. And then we say, ""OK, knowing what you know, do you have the means to protect yourself?"" Because often the most vulnerable do not have the means to protect themselves. So that is also where this resource component comes in and where equity is so critical to making this disease stop and also getting the information and the resources to people who need them the most.', '04:49': ""CA: And in a pandemic, the people who need them the most, the most vulnerable, as you say, are probably also -- That's where the disease is spreading a lot. It's in everyone's interest to do this. You're not just making this sort of, wonderful, equity moral point that we've got to help these people. It's actually in all of our interest, right?"", '05:08': ""JM: Yes. Yes, we are one humanity, and any disease, any infectious disease that is spreading is a threat to all of us. And that is one of the pieces, there's the moral imperative, there is the epidemiologic imperative, that if you can't control these diseases everywhere, that it's a threat anywhere. And so as we look to the kind of society we want to live in, good health is something that gives us all so much return on our investment."", '05:43': ""CA: Now, some countries were able to use contact tracing almost to shut down the pandemic before it took off in that country. The US was unable to do that, and some people have taken the view that therefore, contact tracing became irrelevant, that the strategy was mitigation, shut everything down. You've argued against that, that even in a process of lockdown that actually contact tracing plays a key role. Help us understand the scale, when there's a lot of cases, the scale of tracing, both cases and everyone they may have been in contact with and their contacts. It quickly gets to a huge problem."", '06:23': ""JM: It's massive."", '06:24': 'CA: What sort of workforce do you need to make a difference at this moment, where the US is at?', '06:32': 'JM: It\'s massive. I mean, the scale is massive, and we should not take that lightly. And we don\'t, at Partners In Health. I mean, we are willing to try to figure this out, and I always feel that if we could stop Ebola in some of the poorest countries in the world, of course we ought to do it here, and was it too late when there were 28,000 deaths in Ebola? Sure, it\'s always too late. We should have started earlier, but it\'s not too late to have an impact. And so there\'s three aspects of timing and scale. First is, the earlier you start, the better, right? And that\'s what we saw in Rwanda. They went from early testing and contact tracing, the first two cases entered into the country on March 15, and in one month, because of contact tracing, isolation and plenty of testing, they had held that case rate to 134 people. It\'s remarkable, it\'s remarkable. In the state of Georgia, where is home to the CDC, similar population size, about 12 million, from the first two cases in the first month, those cases became 4,400 cases. And in the country of Belgium, a similar population, those two cases became 7,400. So you do have to make scale to stop this. But the earlier you do it, the more benefits there are to your society and also to the other people who need medical services -- women who are pregnant, people who need their fracture repaired, because services themselves in the United States have been, you know, really hampered by this huge amount of COVID. So the first point is, it\'s always late, but it\'s never too late. Why? Because vulnerable populations are sitting ducks, and so imagine if one of your contacts was a nursing assistant who worked in a nursing home. We know that one nursing assistant can spread it throughout a nursing home. And is it important to identify that person as a contact and assure that he or she is able to remain quarantined? That is critical. And so it\'s hard to say, ""Well, it\'s not worth it if it\'s just one person, two persons."" Every life matters, and all of their contacts in the community of that person matters as well. So that\'s one thing. The second about scale is people need jobs right now. And they want to be part of a solution, and some of the frustration we see, the antilockdown movement, is really out of anger and frustration and feeling, ""What can we do?"" And so this gives people this feeling that they\'re part of a solution and can provide thousands of jobs. And then third, I would say, for us to reopen our schools, our churches, our workplaces, we have to know where the virus is spreading so that we don\'t just continue on this path. And so contact tracing provides the platform to control, but also to see outbreaks in real time popping up, and then respond promptly. So there are many reasons that we have to bring this to scale now. Even though it is tardy.', '09:57': ""CA: So especially as we have this pressure to go back to work, like, contact tracing has to be part of that strategy, or we're just inviting another disaster in a few weeks' time. Whatever you make of what's happened during this mitigation process."", '10:12': ""JM: Exactly, exactly. Exactly, and so that's such an important part, Chris, and something that we are just really keen to look at the United States in a different way. What are the long-term public health infrastructures that we need to protect us for the second wave, the third wave and in the future, for future pandemics?"", '10:36': 'CA: Whitney.', '10:38': ""Whitney Pennington Rodgers: You know, to that point, there is a question out there from one of our anonymous community members, about why contact tracing isn't already part of our public health system. It seems like it does make a lot of sense its a way to mitigate the spread of disease. Could you speak a little bit to that?"", '10:55': ""JM: I think many people have said -- and I am not a politician -- that our American health care infrastructure is built on treatment and not prevention. It's built on procedures and not keeping people well. And some of that was driven by profit, and some of that was driven by need, but I think we need to rethink how we deliver care in this environment."", '11:27': 'WPR: ""There is some fear and suspicion about privacy and contact tracing. How can we build trust in the process?""', '11:33': ""JM: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think there's fear about privacy and part of it comes from the idea of what contact tracing is. And I think that's why we feel strongly, is if you lead with the idea that it's care and it's trying to get resources and information and help to people, it seems very different than just, oh, who's sick, and who's a threat. And so fundamentally -- and that's why we're so pleased to be at this TED talk today -- is it's about communication, right? It's not about surveillance, it's about communication and care and support. That's one thing. And we'll be hearing from our colleagues on the tech side. There's ways to add tech, even to care, that it can be a resource for caring and communication. But there are ways to protect people's privacy and also to provide care, and public health has many laws attached to it. This is all done within the constructs of our state public health laws. And so I think some of the communication around this is, how do we take care of each other, how do we take care of the most vulnerable. And if we frame contact tracing as care, I think that starts a different kind of conversation."", '13:01': 'CA: Mm. So, Joia, can you just talk in a bit more detail about what it is that you are advising Massachusetts to do in terms of contact tracing. Give us a sense of the scale of it.', '13:14': 'JM: Yeah, so the scale -- thank you. You know, we are able now to make about 10,000 calls a day to contacts. So every new case that comes in, the case is investigated by someone on the phone, and then those investigations means writing down the names and the phone numbers of the persons you\'ve been in contact with for the time you were sick and a couple days before. And with those numbers then, the contact tracers -- And that\'s what we really redoubled the workforce and really expanded, more than doubled, to support the department of public health to do that contact tracing. So we have 1,700 people employed full time, with benefits, to call those contacts and say, ""Are you OK? This is the information you need,"" and then, and I think this is the critical piece, when someone doesn\'t have the information, then we have another cadre of people we call the resource care coordinators, who help that person, that contact, to do the things they need to do to protect themselves. It might be food delivery, it might be filing for unemployment benefits, it might be trying to get them medical care or a test. That piece is the care piece. And that is what turns social distancing from very regressive -- look at me in my beautiful house, social distancing -- to something that\'s progressive and paying attention to those who need the resources. So the scale is massive, with 1,700 employees hired to do this, but they are connected with local community food banks and churches and facilities and primary health care centers as well.', '15:07': 'CA: Thank you so much, Joia.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this talk, TED Fellow Michelle Borkin shows why collaboration between doctors and astronomers can lead to surprising discoveries.",0:09:33,9.55,192338,2012-01-08T14:54:03+00:00,"['TEDx', 'astronomy', 'collaboration', 'medicine', 'science', 'technology', 'medical imaging', 'space', 'medical research', 'visualizations']",['English'],Michelle Borkin,Physicist,"{'00:09': ""I believe that we can both unravel the mysteries of the universe and save human lives at the same time through interdisciplinary research. And I'm going to share with you today just one story, my story, that has crossed these paths."", '00:28': 'We start the in supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. It\'s one of the youngest ones in our galaxy, about 330 years old. An astronomy colleague approached me one day, and she had over eight years of magnificent data, just trying to understand the 3-D structure of this nebula, the supernova remnant. But she had no way to look at it. So I looked at the data with her and said, ""I think I can help you."" And although -- and this is all real data you\'re seeing on the screen above me -- this is the Hollywood rendering version, but the rough draft I made with her looks something more like this. And she was able to make novel discoveries about how supernovas explode and how shells explode within it, using a piece of software developed at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital here in Boston, called 3D Slicer. It was originally developed for looking at patients\' brain scans, doing surgical planning and doing 3-D renderings of anatomy. Who knew our solution was lurking just across the river?', '01:30': 'Now, people don\'t believe me when I tell them that astronomy and medical imaging -- these two seemingly different fields -- are really similar. So we\'re going to play a little game I like to call ""Which is which?"" I play this with new doctors and astronomers I work with. I\'m going to show you two images on the screen. One of them is biomedical and one of them is astronomical, and you have to pick them correctly in your head. So here is the first set. And again, one of these is biomedical and one is astronomical. I\'ll give you a second to make your little vote mentally. So it turns out the one on the left is some of the raw data of the supernova remnant we were just looking at, and on the right, we have an angiogram of a patient\'s heart and coronary arteries.', '02:16': ""OK, we're going to try another one. Now, this one is much closer to my daily bread and butter. Tell me which is which. And one of these is literally millimeters across, and the other is billions of miles. So, it turns out the one on the left is a confocal microscopy image of a human cornea, and on the right, we have a radio telescope image of the star-forming region NGC-1333. Now, aside from the fact that these images look similar and that doctors trying to find a tumor in a patient's brain or a young star forming is similar, the way the data comes from the machine or the telescope is remarkably similar."", '02:57': ""Here's an MRI scanner. And if you've never seen the raw data of a patient's brain, this is what it looks like. When the MRI scanner is acquiring the data, it goes in slices. So you can see the patient's nose, their eyes; it kind of progresses towards the middle of the head; you can start to see the cortex, and it steps through to the back of the brain. Now, believe it or not, telescopes, and particularly radio telescopes, operate in a similar manner. If we were to look at the raw data from these telescopes ... We're going to look at a nebula called M16. We start with this radio telescope at the front of the nebula, stepping back towards the middle of the nebula, just like the middle of the patient's brain -- those bright regions are where young stars are forming -- all the way to the back of the nebula, just like the back of the patient's head. Now, although the doctors are able to then take this data and look at it in 3-D and do surgical planning, this is cutting-edge, just about as good as you get with any astronomer, and this is what they have to look at to understand the 3-D structure and velocity's momentum in our universe. But we can do better."", '04:07': ""So, you might recognize this nebula more like this: the famous Hubble image of the Pillars of Creation or the Eagle Nebula. And, I'm going to fade this out onto a radio image, it's a false color in the background, and fade away the Hubble image you're used to. But we don't need to just look at this in 3-D, we can look at it in 2-D, and here I'm using a radiology tool kit called OsiriX."", '04:31': ""When I showed this to astronomer Marc Pound, whose data this is, he was amazed, because he had been trying so hard to study the impact of a young group of stars. And he had this theory that there's this wind crashing and tossing the pillars over, and it took him months to prove this with conventional visualization. But in one shot, you can see the shock wave of wind blasting through across to the left-hand side of the screen. Now, I don't think myself or any of my collaborators would've anticipated how far this has gone, and by sharing the medical technology with astronomy and astronomy with medical, we've been able to find new stars and supernova remnants, and revolutionize how you do heart diagnostics and look at data for different patients and organize it and data-mine it."", '05:17': ""I don't have time to show you all these great projects, but I'll show you one of them. This is a collaboration I've been working on, called The Multiscale Hemodynamics Project. I'm working with doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Now, what this represents is a novel way of doing heart disease diagnostics. And instead of the conventional invasive angiography, this is just a CT scan. What you see here are the coronary arteries. So you have your heart, and the arteries wrap around the outside. These are the arteries you worry about getting blocked and giving you a heart attack and killing you. So it's really important that we look at them."", '05:52': ""Now, this is a CT scan of a patient with a blood-flow simulation -- that's the coloring up there. That simulation was originally developed for studying the structure of DNA, and then the visualization was done with a tool kit called VisIt, originally developed for physics simulations. Interdisciplinary. My assignment was to try and come up with a new way of looking at this to make it optimal for the doctors and hospital: How can we make it the most efficient for them for a diagnosis?"", '06:22': 'And I came up with this image. It\'s 2-D; I took the whole artery and collapsed everything into a 2-D plane. I got some very quizzical looks when I showed this to the doctors originally. But I was inspired to do this representation from my astronomy work, where we\'ve been using these tree diagrams along the bottom to understand the structure of nebulae. Well, we were inspired in that work from the bioinformatics and genome community, where they use these tree diagrams to understand their gene expression data. They were inspired by the evolutionary biologists, who use these tree diagrams to understand how species evolve and are related, the first of which was drawn by Sir Charles Darwin. Here\'s an example from his ""Origin of the Species."" So, straight from Darwin, through biology, physics, astronomy, back to medical imaging. Interdisciplinary. One may say, ""Well, is this 2-D representation better?"" I did a study at Harvard Medical School to answer just that question.', '07:19': 'And it turns out, if you present the image on the left to a doctor, on average, they find about 39% of the high-risk regions that could explode or block your heart and kill you. On the right, we can do a little better, and they\'re able to find 62% of these high-risk, dangerous regions. But we can do even better, simply by changing the colors. The rainbow color map is a sin most doctors and astronomers and physicists are guilty of using. (Laughs) And it doesn\'t focus the best qualities of your visual system. The human system can see brightness variation, contrast ... not really good at that whole ""green-yellow-blue"" thing.', '08:01': 'But now, if you look in the shades of red and highlight the regions that are most diseased with dark red, now doctors can find 91% of the high-risk regions, simply by changing the colors.', '08:12': '(Applause)', '08:15': 'And I would have never known the importance of color if it was not for my computer science and visualization collaborators showing this to me. So again: interdisciplinary collaboration.', '08:25': ""How do you even get a collaboration like this? In the case of astronomical medicine, it started with a Harvard Astronomy professor, Alyssa Goodman, serendipitously meeting a computer scientist and imaging specialist from Brigham and Woman’s Hospital, and their recruitment of a very adventurous, open-minded, young student. (Laughter) And from there, it has exploded: we've pulled in cardiologists and computer scientists and radiologists and astronomers, physicists, chemists, computational physicists -- I mean, we've brought so many people together. And it's been enlightening to share domains and information across borders. And we're still going. And although most of the people up on the screen are from Harvard or Harvard Med, now we cross different institutions and continents to work together."", '09:11': ""All I can say is, it has just been wonderful. We're continuing to make new discoveries. And I just urge you: attend conferences not in your own domain, read books and journals not in your own discipline, watch TED talks and come to events like this and say hi to the neighbor sitting next to you, because you really never know where your next great idea is going to come from."", '09:33': 'Thank you.', '09:35': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Laughter) But not in the sense that you\'re thinking. I know I\'m a politician. I\'ll save that for another day. I\'m here to try and encourage you to take up a leadership role in public service in your country and on your continent. I\'m here to convince you that your country and your continent need you - not later, not when you\'re older and more experienced, but now - and that whether you realize it or not, your country\'s politics are going to be doomed to fail unless you\'re willing to get involved right now. So my recruitment pitch comes with a single disclaimer: I resigned from public office 18 months ago. (Laughter) I did it in order to take stock of my time in office, to think about the work that I had done, to capacitate myself with skills, knowledge, contacts, allies and experiences, and to find a little bit of personal and professional perspective. It\'s one of the best decisions I think I\'ve ever made. I imagine that some time during the next 18 minutes while I\'m pitching you, you\'re going to think, ""Yeah, it\'s easy for you to say I should go into public service. You\'ve already done it and you\'ve left."" But I hope I\'ll be able to convince you that, in fact, we all find ourselves in exactly the same boat right now. Because being outside of politics for 18 months has reminded me just how important it is and just how much the political landscapes in my country and in your countries and on our continent are truly lacking in good leadership and political talent. So, I want to make a deal with you. I\'m not going to return to active politics unless you come with me. (Laughter) I\'m not going to do it alone. I won\'t go back unless I can convince smart, entrepreneurial, highly skilled, talented, experienced young Africans like yourselves and millions more like you across the continent, that the best chance that our countries have, not just for survival but for lasting prosperity, is if our most talented citizens step forward and make themselves available, either for political party, leadership or for public service and government. So over the next 16-or-so minutes that are remaining, I\'m going to alternately flatter you, as I just have, (Laughter) I\'m going to challenge you, I\'m going to talk to you about my experiences, about a couple of facts and figures; I may even frighten you a little bit. And it\'ll be entirely worth it if that fear convinces you of the urgency of the point in history that we find ourselves in today. Everything I say today will be in service of a single objective: convincing you, showing you, that your countries need you; that Africa\'s prosperity may depend on many things - entrepreneurialism, industrial development, health reform, social upliftment - but that all of these hinge upon the success of politics and government in our countries. I can\'t begin a talk about public service, of course, without honoring my former president Nelson Mandela, the father of democratic South Africa. (Cheers) (Applause) President Mandela passed away on this day in 2013. I really believe that when the people of my country look back on the day that he passed away, it\'ll be seen as an inflection point in South Africa\'s history. The day we decided whether we could, indeed, go it alone without him. What\'s written in those history books will depend entirely on whether this generation, which includes all of you sitting in this room, recognizes that the time has come for us to take up the work that President Mandela left for us, before that work is captured by people who would use power and politics for empty vanity and personal gain. I\'m referring, of course, to the young man who was here in London this very past week. Defiling the name of the visionary leader, the intellectual and political strategist, the formidable athlete, the Prince of the Abathembu nation who served as a South Africa\'s first democratic president. The young man who tried to taint President Mandela\'s legacy with a few throwaway lines, all in service of getting cheap headlines, which he got. People like this, who we leave public service to when we stay out of the fray of public service, are the reason your country and my country needs you and needs us. So let us begin. I want to first talk to you about the African diaspora. You may have heard about a study in 2013 that revealed that cash transfers from Africans living outside of the continent have now begun to exceed donor aid from foreign countries into Africa. (Applause) In 2012, total remittances to Africa stood at 60 billion dollars while in the same year, official development aid to Sub-Saharan Africa totalled 44.6 billion by comparison. Now, this got me thinking. If we can do such great work with our money from outside of Africa, what can we do with our skills, our talent, our experiences, our education and our passion for our countries and for our continent? I\'ve spent the past semester at the Harvard Kennedy School as a fellow at the Institute of Politics. I ran a seminar which was called ""How to build a democracy? Lessons from South Africa."" It was also about Zimbabwe and Malawi.  And it wasn\'t intended to make it seem like we got everything right in South Africa, but it was asking the critical question: Now that we have this legacy of peaceful transition, of constitutionalism, of difficult negotiations, which were very, very difficultly gotten, are we going to be successful in entrenching that democracy and making it last into the future? Now, one of the benefits of being an African in an academic setting like New England is that other African students reach out to you, they want to talk to you, and many of them express to you their desire to enter public service. So I had students knocking down my door, wanting to talk to me in office hours about the fact that they have Ghanean parents but they were born in Texas. They really wanted to give back to Ghana, but they\'re afraid that if they go home, nobody will take them seriously as real Africans. I had students who said they had families, wives, children, husbands, partners to take care of, perhaps they were better off staying in the United States and providing for their families back home rather than going back and getting into public service. This got me thinking about the question of skills remittance, of talent remittance, of social and political remittance. If these young people have the passion to give back to their communities monetarily, imagine how different our politics would be if those same skills, influence, leadership, talent were put at work in service of the public good. And that includes all of you in this room because many of you are also part of the diaspora. I\'m here to recruit you. I\'m here to make a deal with you. I\'m not going back unless I take you with me. (Laugther) Now, I know that most of you, if not the vast majority of you, are completely fed up, turned off, discouraged, disgusted by politics, either in your country, in this country, all over the world. Perhaps you are discouraged by the fact that governments are slow to deliver. Perhaps they\'re inefficient.  Perhaps they are thoroughly corrupt and rotten to the core. Perhaps they\'re responsible for conflicts that have claimed lives and livelihoods in the countries from which you come. So why would you sink your time and your energies into such a compromised system? One of the most powerful analyses of conflict, inefficiency, corruption, stagnation which I\'ve encountered in recent months is the question of a political economy. There is a reason that our governments are not performing as they should. It\'s not just because of a failure within the system. Consider the political economy of conflict and corruption in your own country. Why is it so difficult to overcome? Who is making money or amassing power because things don\'t work the way they should? Where does the back stop? Who has an incentive to keep the system dysfunctional? And how can we work together to overcome their total infection of the system, to ensure that we don\'t lose our grip on the very principle of democratic governance? The answer, I\'m afraid, because you were born into this political time, is simply by taking over - you have to get involved. There\'s no way around it. You have to join political organizations in numbers large enough to influence change from within. You have to actively seek to take up a leadership role in government, in the state, in the public service and deftly but decisively move its priorities to where they should be: not in the service of people who want to amass power and money for themselves, but to better the lives of the highest number of people. There will always be government, whether we like it or not, whether we find it palatable or not. But there won\'t always be democracy. If we ignore politics, the people who have been quietly lobbying our governments to prioritize development ahead of democracy, these are the people who will have their way, and the systems that we now take for granted will dissolve before our eyes. When I was campaigning in South Africa last year for the 2014 general election, the voter registration numbers looked a little bit like this, six months before the election: 23% of potential voters in the 18-to-19-year-old age group were registered to vote. In the age group 20 to 29 years old, 55% were registered. And from 30 upwards, the number varied from 79 to 100%; in fact, there were more people aged 80 and over who were registered than were in the census numbers in South Africa. Imagine that. Fully 100% of people over a certain age consider voting to be an indispensable right, 21 years into democracy, and do not shirk their responsibility to register and turn out at the polls. But in the 18-to-19-year-old age group - and we must remember 19 is the average age on our continent; 26 is the average age in South Africa - the number is 23% to 55%. What\'s the political economy of voter apathy? Who benefits when we stay out of the system? Who gets to keep the status quo and empower themselves and enrich themselves and continue to infect our political system like a cancer. Who banks by us continuing with the status quo? Now even as I say all of this to you, that your country and your continent need you to enter public service, I know that if you take up my challenge, you\'re going to face huge amounts of resistance - all because of these political economies that I have just described. I did. I was told that I was too young. I was too female. (Laughter) I didn\'t have enough experience though no one could define what experience was enough. I had too much of a white accent; I wasn\'t a real African. I straightened my hair and wore weaves; I wasn\'t a real African. We should be honest about the things that hold people back from entering public service - humiliation, degradation; it\'s not an easy road - but all of these things should illustrate to you the extent to which the status quo is designed to enrich and empower a few at the expense of the many, and it should impart to you the urgency of you, as a generation, of now getting involved in public service to change that very culture. And if you decide to enter public service, you may even be tempted to believe some of these criticisms. They\'re designed to keep you out; that\'s how gatekeeping works. Somebody is benefiting from the absence of excellence and disruption in politics and government. But these are challenges that have to be faced on. There is no other route; there is no wishing this away. They are the reason that your country and your continent need you. We have this thing in politics in Africa; it\'s called the ""big man."" The cult of personality - we\'ve all heard different terminologies for it. In South Africa, in particular, this entails waiting for a great person to come and save us from ourselves. Currently, we\'re waiting for Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma or [inaudible] to come and save South Africa from itself, to save us from the mess that we find ourselves in that perhaps another big man put us in. But how can a single personality be held responsible for building or for running a whole nation? And where do we turn when they fail? If we haven\'t cultivated any kind of pipeline of energetic, young people who wanted to enter public service now or in the future and, critically, who can do the job better, are we doomed to always have to choose between mediocrity and ego, and mediocrity and ego? Is that it? Is that all our government will ever be? Or worse: Are we going to stand by while presidents change constitutions so they can serve a third term and a fourth term and a fifth term, claiming that three million people signed a petition stating that they are the only person who can do the job? (Laughter) (Applause) Is that what we\'ll do? Now, there\'s a new energy around entrepreneurism and innovation and growth in Africa today. But that energy isn\'t going to translate into lasting prosperity unless we get our politics right. Political leaders who are gatekeepers of the status quo will claim that any success is their success. They\'ll centralize power, and they\'ll demand that we all be grateful for those little green shoots of achievement, and then they\'ll claim that nobody else can do the job. They\'ll argue that development must come first, freedom can come later, and that they are the best benevolent dictator to do the job. They\'ll take your political voice from you when times are a little bit good, and when times go bad, they will refuse to give it back. There is no prosperity for our continent without a vibrant, diverse, and truly competitive politics, founded upon excellence, transparency and commitment to the public good. Our politics will not have any of these qualities unless talented, young people, the best people, step forward at this moment in Africa\'s history, when we\'re emerging from that stereotype of the dark continent, the hopeless continent, and commit themselves to public service. We must run for office. We must work in the civil service. We must disrupt the political status quo. We must prevent the rush to the bottom. You really are the ones that you have been waiting for. There are no great saviors waiting somewhere in the wings to save us from future problems. There\'s nobody who is waiting in the wings to come and save us from ourselves; there\'s just us. And I\'m not going back without you. (Laughter) So, will you take up the challenge? Thank you. (Cheers) (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But as he embarked on yet another life running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need for political reform.', '00:41': 'Milk strongly believed that tight knit neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal approach to local government.', '01:00': 'This philosophy led him to run for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative for his own district, which included the heart of American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as political outsiders. But Milk refused to downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality.', '01:47': 'But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, the ""mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay public officials in US history.', '02:31': 'Elated, Milk arrived in office determined to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national momentum, especially in the form of California’s Proposition 6.', '02:53': 'The proposition, which sought to make it illegal for homosexuals to work in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign against hate.', '03:32': 'On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was gaining traction. But just twenty days after this inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.', '03:51': 'Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those he called ""radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk\'s murder, thousands marched by candlelight through the city.', '04:15': 'In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar throughout the city in what became known as the White Night Riots.', '04:32': 'But even after his death, Milk continued to preach his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total of three different tapes to be played in the event of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome in the fight against injustice: ""I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door…”'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So bear with me for a few minutes, and know that after this, things will get lighter and brighter. So let\'s start.', '00:20': 'I know that many of you have heard the traveler\'s adage, ""Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints."" Well, I\'m going to say I don\'t think that\'s either as benign nor as simple as it sounds, particularly for those of us in industries who are portraying people in poor countries, in developing countries and portraying the poor. And those of us in those industries are reporters, researchers and people working for NGOs; I suspect there are a lot of us in those industries in the audience. We\'re going overseas and bringing back pictures like this: of the utterly distressed or the displaced or the hungry or the child laborers or the exotic.', '01:00': ""Now, Susan Sontag reminds us that photographs, in part, help define what we have the right to observe, but more importantly, they are an ethics of seeing. And I think right now is a good time to review our ethics of seeing, as our industries of reporting and research and NGO work are collapsing and changing, in part, by what's being driven by what's happening in the economy. But it's making us forge new relationships. And those new relationships have some fuzzy boundaries. I worked at the edge of some of these fuzzy boundaries, and I want to share with you some of my observations."", '01:36': ""My ethics of seeing is informed by 25 years as a reporter covering emerging economies and international relations. And I believe in a free and independent press. I believe that journalism is a public good. But it's getting harder to do that job, in part, because of the massive layoffs, because the budgets for international reporting aren't there anymore, new technologies and new platforms begging new content, and there are a lot of new journalisms. There's activist journalism, humanitarian journalism, peace journalism, and we are all looking to cover the important stories of our time. So we're going to NGOs and asking them if we can embed in their projects. This is in part because they're doing important work in interesting places."", '02:26': 'That\'s one example here: this is a project I worked on in the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. NGOs understand the benefits of having reporters tag along on their team. They need the publicity, they are under tremendous pressure, they\'re competing in a very crowded market for compassion. So they\'re also looking to reporters and to hire freelance reporters to help them develop their public relations material and their media material. Now, researchers are also under pressure. They\'re under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy. So they\'re collaborating with reporters, because for many researchers, it\'s difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story. And the benefit for reporters is that covering field research is some of the best work out there. You not only get to cover science, but you get to meet interesting scientists, like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling, she, of the magic research high tops there. And it was a discussion with Revi that brought us to the edge of the researcher and reporter, that fuzzy boundary. And I said to her, ""I was looking forward to going to developing countries and doing research and covering stories at the same time."" She said, ""I don\'t think so, girlfriend."" And that confusion, that mutual confusion, drove us to publish a paper on the conflicting ethics and the contradictory practices of research and reporting. We started with the understanding that researchers and reporters are distant cousins, equally storytellers and social analysts. But we don\'t see nor portray developing communities the same way.', '04:10': ""Here's a very classic example. This is Somalia, 1992. It could be Somalia today. And this is a standard operating procedure for much of the news video and the news pictures that you see, where a group of reporters will be trucked in, escorted to the site of a disaster, they'll produce their material, take their pictures, get their interviews, and then they'll be escorted out. This is decidedly not a research setting."", '04:36': ""Now, sometimes, we're working on feature stories. This is an image I took of a woman in Bhongir Village in Andhra Pradesh in India. She's at a microfinance meeting. It's a terrific story. What's important here is that she is identifiable. You can see her face. This also is not a research picture. This is much more representative of a research picture. It's a research site: you see young women accessing new technologies. It's more of a time stamp, it's a documentation of research. I couldn't use this for news. It doesn't tell enough, and it wouldn't sell."", '05:14': 'But then, the differences are even deeper than that. Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates that researchers are under. They are under some very strict rules governed by their university research review boards when it comes to content and confidentiality. Researchers are mandated to acquire document-informed consent. Well, as a reporter, if I hang a microphone on someone, that is consent. And when it comes to creating the story, I\'ll fact-check as a reporter, but I don\'t invite company to create that story, whereas social scientists, researchers, and particularly participatory researchers, will often work on constructing the narrative with the community. And when it comes to paying for information, ""checkbook journalism"" is roundly discouraged, in part, because of the bias it introduces in the kind of information you get. But social scientists understand that people\'s time is valuable so they pay them for that time.', '06:13': ""So while journalists are well-placed to convey the beauty of the scientific process -- and I would add, the NGO process -- what about the warts? What happens if a research project is not particularly well-designed, or an NGO project doesn't fulfill its goals? Or the other kind of warts, you know, what happens after dark when the drinks happen. Research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments; you make good friends while you're doing good work. But there's a little bit of Johnnie Walker journalism after dark, and what happens to that line between embedded and in-bedded? Or what do you do with the odd and odious behavior? The point is that you'll want to negotiate in advance what is on the record and off the record."", '07:06': ""I'm going to turn now to some NGO imagery which will be familiar to some of you in this audience."", '07:14': '(Video) Narrator: For about 70 cents, you can buy a can of soda, regular or diet. In Ethiopia, for just 70 cents a day, you can feed a child like Jamal nourishing meals. For about 70 cents, you can also buy a cup of coffee. In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.', '07:41': ""Leslie Dodson: Now, there's some very common imagery that's been around for 40 years. That's part of Sally Struthers's famine campaign. Some of it is very familiar; it's the Madonna and child. Women and children are very effective in terms of NGO campaigns. We've been looking at this imagery for a long time, for hundreds and hundreds of years; the Madonna and child. Here is [Duccio], and here is Michelangelo. My concern is: Are we one-noting the genders in our narratives of poverty in developing communities? Do we have women as victims, and are men only the perpetrators? Are they the guys with the AK-47s or the boy soldiers? Because that doesn't leave room for stories like the man who's selling ice cream at the refuge camp in Southern Sudan, where we did a project, or the stories of the men who are working on the bridge over the Blue Nile. So I wonder: Are these stories inconvenient to our narratives?"", '08:44': ""And what about this narrative? This is a for-profit game, and its aim is to make development fun. One question is: Did they inadvertently make fun of? Another set of questions is: What are the rights of these children? What rights of publicity or privacy do they have? Did they get paid? Should they get paid? Should they share in the profit? This is a for-profit game. Did they sign talent waivers? I have to use these when I'm working with NGOs and documentary filmmakers here in the States. In the States, we take our right to privacy and publicity very seriously. So what is it about getting on a long-haul flight that makes these rights vaporize?"", '09:31': ""I don't want to just pick on our friends in the gaming arts; I'll turn to the graphic arts, where we often see these monolithic, homogeneous stories about the great country of Africa. But Africa is not a country, it's a continent. It's 54 countries and thousands and thousands of languages. So my question is: Is this imagery productive, or is it reductive? I know that it's popular."", '10:01': 'USAID just launched their campaign ""Forward"" -- FWD: Famine, War and Drought. And by looking at it, you would think that was happening all the time, all over Africa. But this is about what\'s happening in the Horn of Africa. And I\'m still trying to make sense of Africa in a piece of Wonder Bread. I\'m wondering about that.', '10:24': 'Germaine Greer has wondered about the same things and she says, ""At breakfast and at dinner, we can sharpen our own appetites with a plentiful dose of the pornography of war, genocide, destitution and disease."" She\'s right. We have sharpened our appetites. But we can also sharpen our insights. It is not always war, insurrection and disease. This is a picture out of South Sudan, just a couple of months before the new country was born.', '10:53': 'I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing. I ask myself whether my pictures are pandering, whether they contribute to stereotypes, whether the images match the message, am I complacent or am I complicit?', '11:16': 'Thank you.', '11:17': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was 24, I found myself living in a small beach town by the name of Naples, Florida. I was looking for something new. I was 24. I\'m 29 now. And in that small coastal town, I was the only Deaf resident. In fact, the closest deaf person was a few hours away by car. And all of the friends and acquaintances that I had made could hear. I didn\'t mind though; I wanted something new. Lucky for me, Naples, Florida is home to some of the U.S. Olympics volleyball team, where they reside and train through the year. So I had a fantastic opportunity to play with them every day I could. And we\'d hit the court all the time, either indoors or out at the beach; it was great. Lucky for them, I happen to be very good at volleyball. So one night after a great game, a friend and I pull up some chairs by the water to watch the sun go down and chat. And he looks over at me and he asks me a question that completely blew me away. To be honest, in 24 years of my life, nobody had ever asked me. And his question was simple: ""Have you ever wished you could hear?"" I looked at him for a second and thought, Where did that come from? Then I took a moment and I realized while we had been sitting there, I could see waves coming in and crashing on the beach. He could hear that. Obviously, I couldn\'t. My entire world is completely silent. To our left, people had taken over the court and were playing volleyball, cheering each other on. To our right, a mother was playing and laughing with her baby. And behind us, cars and ATVs had passed by all day without me even noticing. So, I was quick to answer: ""No, of course not. I\'ve never wished I could hear. I\'ve never wished that because I love who I am."" And you may be wondering, How do I love myself as a Deaf man? Well, first, I was born deaf. My deafness shaped my childhood, and it\'s all I\'ve ever known. So my perspective on life and my experience of the world is very different. My outlook and my life has involved experiences that many of you have never had to encounter as hearing people. My culture, something I embody and cherish, has always been Deaf. My perspective on life is completely different. The experiences I\'ve had, something I hold most dear, have taught me to love myself as a Deaf man. To illustrate that point, if I were to walk into a job interview with a panel of hearing peers, and if I were to approach that meeting wishing that I could hear, wishing that I could speak like them, and focusing on that imbalance, do you think that I would do very well? Obviously not, right? Because in the back of my mind I\'m focusing on the negative, therefore creating a negative outcome, and I\'m certain I wouldn\'t get that job. But, if instead, I use my difference as an advantage and an asset, I know that as a Deaf man I have so much to offer their company. My experiences growing up are much different from theirs. And knowing that allows me to approach the interview positive. I can go into that meeting and confidently tell them how they will benefit from hiring a Deaf man for a multitude of reasons. And I can walk out with that job because it\'s all about mindset. So I say first and foremost to love yourself. So as I mentioned, the first reason I love myself is my upbringing. But many of you may not know that I come from a rather large family. I have two brothers who are also Deaf along with my parents, my grandparents, and yes, even my great-grandparents as well. I\'m the fourth generation in a beautiful family with over 25 Deaf members. Born to Deaf parents who understood the Deaf experience, they knew exactly how to raise me. They knew how to provide me with the best opportunities and to support me. From day one of my existence, my parents gave me language, access to education, and love. Growing up, my life was perfect. Imagine, like many of you born to hearing parents, I never noticed barriers that simply weren\'t there. I\'m sure many of you felt your life was normal, the same way that I did. Coming from a Deaf family, my world, in every way, was a utopia. When it came time for my parents to enroll me in school, they already knew that I would go to the Deaf school. I would learn in an environment that was designed for me. At that time, all of my peers, and teachers, and even the superintendent was Deaf. So, I was still in my perfect world. I was in an environment where I could grow and where I could thrive. And I had no problems; it was perfect for me. And many people don\'t believe that, but it\'s true. For me, the Deaf community, our world, was the perfect world for me. And I remember in the summer before fifth grade, I was ready to go back to school, and I asked my mom to go to a public school. She thought I was crazy. She said, ""What?! No! Public school, it\'s all hearing kids. The Deaf school is a perfect fit."" And I said, ""No, I want to learn what those students are learning. I want to see what their classrooms are like. What are public school teachers like?"" So upon my insistence she enrolled me. And after two weeks of frustration, I came home pleading to go back to the Deaf school. She listened very sympathetically and told me, ""Nope, too bad."" I was floored. She told me I needed to stick it out for a year because I needed to learn how to interact with my hearing peers, and that if I gave it a little patience, I would learn so much about the world around me. Because the reality is the world is hearing. I was the only Deaf kid in the entire school. Of course, I always had hearing friends, but they could sign like me. So that year I gained a lot of insight. I couldn\'t be involved in any of the school organizations. My friends never learned enough sign to communicate. And every time I tried to play a sport, I\'d get benched. The basketball coach told me a Deaf kid could never help the team win a game. And I was athletic. So after a year, I went back to the Deaf school where I realized that\'s my home. That\'s my community. And my community is where I can thrive. I got involved in the classroom again, joined a bunch of school organizations, and got back on the basketball team, where I helped win many games. So it\'s without hesitation that I can say the Deaf community is in fact my home. After graduating high school, I was accepted into the only Deaf university in the world: Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. It was there I gained my degree in mathematics with the intention of becoming a better teacher than the ones I had growing up. Like many of you, I sat through some math teachers who seriously sucked. (Laughter) I wanted to be a good math teacher. But I also wanted to be a good role model for those students. So as time got closer to graduation, of course I was nervous. I started questioning if I had made the right decision. And I decided to get out - to get out of my comfort zone and to travel the world. Since then, I\'ve been to over 43 countries. And the funny thing about when I travel is that I\'m constantly meeting hearing people who say, ""Nyle, you are so brave. How do you travel like this? Isn\'t it hard to be Deaf and travel? It looks impossible."" And let me tell you, traveling as a Deaf person, I think, is actually much easier than traveling for hearing people. Because sign language is something that gives me access to a much larger world. I\'ll tell you one of my favorite stories. A few years ago, I was in south Sicily perusing a flea market, when I walked into a butcher shop, and standing there is an American tourist trying to ask the butcher where the meat he was slicing is sourced from. So the Sicilian man, speaking no English, is gesturing, right? And you know Italians gesture. He\'s trying to explain where the meat comes from, and it\'s going right over the head of the tourist. So watching this very comical breakdown in conversation, I\'m understanding everything perfectly, so I pull out a paper and a pen, and I translate what the butcher is saying, and I hand it over to the tourist and explain, ""This is what he\'s trying to tell you."" So there I am, the Deaf person translating for two hearing people. And in that situation, they\'re the ones disabled, not me. (Laughter) While that story is ironic, it happens so many times when I meet people in other countries. I\'m always amazed to meet locals in other countries, and their ability to gesticulate and communicate with me, often quite easily. And I would always tell myself to visit the local Deaf schools and to make time to meet Deaf locals. But with every new Deaf school that I saw, I was sad to see that their schools were in terrible condition, and their education was greatly lacking. Often, I just couldn\'t believe my eyes. When I would meet Deaf adults, I realized a common thread very quickly. They either didn\'t have the same level of education I did or their language was incomplete, making it hard to communicate. They\'d often complain to me that the system had failed them, and now they struggled to find work. And I kept asking myself, why is this happening, and why is this happening so often? Why am I somehow more fortunate? Growing up, I thought every deaf person in the world was like me and had the same opportunities that I did. So in returning to the United States, I decided to do some research on the topic. And what I found shocked me. There are currently more than 70 million deaf people in the world with only two percent of them having access to education in sign languages. Which means millions upon millions of deaf children not receiving the education they need, also known as education deprivation. I also learned that over 75 percent of hearing parents don\'t sign to communicate with their deaf children. Which is astonishing. Again, imagine millions and millions of deaf children without an education, without a language. Those children without language and access to education exhibit signs of brain damage. In my research, I also found that I\'m a part of an even smaller group. Ten percent of Deaf children come from Deaf parents like mine. Only 10 percent. I\'m incredibly lucky. I had access to language, an education, and I had parents who loved me and put me on a path to success. I wouldn\'t be who I am today without any of those things. So it was clear to me that something needed to be done. I got to work in setting up my own foundation - the Nyle DiMarco Foundation - with the goal of improving the lives of millions of deaf people around the world. We\'ve since partnered with another Deaf organization in the United States to introduce legislation - a bill that requires all deaf children have access to language between the ages of zero and five, setting up benchmarks for their success. Because before the age of five, children have the ability to acquire a foundation in language, readying them for the classroom and for a successful life. After the age of five, that critical language acquisition window closes. I\'m working to give every deaf child in the world a future filled with a rich language and the opportunities I was lucky enough to receive. But the Deaf community cannot do it alone; we need you to become our allies and join us in making the world more knowledgeable. We need you to join us, to fight with us and for us in the ongoing battle of affording children what they need to thrive. So before I go, I want to teach you two very simple but important signs. The first is ""love."" The second, ""yourself."" Follow me: Love yourself. Brilliant! A-plusses all around! Thank you.

One of these is ethanol, which we consume in alcoholic drinks. It travels through the bloodstream to tiny air sacs in the lungs, passing into exhaled air at a concentration 2,000 times lower, on average, than in the blood.', '00:49': 'When someone breathes into a breathalyzer, the ethanol in their breath passes into a reaction chamber. There, it’s converted to another molecule, called acetic acid, in a special type of reactor that produces an electric current during the reaction. The strength of the current indicates the amount of ethanol in the sample of air, and by extension in the blood.', '01:11': 'In addition to the volatile organic compounds like ethanol we consume in food and drink, the biochemical processes of our cells produce many others. And when something disrupts those processes, like a disease, the collection of volatile organic compounds in the breath may change, too. So could we detect disease by analyzing a person’s breath, without using more invasive diagnostic tools like biopsies, blood draws, and radiation?', '01:40': 'In theory, yes, but testing for disease is a lot more complicated than testing for alcohol. To identify diseases, researchers need to look at a set of tens of compounds in the breath. A given disease may cause some of these compounds to increase or decrease in concentration, while others may not change— the profile is likely to be different for every disease, and could even vary for different stages of the same disease.', '02:07': 'For example, cancers are among the most researched candidates for diagnosis through breath analysis. One of the biochemical changes many tumors cause is a large increase in an energy-generating process called glycolysis. Known as the Warburg Effect, this increase in glycolysis results in an increase of metabolites like lactate which in turn can affect a whole cascade of metabolic processes and ultimately result in altered breath composition, possibly including an increased concentration of volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. But the Warburg Effect is just one potential indicator of cancerous activity, and doesn’t reveal anything about the particular type of cancer. Many more indicators are needed to make a diagnosis.', '02:57': 'To find these subtle differences, researchers compare the breath of healthy people with the breath of people who suffer from a particular disease using profiles based on hundreds of breath samples. This complex analysis requires a fundamentally different, more versatile type of sensor from the alcohol breathalyzer. There are a few being developed. Some discriminate between individual compounds by observing how the compounds move through a set of electric fields. Others use an array of resistors made of different materials that each change their resistance when exposed to a certain mix of volatile organic compounds.', '03:35': 'There are other challenges too. These substances are present at incredibly low concentrations— typically just parts per billion, much lower than ethanol concentrations in the breath. Compounds’ levels may be affected by factors other than disease, including age, gender, nutrition, and lifestyle. Finally, there’s the issue of distinguishing which compounds in the sample were produced in the patient’s body and which were inhaled from the environment shortly before the test.', '04:05': 'Because of these challenges, breath analysis isn’t quite ready yet. But preliminary clinical trials on lung, colon, and other cancers have had encouraging results. One day, catching cancer early might be as easy as breathing in and out.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At TEDxPortofSpain, Mark Raymond encourages city governments to let go of their old notions of success and consider the balance of environment, economy, and society to design cities for social change.",0:19:44,19.73333333,181290,2012-03-18T14:17:57+00:00,"['TEDx', 'architecture', 'cities', 'design', 'social change', 'sustainability']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'English', 'Español', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '한국어']",Mark Raymond,Architect,"{'00:04': ""We've been asked to address the theme of changing conversations. And I think certainly in the field that I'm in, that's a really important point to be at. From the discourses that are going on within architecture as well as throughout society, I think it is time to change the way that we look at things. As an architect, I've been involved with architectural projects, with urban planning projects, and more recently, projects that engage much more with the landscape. Now I can see so many opportunities and so many ways in which design can contribute and has the capacity to effect social change. And that's what I'm going to talk to you today about."", '00:45': ""Starting off, I think it might be useful to talk a little bit about architecture, because I think for many people, architecture is a slightly mystical activity. Not many people know what architects do. A lot of the time, I'm not sure the architects know what they're doing. But we try, and it's important to try and embrace that and try and understand what that means. When I talk about architecture today, I'm not talking about the profession. I'm not talking about an activity that's pursued by a select group of people with some specialized knowledge. I'm talking about architecture in the bigger sense: architecture in terms of the room that we're in, architecture as a pervasive activity, architecture as the activity that is the creation of shelter, the creation of space, the design and the creation of spaces between buildings, the landscape. It's man's interaction with the landscape. Our construction of the built environment -- that's what I mean by architecture. It's not a specialized thing."", '01:47': ""And over the last, I suppose, 20 or 30 years, with the predominance of the internet and the wonderful and exciting advancements that are taking place in technology, one of the things that has happened is that our perception of the world has become commodified. It's become reduced in many ways to a perception that is two-dimensional. We spend a lot of our time, a lot of our lives, looking at the world through screens, whether it's our laptops or television screens or monitors at airports or in the workplace or even our telephones are now screens. And it has this effect of reducing our perception of the world. It expands it in many ways, but it can reduce it, it can turn into icons our idea or our notion of certain concepts or ideas that are, in fact, maybe a lot more pervasive than the two-dimensional image can convey. And I think that's true about architecture. I think we've grown accustomed to thinking about architecture in a really primarily two-dimensional way, in a flat way, that the building is about what it looks like, how it appears, it's visual commodity."", '02:54': ""But it's much more than that. It's much more than an aesthetic or just a sensory experience. That's very important, but it's much more than that. It's a complex operation. And a big part of architecture and a big part of design involves understanding the context in which that design exists or in which it's going to exist. It's having the imagination to try and predict or project where the building or where the urban space or where the landscape is going to be located, how it's going to be used, what are the operations, what are the activities that are going to take place in that space. And you might call those the programmatic aspects of architecture, the programmatic aspects of design. And I think that in recent times, we've tended to privilege or put at a higher level that visual sensory perception or desire about architecture ahead and in advance of those programmatic needs. We've tended to kind of create monuments, create icons that create a sensation or create effect, without really thinking through the value of the operation that those places or those spaces can affect. And it's in that zone or in that area that I think we need to start looking or trying to understand how architecture or how design can really impact on society, and how it can address some of the problems that we're facing."", '04:06': ""The big buzzword in design and in what I do and I think what everybody does is the idea of sustainability. Sustainability is an idea, a notion or a concept that's triangulated by three very important concepts or ideas: the environment, the economy and society. Well, the global economy seems to be currently in a kind of meltdown situation. A lot of work needs to be done there. The environment that we live in is challenged. We've got global warming, we've got rising tides, we've got all sorts of disasters taking place, all sorts of things happening that threaten the equilibrium of the world and the environment that we live in. And society itself is also challenged and threatened by some of the issues that we're faced with. I think we've heard about some of those issues today and the need to change the paradigm in which we perceive those things. It's really very crucial that we do that."", '05:04': ""So how does design impact that? How can how can I, as a designer, or anybody as a designer or any architect or how can society -- in what way can design impact on that, in what way can it affect that? I'm going to talk today about ways in which I think design can impact on society, very specifically on society, and how that idea of design can infiltrate the idea of society and work with society in the operations of society in this programmatic way to effect social change. This is an image of Frederick Street in the early part of the last century. And I think it's a good image in lots of ways. It seems like that little triangulation of the environment, the economy and society seems to be in a kind of balance. So it seems that in cities we can see that balance that cities are symbols or ciphers or ways in which we can we can understand the confluence of those forces."", '06:03': ""And through time, there have been times when cities have done that very successfully. There are lots of examples of very good cities which have found themselves at a specific moment in time at a point of balance or equilibrium. If we look at Port of Spain as a city, and we consider the idea that, once upon a time, Port of Spain was just a little cluster, a little fishing village at the mouth of the St. Ann's River. And yet it's grown to be such a big, complex conglomeration, a big conurbation of lots and lots of complex ideas."", '06:36': ""The Italian architect Aldo Rossi, a 20th-century architect who died at the end of the last century, made a very profound statement. He said architecture is the making of the city over time. I think that's a great statement, because it talks, on one level, about the individual production and manufacture of an object -- architecture -- and it talks about architecture as being a form of cultural production, as something that speaks to an issue or speaks to ideas that are bigger than the sum of the parts of the building, and it relates it to the city."", '07:07': ""It also suggested that it's a constant, dynamic, changing process. And I think that's a very important thing to understand, that it's also part of the program. It's nothing to do with visual, it's to do with the program. It's how does this evolve, what are the dynamics, what are the components, what are the elements that contribute to the unraveling and the creation of the city? It also speaks to the fact that the city is something that can be imagined. In the same way as we can conceive and imagine of a space or a building, we can conceive and imagine of a city. And it speaks to the idea of the individual and the collective. And it's that link -- the individual to the collective, the idea of the civitas, the idea of the society -- that I think is a really important axiom for understanding how design can infiltrate and how design can effect change."", '07:56': 'These are some images of how Port of Spain evolved over a relatively short period of 200 years, from a colonial plan that was developed following some ordinances sent out by the king of Spain, called the Laws of the Indies. Many cities in the Caribbean and Latin America were predicated and formulated on this. It was a gesture, it was a single design that addressed the needs and the requirements of those establishing cities and new colonies. And it expanded, and over time, as trade began to develop in Trinidad, the city expanded, and it grew, and it started appropriating, more and more, the surrounding landscape, until it grew to pretty much what we have today, or what we understand to be the city of Port of Spain.', '08:38': ""But as we all know, that process grew also on a kind of macro scale as well. We have the evolution and the development of this big conurbation that stretches from Port of Spain to the west and over to Arouca in the east and seems to be continuing. So we've developed into this concept or idea that far exceeds the original Laws of the Indies plan. And it's turned into a complex arrangement and matrix of infrastructures and complex issues, issues that, in many ways, have led to a lot of problems. They've led to a lot of infrastructural problems. And we share this with many, many cities in the world. Cities all over the world are expanding, they're increasing, they're undergoing the same type of development that we've undergone to the point where the original Port of Spain and the downtown Port of Spain that used to comprise the city, used to constitute the city, has now turned into this sort of megalopolis, this sprawl, and it's difficult to comprehend. And when we think of the problems, we think of the infrastructural problems: the water, the power, the traffic congestion, the crime, the segregation, the polarization that exists, the situation that has led to what's happened in this country recently with the state of emergency ... Sometimes it seems completely insurmountable. It seems like we've got to a point where we can't really control it in the way that we can control that original plan. We can't really control this anymore. It's almost as if we're victims of the city, rather than people that have willingly or willfully designed the city or formulated the city."", '10:09': 'Another phenomenon that has happened commensurate with these issues of size and scale of infrastructure is the predomination of what I would call ""typologies,"" different types of development. We\'re all familiar with the high-rise development. This is some buildings in Hong Kong, you know, the magnificent, tall structures that cost a fortune to build. But they predominate; it\'s almost as if you can\'t have a city unless you\'ve got a high-rise building in it. They\'re symbolic, they seem emblematic with modernity and development. And then shopping malls is another predominant type, another prevalent type that all cities want to have, the idea that you can concentrate all these shops and all this retail activity in one place and create an environment for people to come and do specific retail functions and purchase things and be in a specific place at a specific time. And then the highway, the idea of cutting through landscapes to create how it\'s to increase the speed with which we can get from one point to another. And then we also have suburban development. These are all typologies that are emblematic of the type of development that has taken place in modern cities, in Port of Spain and cities all over the world.', '11:18': ""Now, there's nothing wrong with shopping malls, there's nothing wrong with highways, and there's nothing wrong with high-rise buildings or suburban development. What is kind of wrong is that what we seem to be doing is privileging types or ways of building or ideas about building above other really very important ways of how we can conceive or how we imagine space. What about schools? What about parks? What about making streets that are really comfortable to walk on and the people are not confronting traffic noise and congestion all the time? Where is that in the equation?"", '11:52': ""It seems that with our focus on these types of structures and these typologies, which are motivated and driven primarily because they generate profit, they're part of an economic consumer system, they generate profit, that's why they're favored, that's why they are privileged above other types of development. But schools, parks, elements of cities that used to be really significant and really important are being diminished and marginalized as a consequence of the focus on this type of development. They're undermining the integrity of the city, they're undermining the capacity of the city to accommodate social interaction, to accommodate everybody, because the other thing is they're also exclusive. To work in a high-end office, you need to be qualified, you need to be educated, or you need to have access or the resources to get the qualifications or the training that allow you to get the job in there. If you don't have those, you work outside somewhere. We're not concerned about what those places are like, you just go and work somewhere else."", '12:54': ""Similarly, those people that used to live in the cities or used to live and contribute to the life of cities are being pushed out because buildings like high-rise buildings push them out. There's a premium on land price that pushes people out of cities. People can't go to shopping malls unless they've got cars, because those malls are generally located on the peripheries of cities. People can't go buy things in shopping malls, because they don't have enough disposable income; they're not going to spend money there. So those types of buildings, whilst they work for sectors of society, don't work for everybody. They're not equitable. Yet, an undue amount of attention is paid by government, by society on ensuring that those types of buildings proliferate, because they're seen as positive aspects of development -- at the expense of types of building and types of program that could be beneficial to everybody, types of program that encourage interaction, that encourage education, that encourage people to be with each other and encourage a sense of community. These types of development dissipate society, they disaggregate society, they polarize society. They create isolated groups of activity to which access depends upon how much money you've got in your pocket. It's a polarizing and negative force. We see it in this city, and we're seeing it more and more other cities."", '14:12': ""And what ends up happening is that we end up with this sort of stack, that's like a time bomb. At some point the system must collapse, it's really not sustainable. It's like the economic system in the world today -- it's really not a sustainable system, and we have to find ways of addressing it. Design can't provide the solution, but what it can address is some of the conditions that people live with. It can address some of the circumstances in which people find themselves, some of the areas of cities to which people have been shunted or pushed aside because they can no longer afford to live in the center, and they can't participate actively or fully in this consumerized, capitalized system. And we need to try and conceive of how we can transform these types of spaces, how we can integrate the activities that happen in these types of spaces within a bigger picture, how we can identify small moves or small gestures, whether through design or economic initiative or social initiative that effect change and that allow transformation of spaces that encourage and facilitate greater participation. And there are lots of ways of doing that. And whilst it might seem complex when we look at cities, when we look at the aggregate parts of cities, it may seem insurmountable. But if we try and isolate individual acts, individual ways of looking at things and formulate a program, a manner or way of understanding how we can do that, then we can get nearer to achieving or effecting some kind of social change."", '15:38': 'And there are examples in the world where that\'s been done. Barcelona is a really good example of a city where people sat down and collectively and actively tried to conceive of ways in which they could effect change, and they did it very successfully. And nearer to home, in Bogotá, Enrique Peñalosa, the mayor of Bogotá, when he took office, he decided, ""I\'m not going to spend billions of dollars on creating more highways. I\'m going to appropriate the funds I have, and I\'m going to create places -- parks that everybody can use, public spaces that people can use."" And as he created, more and more people came into those spaces. And those spaces were very effective in encouraging participation, encouraging senses of community amongst people, getting people to come together to forget what little trifling contests they had between each other, to start doing things together, to start moving around the city together and try to start acting together.', '16:32': ""So there are ways of doing it; there are models. And it comes back to this idea of program. What's our program? Well, I think we want to create equitable society. Then we want to create societies where there's active and equitable participation for everybody and where we can break down some of those inhibitions, those barriers. We can remove economic stigma, we can remove stigma around race, around where you live, around all those factors and try and bring people together in constructed and effective ways. In Trinidad, there are a number of examples. There are opportunities to do this all over the place."", '17:05': ""This is City Gate. It's the entrance to the city for tens of thousands of people. People come in and out of it every day. And yet, what they're confronted with is pretty bleak, horrid, grey, unwelcoming and sometimes unsafe because of all the traffic zooming around. And that space from City Gate that moves up to Independence Square could be a really wonderful experience, you know, with landscaping, with proper accommodation of the sort of facilities and amenities that people would need and would enjoy. It could become a really very important civic space."", '17:39': ""This is the Prado in Havana. It's just a notional idea of how that space could be treated so that movement in and out of the city every day becomes a really important and uplifting transition from the maxi taxi to the place where you work. In San Fernando we've got the waterfront, which is a really very beautiful part of this landscape in this country, but is in complete neglect. There are some really beautiful, fine examples of 19th-century architecture that form, in and of themselves, some really fine spaces."", '18:09': ""We need to we need to look at those spaces, we need to appropriate them, we need to determine uses for those spaces that would encourage all types of activity: spaces for performance, spaces for children to play in and learn that it's cool and it's OK and it's fun to be around other people, spaces for people to do all the kinds of activities that people like to do, that they enjoy doing collectively and that benefit society and encourage people to interact, regardless of their social or economic circumstance, or places for people to reflect, parks, places for people to sit and relax. And there are lots of ways we can do that, ways in which we can address and look at how we break down those barriers. We can do it with architectural language. We can look at the ways that spaces are formulated to break down divisions and barriers between inside and outside, between green and hard surfaces and try and generate spaces that really encourage interaction, encourage people to do things together and encourage a sense of community. We need to mandate government, we need to provide examples to developers, to people to generate that the benefit of these may not be measured in a financial return on investment, but the social benefit to us all is really immeasurable in the long run."", '19:20': ""And if we do that, I think we can demonstrate -- and we've demonstrated in the past that designers had the capacity to do that -- I think if we can do that, we can demonstrate to people that society is an inclusive community, and that if everybody is included, and if everybody feels part of the society, then we have a much better chance of ensuring a sustainable future."", '19:40': 'Thank you.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.ted.com/talks/ofer_levy_the_new_science_of_personalized_vaccines,The new science of personalized vaccines,"At the intersection of precision medicine and vaccinology lies a revolutionary scientific pursuit: personalized vaccines. Infectious disease specialist Ofer Levy introduces this promising medical approach, in which tailored inoculations will enable effective immunization of the most vulnerable among us, including the young and elderly, and shares how we're now venturing into a new era of sustaining and supporting human life. (This talk contains graphic medical imagery.)",0:11:36,11.6,181141,2020-06-18T14:58:11+00:00,"['medicine', 'science', 'public health', 'Vaccines', 'medical research', 'disease', 'TEDx']","['English', 'Español', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ', '中文 (繁體)']",Ofer Levy,Physician and scientist,"{'00:10': ""It is hard to overstate the beneficial effects of immunization. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, US children born over the last 20 years -- for those children, vaccines will prevent greater than 322 million illnesses, greater than 21 million hospitalizations and greater than 730,000 deaths, with the societal cost savings of nearly 1.4 trillion dollars. Those are big numbers. But let's zoom in and look at a particular example."", '00:45': ""Vaccines have nearly eliminated a bacterial infection called Haemophilus influenzae. This bacterium used to infect young infants causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, meningitis, death or permanent disability. As a young pediatrician, I saw a few cases. You folks probably have never heard of this disease, because vaccines have been so effective. You could see in the graph on the right that since the introduction of vaccines, the incidence of Haemophilus bacterial infections has plummeted like a rock, and it's nearly vanished. So vaccines are generally a success story. But we also face challenges."", '01:26': ""For one, for most vaccines, we need to give multiple doses to achieve or maintain protection. The scientific community is working on developing single-shot vaccines. Imagine being able to get only one influenza shot your whole life and not having to get a seasonal flu vaccine. Certain microbes are difficult to immunize against. A classic example is human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The need is urgent, progress is being made; we're not there yet. Another critical element in vaccine research right now is optimizing vaccines for the most vulnerable among us, the very young and the elderly. And this is an active area of research."", '02:11': ""Finally, one of the biggest challenges we unfortunately face right now are anti-vax attitudes. In fact, it's alarming that over 100,000 infants and children in the United States have not received any vaccines, and that number is growing. In fact, the World Health Organization, or WHO, has declared anti-vax attitudes as one of the 10 most important threats to human health in the world today. This graphic illustrates the spread of anti-vax sentiment in the state of California, from the year 2000 to 2013, by looking at the percentage of public kindergarten students who claim the personal exemption against immunization."", '02:57': ""Anti-vax sentiment is on the rise, and it has very real consequences. Many of you may be aware of the fact that we're seeing infections that we thought we conquered long ago coming back. Measles outbreaks have been reported in multiple US states. And many have forgotten, but measles is very infectious and dangerous. Just a few viral particles can infect an individual. And there have been even reports at sporting events and at an Olympic stadium where the virus, through the air, travels long distances and infects a vulnerable person in the crowd. In fact, if I had a measles cough right now,"", '03:34': '(Coughs)', '03:36': 'somebody in the back of this auditorium could get infected. And this has had very real-world consequences. Just a few months ago, an airline stewardess contracted measles on a flight, the virus entered her brain and caused encephalitis, and she died. So people are now dying due to this anti-vax sentiment.', '03:58': ""I do want to take a few minutes to address those who don't believe in vaccines and who resist vaccines. As a pediatrician who receives my yearly flu vaccination, as a parent of three children who have been vaccinated according to the recommended schedule, and as a pediatric infectious disease consultant who has taken care of young children with meningitis that would have been preventable had their parents accepted immunization, this is a personal matter to me. Let's take a look at who is going to pay the price if we start dialing back the amount of vaccination in our society. This graph depicts, on the Y axis, the number of individuals dying of infection in the world. And on the X axis, the age of the individuals who are dying. And as you can see, it's very much a U-shaped distribution, and it's particularly stark in the very young ages. So vaccines shield the very young from infection. And if we want to talk, my friends, about what vaccines cause, because there's a lot of speculation, unfounded speculation on the internet, of what vaccines cause, vaccines cause adults, OK? That's what they cause. And the other thing that they cause is for elderly individuals to live longer. Because they are shielded against influenza and other killers of the elderly."", '05:21': ""Now, let's talk a little bit about how we can improve vaccines even further. We can create vaccines that can immunize the most vulnerable among us and perhaps even vaccines that protect with single shots. Let me go over a little bit of the immunology. In the top panel, what you see is a simple vaccine. All vaccines contain something called an antigen. The antigen is like a piece of a germ, of a microbe, that your body remembers, right? It forms antibodies and those antibodies can protect you. So those kind of vaccines can induce an immune response, but as you see here, that immune response tends to go up and back down, and you need to get another dose and another dose to maintain protection. What can we do?"", '06:05': 'We and other scientists around the world are finding molecules that can boost a vaccine response. Those are called adjuvants, from the Latin ""adjuvare,"" to help or aid. Adjuvants are molecules we might add to a vaccine to get a stronger response. And in the presence of the adjuvant, depicted here in red, you have a much more profound activation of the white blood cells of your immune system, and generate a much more profound immune response, with much higher antibody levels, more rapidly, and that lasts a long time for durable immunity. Interestingly, these adjuvants have different effects depending on the age or other demographic factors of the individual. Which brings me to the notion of precision vaccines.', '06:48': ""This is the idea that we will take precision medicine -- you know what precision medicine is, right, that's the idea that populations may vary in their response to a particular medicine -- and apply that to vaccines. Right? And here in Boston Children's Hospital at the Precision Vaccines Program I direct, we have five approaches, stepwise approaches we take, to build precision vaccines that are tailored to vulnerable populations."", '07:16': ""Number one, we need to understand what the attitude of a given population is towards a vaccine. You could build the most sophisticated vaccine in the world, but if nobody wants to take it, you're going nowhere. Number two, we have to think of the route of immunization. Most vaccines are intramuscular, or IM, but there are others, intranasal, oral and others. Then, as I just described to you, vaccines have components. All vaccines have an antigen, that's the part of the microbe that your body remembers, that you might make antibodies or cell-mediated immunity against. And we might add an adjuvant, as we talked about, to boost an immune response. But guess what? There are many different antigens to choose from and many different adjuvants. How are we going to make that decision? And the menu of these keeps growing."", '08:02': 'So on our team, we\'ve developed ways to test vaccines outside the body -- in Latin, that\'s ""in vitro"" -- in a tissue culture dish. So we use tissue engineering with blood cells to immunize outside the body and study the effect of the vaccine against, for example, infants or elderly individuals or others. And if you think about it, this is critical, because if you look at all the infections we want to build vaccines against, like Zika virus and Ebola virus and HIV and others, all the candidate antigens, all the candidate adjuvants, all the different populations, it\'s going to be impossible to do large, phase III clinical trials for every combination. This is where we think being able to test vaccines outside the body can make a big difference to accelerate vaccine development.', '08:52': ""And finally, this whole effort is to drive an immune response that will protect against that particular pathogen, getting antibodies and other cells to defend the body. We are also using additional innovative approaches to bring the most cutting-edge science to vaccine development. We're taking a deeper dive as to how current vaccines protect. We've formed an international consortium to study how hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns from hepatitis B infection. And to do this, we've developed a technique called small sample, big data. We can get a tiny little drop of baby blood before immunization, and take a tiny little drop after immunization, and we can measure the inventory of all the cells, and all the genes and all the molecules in that drop of blood, and we can compare after the vaccine to before the vaccine in that same baby and understand in a deep way exactly how that successful vaccine protects. And those lessons we can use to build the next vaccines in the future. So this diagram is really illustrating a tiny drop of blood yielding huge amounts of information, tens of thousands of analytes, and that hairball is meant to depict the gene pathways that are turned on and the molecular pathways that are turned on. So much more to come on that, and very exciting science."", '10:12': ""So we are partnering with scientists around the world to bring all these new technologies to invigorate vaccine development in a Precision Vaccines network. We are going to advance personalized vaccines for vulnerable populations around the world. Our team includes scientists, technical experts and physicians. And we're developing vaccines against infectious diseases like pertussis, which is whooping cough. We have a whooping cough vaccine, but it requires multiple doses, and the immunity keeps dropping. We want to develop a single-shot pertussis vaccine. We're working on a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, the number one cause of infant hospitalization in the United States. A better vaccine against influenza, and, of course, HIV. We're also looking at vaccines against cancer, allergy and, interestingly, opioid overdose."", '11:05': ""So, this is my final message to you. Vaccines protect you and your loved ones and the people around you. Not only do they protect you against infection, they prevent you from spreading it to others. Get immunized. Scientific progress is fragile and can be lost. We must foster accurate and respectful public dialogue. And finally, we're on the verge of great things, a new era of vaccination. We've just scratched the surface of what can be accomplished. Please advocate for this research."", '11:36': 'Thank you.', '11:37': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's an emotional decision, but weighing three factors can make it easier, says author and economist Emily Oster.",0:05:11,5.183333333,178845,2020-02-10T13:43:04+00:00,"['work-life balance', 'work', 'parenting', 'family', 'children']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro', 'Српски, Srpski', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'کوردی', 'ภาษาไทย', '中文 (简体)', '日本語']",Emily Oster,Economist,"{'00:01': ""When I was pregnant, I just got very frustrated. Don't eat deli meats, do this particular prenatal test. Why did you make that choice? Why didn't you make a different choice? I felt like I was being told to do things, and I never got the answer to why."", '00:14': '[The Way We Work]', '00:18': ""Sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can't seem to win. If I go back to work, I spend less time with my kid. What if they don't get the attention they need to adequately develop? If I stay home and give up my income stream, will I look back and regret my decision? There's a lot of conflicting advice out there about whether to stay home or go back to work, so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and emotional. You love your kids and want what's best for them, but how do you determine what best means when everyone has a different opinion?"", '00:46': ""There are many variations of parents that a household can have, and I think more families should be asking the question of whether it makes sense for the male partner to stay home. But the truth is that in the current time, most of the discussions about stay-at-home parents focus on women in particular. And it's usually the women who say they feel that what they do during the day is going to determine at a deep level what kind of mom and person they are. That is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent. And when you're met with the side-eye after telling someone you're going back to work or not, it can poke holes in your confidence."", '01:18': ""I decided to dig in and find out. Is it better to stay at home or go back to work? It's an emotional decision, yes, but as an economist I've learned that we can use data to help navigate through those emotional decisions and feel confident we're making the best decision for our family. Specifically there are three main factors you should consider before you decide."", '01:35': ""First, you need to think about how this decision will affect your family budget. Let's do some numbers. Say your total household income is 100,000 dollars, with you and your partner making 50,000 each. That means you bring home about 85,000 dollars after taxes. If both of you work and the family pays 1,500 dollars a month for childcare, your total disposable income would be 67,000 dollars a year."", '01:58': ""Are you with me so far? If you decide to stay home, your family makes less but you don't pay for childcare. Your disposable income goes down in this scenario, but not by as much as it would if you didn't factor in the childcare. It becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area. A full-time nanny can run 40, 50,000 dollars a year depending on where you live. If that's the case in your neighborhood, in the scenario I outlined, it would completely wipe out one parent's income, and you'd be better off financially with one parent staying home. Of course, this is only a short-term analysis. Childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school, and you may make a higher income later, so you want to factor that in if you can."", '02:37': ""Once you've done the math, you'll know what's possible and you'll be able to make a more informed choice, which should feel empowering."", '02:43': ""Second, it's time to talk about what's best for your child. You may think this should be the core of your decision, but there's actually no right answer. According to studies from Europe and the US, the decision to go back to work or stay at home won't actually make or break your child's future success. Research shows that two parents working full-time has a similar effect on your child's future test scores and income to one parent working and one not. What seems to be most important is the environment your child is in during their spare time. As long as they're engaging in enriching activities; reading, practicing their motor skills, interacting with other kids, they're going to thrive whether or not you're at home."", '03:22': 'There is a bit of nuance in the data. For example, studies have found, that if both parents work, kids from poorer families are impacted positively, and kids from richer families are impacted less positively. So depending on your household configuration, the effects on your child could be a little positive, or a little negative, but the overall impact is negligible.', '03:43': ""Now I want to call out an exception: maternity leave. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that babies do better when their mothers take some maternity leave. The early days with your child can impact their development, so if you have paid leave, you should take it, and if you don't, maybe consider taking some unpaid leave for those first few months, if your budget allows."", '04:03': 'And finally, ask yourself, what do I want? While this may seem simple, it\'s the factor that feels most taboo to explore. In talking to parents I find that when a woman chooses to stay home, she often feels obligated to say she made this choice for her children\'s optimal development. Which, sure, can be part of the reason, but a perfectly acceptable answer is, ""this is the lifestyle I prefer,"" or ""this is what works for my family."" The same goes for the working mother. Saying, ""I like my job, and that\'s why I went back to work,"" is enough. If you want to go back to work, that\'s great. You\'re lucky to have a job that you love and you have every right to keep it once you become a parent.', '04:40': ""Be honest with yourself about what you'd like to do. If you're upfront about that, you're guaranteed to feel happier, which will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be, and isn't that the whole point? There is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting. The best decision is the one that will make you -- and your family -- the happiest. Up to you to decide what's next. By acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not is just that, a choice, with factors pushing you in various directions, we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best for our families.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it reminds you that because light takes time to travel across space, even from just across the street or across the room, everything you\'re seeing in the present moment is technically an image of the past.', '06:03': 'Signs influence the way we all navigate the world, which means they have the ability to create a collective experience or understanding. My time in South Africa taught me that when people are able to find common ground and work together towards a mutual goal, powerful things can happen and so much more becomes possible. And I want to create more opportunities for people to find that kind of common ground. I want people to feel the power of collaboration, sometimes quite literally.', '06:39': 'A few years ago, a friend of mine showed me how our bodies can safely conduct small amounts of electricity. And if you hold hands with another person, a small electrical current can pass through your held hands and become like a switch that can trigger something else to happen. So last year, I used that form of human connection to activate an inflatable sculpture. I put two sensors on a platform far enough apart so that one person can\'t make it work on their own. But when two or more people work together to complete that electrical circuit, the inflatable comes to life. And it begins to fill with air, and the longer people hold hands, the larger it becomes, expanding into the words ""You are magic.""', '07:30': '(Music, birds chirping)', '07:34': 'I always love to see how each group of people finds a different way to bridge that physical and metaphorical divide. But as soon as they release their hands and break that connection, the words immediately begin to slouch and fall over and eventually return to a lifeless pile of fabric on the ground.', '07:59': '(Applause)', '08:07': ""At this moment in time, I think we could all agree that the future feels pretty bleak and uncertain. But maybe the hope for a brighter, more sustainable, more equitable future depends first on our ability to imagine it. But after we imagine it, we actually have to believe it's possible. And then we have to find common ground with people we would maybe otherwise disagree with and work together towards that mutual goal. And if we do that, I believe we have the capacity for magic."", '08:53': ""So if you can humor me for one more minute, I'm going to ask everyone in this theater to hold hands. When was the last time you held hands with a stranger?"", '09:09': '(Laughter)', '09:13': ""And if you feel comfortable, go ahead and make that metaphorical gesture of reaching across the aisle. And after you've held hands with people on either side of you, if you feel comfortable, please close your eyes. Now take a minute to imagine what you want, what you want the future to look like. And give yourself permission to be at least a little bit idealistic. What do you want to see change or happen in your own life as an individual? What do you want to see change or happen for everyone, for the planet? Can you picture it? And can you start to see how, if we all worked together, it might actually be possible? Now open your eyes, and let's make it real."", '10:13': 'Thank you.', '10:14': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to talk about how changing the way we perceive sharks and interact with them could change our environment, economies, and lives for the better. But first, I want to introduce you to someone who has positively influenced and inspired my life\'s work, passion, and focus. She\'s intelligent, she\'s graceful, beautiful, efficient, but what I admire her most for is her very important work and role. What most people don\'t know is that without her work and influence, none of our lives would be the same. And I wanted to describe her to you first, before I showed you her photo, because I\'ve come to find that, oftentimes, we make snap judgments, prejudice, based off of very little factual information. I\'ve personally found this because oftentimes I\'m judged solely off of my appearance or work as a professional model, rather than my primary work in science, conservation, and business. So, please keep in mind the truth that often there\'s more than meets the eye, and when you take time to get to know someone and better understand them, maybe you can better value them. And sometimes it\'s a little more interesting than you think too. So, without further ado, my beautiful role model, Bella, which means beautiful, and yes, she\'s a great white shark, or more accurately termed, a white shark, Carcharodon carcharias. Now, I know you might just be noticing her nice teeth and thinking something along the lines of ""monster,"" but tonight, put your prior beliefs about sharks on hold, while I explain why Bella is an ideal role model, why we should seriously take action to redefine the relationship we have with these animals, to one based on scientific fact, to that or reality, rather than appearances, snap judgments, and fictitious Hollywood movies. Bella and her kind are extremely intelligent. I\'ve observed her, and her kind, outsmarting even humans within a matter of moments by adapting her behavior even in novel situations. This ability to quickly adapt has likely led to sharks\' resilience over time. They evolved before dinosaurs, before trees. They evolved two more known sensory systems than we even have to aid them a high level of efficiency in their very important role in the ecosystems, shaping, influencing them, and making them stronger, and better. Now, even though they are highly cognitive, cautious, and take in multiple factors before they take action, it is true that on rare, rare, rare, much more rare, occasions than we make mistakes, sharks do make mistakes, and, unfortunately, someone does get bit. Still, considering the millions of people that enter the water, the oceans, every single day, and the average number of fatalities is five to seven ... Now, I feel extremely lucky. I get to spend almost every single day diving with sharks, over 30 different species around the world on a diversity of research programs and conservation campaigns. My work in marine biology focuses on ethology, which is animal behavior and psychology, and cognitive ecology, where I study the way the animals interact with one another and their environment. I\'ve come to observe and learn some of the most fascinating things I wish I had more time to share with you tonight. But in my limited time with you, what I\'ve come to appreciate, what I feel is most important and urgent, and if I could speak up for sharks, what I\'d want to share with you, is their very important role and work, and how it affects all of our lives. Essentially, imagine sharks as the ocean\'s immune system, the white blood cells. They pick up the dead, dying, weak, sick, injured animals, leaving only the healthiest to reproduce, keeping lower trophic levels and populations in balance. We all rely on our immune systems, and the scientific evidence for the importance of sharks is mounting. There are so many studies that show one after the other that the removal of sharks has environmental and economic negative impacts - Ransom A Myers, Bascompete - effects all the way down to coral reef systems. The removal of sharks has been attributed with starvation. Throughout the respected scientific community, there\'s no denying the importance of sharks, their effects on our environments, our economies, even the air that we breathe. 70-80% of the air we rely on to continue living comes from our oceans. Either directly or indirectly, we all rely on the oceans. Billions rely on it for seafood, over 200 million rely on it for direct employments. Our lives, our futures, are interconnected. In the words of one of my human role models, the wonderful Dr Sylvia Earle, ""With every drop of water that you drink, every breath that you take, you\'re connected to the sea. No matter where on the planet you live."" But sharks are still scary, right? So that\'s kind of the problem. Most peoples don\'t know many factual things about sharks, except they have teeth, and many more people don\'t know that sharks are actually being decimated, globally, at a rate of over 11,000 every single hour. That\'s more than three sharks every single second. That translates to 70-100 million sharks killed every year. That\'s like killing everyone in Spain, Austria and France every single year. Now, according to fishing records, over 90% of sharks have been depleted. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, over a third of all large sharks have been wiped out, or are facing extinction, or are vulnerable to extinction. So, why such a mass slaughter of such an important and keystone species? Well, some of it is due to silly things like souvenirs and pharmaceuticals. Some of it is due to men and their inferiority complexes ... I\'m guessing. (Laughter) (Applause) 80% of long-lining is bycatch, and most of it is sharks. Culling, which is probably this least intelligent reaction a country can have to an adverse shark-human interaction; basically, like shooting yourself in the foot, from a behavioral standpoint, also a waste and indiscriminate killer. But the number one killer of sharks, globally: a bowl of soup. Yes, we are trading the health and productivity of our oceans-reliant environment and economies for a bowl of soup. What\'s worse, it\'s not even nutritious; it\'s actually toxic. It\'s merely for the Chinese culture belief that when they serve that soup, it means that they\'re prestigious or important. But what is classy about catching a shark, hacking off its fins, oftentimes while it\'s still alive, wasting 95% of the animal just to make yourself feel better about your social status. Consider: sharks have been evolving for over 400 million years; humans, 200,000, and their culturals, far less. We can live without culture, but not without our oceans, and our oceans cannot live without their immune systems. Like rhinos killed just for their horns, and elephants killed just for their tusks, sharks are being killed, slaughtered, globally, just for their fins. Now, I love traveling the world and experiencing the diversity of cultures, but there has to be a point when we re-evaluate the relationship that we have with sharks and animals, and look at how our cultures can adapt and evolve honorably. An ancient Chinese proverb says when you do not change your direction, you may end up where you are heading. So what if we were to adopt this idea and change the way we interact with sharks? What would that look like? Well, the great news is we already have concrete examples, places like Palau, Bahamas, areas like Cabo Pulmo, and Palmyra. In those areas, reef and fish stocks are thriving. Ecotourism is bringing in over US $314 million to local economies, directly employing over 10,000 jobs. This study by Dr Michele Barnes and the University of British Columbia is actually showing that that number will increase, more than double, in less than 20 years. So $780 million, far outweighing the global fin trade. So put at the most basic terms, even on just the monetary level, which is usually what politicians care about, a live shark is worth more than a dead shark. And what\'s great is, these shark ecotourism programs, they can support research. I was working out with Dr Mauricio Hoyos, we were tagging, taking biopsies, and I was wondering: Is any of this conservation-based research going to make a difference before these guys are just wiped out off the planet? Then one day, 20 meters underwater, doing a population count surrounded by these beautiful sharks, I was realizing by the time I gather, process and publish my studies, another 3-6 million sharks will be killed. So why study something that\'s being eradicated the rate the sharks are and not do anything about it. So I opened my research to the public. I developed a program, where people could come to learn about sharks from a scientific perspective. I collaborated with @juansharks, who is a well-known shark and marine photographer and shark specialist. We developed this program that\'s research- and conservation-based, and opened it to the public so they could learn about their biology, physiology, behavior, how to interact with them safely, answers all those questions people don\'t know about sharks. The cool thing is people actually get to get in the water with us and see for themselves, eye to eye, what sharks are really like. It\'s such a successful program as people can speak up for sharks from a first-hand perspective and also influence their networks, and change people\'s minds. We are also able to fund educational outreach through this, reef and beach cleanups, local conservation campaigns, and international conservation campaigns, like stopping the cull in Western Australia, a story for another time I\'m honestly rather glad I don\'t have time to share tonight as I\'d end up crying. But we were able to save one of the juvenile sharks. She was under three meters, and she would have just died, even though she was cattle tagged improperly, and, you know, for 90 minutes, I swam with her, looking her in the eye, and trying to tell her it was going to be okay as blood was spilling out of her head, and kind of trying to tell myself it was going to be okay. After 90 minutes, she swam off: and it was that effort. This is another conservation campaign, a little better known. It reached over 2 million people in 2 days and featured none other than the lovely role model, Bella, who is so great for her species, a great representative. At the time when we released it, it was because there was a study put out showing there were less than 350 great whites, in the area from California to Alaska to Hawaii to Mexico, an area where juansharks and I grew up diving with sharks, with white sharks specifically. We knew many of them, had spent much time with them, studying behavior, working with them. So what do you do when you hear someone you love, care about, understand, is being eradicated? Something. So, we thought, with Water Inspired we\'d try and use inspiring photography and videography to inspire people to care. We needed people to give white sharks a second look, a second chance. They don\'t make the news very often. When they do, I\'m sure you guys all know, it\'s not usually good press. So we were successful. We wanted to show the natural beauty of sharks. But most often, when people see a beautiful image like this, they just think it\'s just on its way to eat the next person, right? So, we want to do the anti-Jaws. The little blond girl, she gets eaten in the fictitious movie, right? So what\'s it like in reality? Well, I\'ve been working with them for a long time, right? We dive to get receivers and other things like that, so I wanted to show a connection, I wanted people to be able to connect, see another side of these animals, realize that we can coexist. But in order to coexist, they have to exist, and there\'s so much more to these animals than meets the eye. When you take the time to get to know somebody, you know, you can understand that maybe there\'s more to them. And so I wanted to share that with the world. And I have to give the disclaimer - I mean, there\'s just so many things that I would love to share with you guys -- but I do have to give the disclaimer that they deserve a lot of respect ... not fear, but they are apex predators, they do have a role ... and we need them for that role, it\'s very important. I mean, I could cite study after study after study, showing the importance of that. You know, if I wanted to go out into the African savanna and pat a lion, you know what I would do? I would call up the lion whisperer, and I\'d go hang out with him, and I\'d learn, and I\'d study from him, out of respect for the animal because of its reputation. So, while I understand that, especially the way that they are portrayed in the media, that people are afraid of them, you shouldn\'t be afraid of them; you should just respect them. they are beautiful animals, there\'s so much more to them. So if there\'s one thing that Bella has taught me, it\'s that, like Bella, we can all positively change and influence our environments for the better. All we need to do is take action. In the words of Jane Goodall: Every day we make an impact. It\'s up to us what kind of an impact we want that to be. Now, this was just one successful collaborative program that we collaborated with GoPro on. They were very true to the message and released a beautiful piece, but there are so many other things, other media pieces we could do, even just writing to a restaurant, asking them not to serve shark fin soup. New campaigns, political policies, the ideas are endless. What it comes down to is: Yeah, knowledge is powerful, but it\'s nothing without action. I love Nike. I get up every morning and go running. It\'s like, just do it. You may not feel like it, but any effort is better than no effort. [We may feel like what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean, but the ocean would be less without that drop.] So I want to ask you guys tonight, (Laughter) to take action for your future. Sharks and the oceans affect us all. I\'d like to see a raise of hands for all those that are willing to take a small, small action for a better future. Raise your hands if you are willing to take that action. Oh, I so see all those hands. Okay, I\'m going to call you out on it. I want you guys to use that hand and grab your phones. I\'ll do it with you. Grab your phones. I know it\'s usually rude to grab your phones during a talk, but you\'ll be helping me. This is really good. This is good. This is your call to action. Let\'s do it! (Laughter) So I want you guys to grab your phone, and we\'re going to spread great ideas globally. I want you guys to Tweet, Facebook, Instagram, something. Spread an idea, share a fact about a shark. I\'m going to do it with you because it\'s actually really fun. Even though you guys are kind of dark - Okay, ready? Smile! Okay. So don\'t get distracted with the missed call or text. This\'ll only take a minute, and I\'m off the stage, so ... All right, let\'s do this together. We\'re going to make a difference, a measurable impact for sharks. So I\'m going to Instagram. This is how the world is now, right? We all just walk around on our phones. I think I saw that on a talk earlier. This is all good. Okay next. So I\'m going to use a hashtag. #HelpSaveSharks. Okay. #HelpSaveBella. Here with the amazing group at TEDx conference in Europe, helping spread great ideas and ways we can help save sharks and our future. Sharks are important. Redefining the relationships we have with sharks. #SharkConservation, #HelpSaveSharks, #NoSharkFinSoup, #TEDSavesSharks, #TEDTalksonSharks. Okay. And I will share that. Awesome! And this is the best part. I get to thank you all for being a part of the force that redefines the relationship we have with sharks for a better future. Thank you, guys.

Digital minister Audrey Tang shares how Taiwan avoided a COVID-19 shutdown in early 2020 through innovations like developing apps to map mask availability, crowdsourcing ideas that could become laws and creating a ""humor over rumor"" campaign to combat disinformation with comedy. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED science curator David Biello and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded June 1, 2020.)",0:48:57,48.95,177223,2020-06-22T14:54:06+00:00,"['government', 'technology', 'democracy', 'innovation', 'social change', 'society', 'coronavirus', 'development']","['English', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro']",Audrey Tang,Digital Minister of Taiwan,"{'00:05': 'Audrey Tang: Very happy to be joining you, and good local time, everyone.', '00:10': 'David Biello: So, tell us about -- Sorry to -- Tell us about digital tools and COVID.', '00:18': ""AT: Sure. Yeah, I'm really happy to share with you how Taiwan successfully countered the COVID using the power of digital democracy tools. As we know, democracy improves as more people participate. And digital technology remains one of the best ways to improve participation, as long as the focus is on finding common ground, that is to say, prosocial media instead of antisocial media. And there's three key ideas that I would like to share today about digital democracy that is fast, fair and fun."", '00:52': ""First about the fast part. Whereas many jurisdictions began countering coronavirus only this year, Taiwan started last year. Last December, when Dr. Li Wenliang, the PRC whistleblower, posted that there are new SARS cases, he got inquiries and eventually punishments from PRC police institutions. But at the same time, the Taiwan equivalent of Reddit, the Ptt board, has someone called nomorepipe reposting Dr. Li Wenliang's whistleblowing. And our medical officers immediately noticed this post and issued an order that says all passengers flying in from Wuhan to Taiwan need to start health inspections the very next day, which is the first day of January."", '01:32': ""And this says to me two things. First, the civil society trusts the government enough to talk about possible new SARS outbreaks in the public forum. And the government trusts citizens enough to take it seriously and treat it as if SARS has happened again, something we've always been preparing for, since 2003. And because of this open civil society, according to the CIVICUS Monitor after the Sunflower Occupy, Taiwan is now the most open society in the whole of Asia. We enjoy the same freedom of speech, of assembly, [unclear] as other liberal democracies, but with the emphasis on keeping an open mind to novel ideas from the society. And that is why our schools and businesses still remain open today, there was no lockdown, it's been a month with no local confirmed cases."", '02:16': ""So the fast part. Every day, our Central Epidemic Command Center, or CECC, holds a press conference, which is always livestreamed, and we work with the journalists, they answer all the questions from the journalists, and whenever there's a new idea coming in from the social sector, anyone can pick up their phone and call 1922 and tell that idea to the CECC."", '02:34': ""For example, there was one day in April where a young boy has said he doesn't want to go to school because his school mates may laugh at him because all he had is a pink medical mask. The very next day, everybody in the CECC press conference started wearing pink medical masks, making sure that everybody learns about gender mainstreaming. And so this kind of rapid response system builds trust between the government and the civil society."", '02:58': ""And the second focus is fairness. Making sure everybody can use their national health insurance card to collect masks from nearby pharmacies, not only do we publish the stock level of masks of all pharmacies, 6,000 of them, we publish it every 30 seconds. That's why our civic hackers, our civil engineers in the digital space, built more than 100 tools that enable people to view a map, or people with blindness who talk to chat bots, voice assistants, all of them can get the same inclusive access to information about which pharmacies near them still have masks. And because the national health insurance single payer is more than 99.9 percent of health coverage, people who show any symptoms will then be able to take the medical mask, go to a local clinic, knowing fully that they will get treated fairly without incurring any financial burden. And so people designed a dashboard that lets everybody see our supply is indeed growing, and whether there's over- or undersupply, so that we codesign this distribution system with the pharmacies, with the whole of society."", '03:57': ""So based on this analysis, we show that there was a peak at 70 percent, and that remaining 20 percent of people were often young, work very long hours, when they go off work, the pharmacies also went off work, and so we work with convenience stores so that everybody can collect their mask anytime, 24 hours a day. So we ensure fairness of all kinds, based on the digital democracy's feedback."", '04:21': 'And finally, I would like to acknowledge that this is a very stressful time. People feel anxious, outraged, there\'s a lot of panic buying, a lot of conspiracy theories in all economies. And in Taiwan, our counter-disinformation strategy is very simple. It\'s called ""humor over rumor."" So when there was a panic buying of tissue paper, for example, there was a rumor that says, ""Oh, we\'re ramping up mass production, it\'s the same material as tissue papers, and so we\'ll run out of tissue paper soon."" And our premier showed a very memetic picture that I simply have to share with you. In very large print, he shows his bottom, wiggling it a little bit, and then the large print says ""Each of us only have one pair of buttocks."" And of course, the serious table shows that tissue paper came from South American materials, and medical masks come from domestic materials, and there\'s no way that ramping up production of one will hurt the production of the other. And so that went absolutely viral. And because of that, the panic buying died down in a day or two. And finally, we found out the person who spread the rumor in the first place was the tissue paper reseller.', '05:30': 'And this is not just a single shock point in social media. Every single day, the daily press conference gets translated by the spokesdog of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, that translated a lot of things. For example, our physical distancing is phrased as saying ""If you are outdoors, you need to keep two dog-lengths away, if you are indoor, three dog-lengths away,"" and so on. And hand sanitation rules, and so on. So because all this goes viral, we make sure that the factual humor spreads faster than rumor. And they serve as a vaccine, as inoculation, so that when people see the conspiracy theories, the R0 value of that will be below one, meaning that those ideas will not spread.', '06:08': ""And so I only have this five-minute briefing, the rest of it will be driven by your Q and A, but please feel free to read more about Taiwan's counter-coronavirus strategy, at taiwancanhelp.us. Thank you."", '06:23': 'DB: That\'s incredible. And I love this ""humor versus rumor."" The problem here in the US, perhaps, is that the rumors seem to travel faster than any response, whether humorous or not. How do you defeat that aspect in Taiwan?', '06:44': ""AT: Yeah, we found that, of course, humor implicitly means there is a sublimation of upsetness, of outrage. And so as you see, for example, in our premier's example, he makes fun of himself. He doesn't make a joke at the expense of other people. And this was the key. Because people think it hilarious, they share it, but with no malicious or toxic intentions. People remember the actual payload, that table about materials used to produce masks, much more easily. If they make a joke that excludes parts of the society, of course, that part of society will feel outraged and we will end up creating more divisiveness, rather than prosocial behavior. So the humor at no expense, not excluding any part of society, I think that was the key."", '07:38': ""DB: It's also incredible because Taiwan has such close ties to the origin point of this."", '07:45': 'AT: PRC, yes.', '07:46': 'DB: The mainland. So given those close economic ties, how do you survive that kind of disruption?', '07:57': ""AT: Yeah, I mean, at this moment, it's been almost a month now with no local confirmed cases, so we're doing fine. And what we are doing, essentially, is just to respond faster than pretty much anyone. We started responding last year, whereas pretty much everybody else started responding this year. We tried to warn the world last year, but, anyway. So in any case, the point here is that if you start early enough, you get to make sure that the border control is the main point where you quarantine all the returning residents and so on, instead of waiting until the community spread stage, where even more human-right invading techniques would probably have to be deployed one way or the other."", '08:42': 'And so in Taiwan, we\'ve not declared an emergency situation. We\'re firmly under the constitutional law. Because of that, every measure the administration is taking is also applicable in non-coronavirus times. And this forces us to innovate. Much as the idea of ""we are an open liberal democracy"" prevented us from doing takedowns. And therefore, we have to innovate of humor versus rumor, because the easy path, the takedown of online speech, is not accessible to us.', '09:10': 'Our design criteria, which is no lockdowns, also prevented us from doing any, you know, very invasive privacy encroaching response system. So we have to innovate at the border, and make sure that we have a sufficient number of, for example, quarantine hotels or the so-called ""digital fences,"" where your phone is basically connected to the nearby telecoms, and they make sure that if they go out of the 15-meter or so radius, an SMS is sent to the local household managers or police and so on. But because we focus all these measures at the border, the vast majority of people live a normal life.', '09:49': ""DB: Let's talk about that a little bit. So walk me through the digital tools and how they were applied to COVID."", '09:57': 'AT: Yes. So there\'s three parts that I just outlined. The first one is the collective intelligence system. Through online spaces that we design to be devoid of Reply buttons, because we see that, when there\'s Reply buttons, people focus on each other\'s face part, not the book part, and without ""Reply"" buttons, you can get collective intelligence working out their rough consensus of where the direction is going with the response strategies. So we use a lot of new technologies, such as Polis, which is essentially a forum that lets you upvote and downvote each other\'s feelings, but with real-time clustering, so that if you go to cohack.tw, you see six such conversations, talking about how to protect the most vulnerable people, how to make a smooth transition, how to make a fair distribution of supplies and so on.', '10:52': ""And people are free to voice their ideas, and upvote and downvote each other's ideas. But the trick is that we show people the main divisive points, and the main consensual points, and we respond only to the ideas that can convince all the different opinion groups. So people are encouraged to post more eclectic, more nuanced ideas and they discover, at the end of this consultation, that everybody, actually, agrees with most things, with most of their neighbors on most of the issues. And that is what we call the social mandate, or the democratic mandate, that then informs our development of the counter-coronavirus strategy and helping the world with such tools."", '11:30': ""And so this is the first part, it's called listening at scale for rough consensus. The second part I already covered is the distribute ledger, where everybody can go to a nearby pharmacy, present their NHI card, buy nine masks, or 10 if you're a child, and see the stock level of that pharmacy on their phone actually decreasing by nine or 10 in a couple of minutes. And if they grow by nine or 10, of course, you call the 1922, and report something fishy is going on. But this is participatory accountability. This is published every 30 seconds. So everybody holds each other accountable, and that massively increases trust."", '12:05': ""And finally, the third one, the humor versus rumor, I think the important thing to see here is that wherever there's a trending disinformation or conspiracy theory, you respond to it with a humorous package within two hours. We have discovered, if we respond within two hours, then more people see the vaccination than the conspiracy theory. But if you respond four hours or a day afterwards, then that's a lost cause. You can't really counter that using humor anymore, you have to invite the person who spread those messages into cocreation workshops. But we're OK with that, too."", '12:42': 'DB: Your speed is incredible. I see Whitney has joined us with some questions.', '12:47': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That\'s right, we have a few coming in already from the audience. Hi there, Audrey. And we\'ll start with one from our community member Michael Backes. He asks how long has humor versus rumor been a strategy that you\'ve implemented. Excuse me. ""How long has humor versus rumor strategy been implemented? Were comedians consulted to make the humor?""', '13:10': 'AT: Yes, definitely. Comedians are our most cherished colleagues. And each and every ministry has a team of what we call participation officers in charge of engaging with trending topics. And it\'s a more than 100 people-strong team now. We meet every month and also every couple of weeks on specific topics. It\'s been like that since late 2016, but it\'s not until our previous spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka, joined about a year and a half ago, do the professional comedians get to the team. Previously, this was more about inviting the people who post, you know, quotes like ""Our tax filing system is explosively hostile,"" and gets trending, and previously, the POs just invited those people. Everybody who complains about the finance minister\'s tax-filing experience gets invited to the cocreation of that tax filing experience. So previously, it was that. But Kolas Yotaka and the premier Su Tseng-chang said, wouldn\'t it be much better and reach more people if we add some dogs to it or cat\'s pictures to it? And that\'s been around for a year and a half.', '14:21': 'WPR: Definitely, I think it makes a lot of difference, just even seeing them without being part of the thought process behind that. And we have another question here from G. Ryan Ansin. He asks, ""What would you rank the level of trust your community had before the pandemic, in order for the government to have a chance at properly controlling this crisis?""', '14:43': ""AT: I would say that a community trusts each other. And that is the main point of digital democracy. This is not about people trusting the government more. This is about the government trusting the citizens more, making the state transparent to the citizen, not the citizen transparent to the state, which would be some other regime. So making the state transparent to the citizens doesn't always elicit more trust, because you may see something wrong, something missing, something exclusively hostile to its user experience, an so on, of the state. So it doesn't necessarily lead to more trust from the government. Sorry, from the citizen to the government. But it always leads to more trust between the social sector stakeholders."", '15:22': ""So I would say the level of trust between the people who are working on, for example, medical officers, and people who are working with the pandemic responses, people who manufacture medical masks, and so on, all these people, the trust level between them is very high. And not necessarily they trust the government. But we don't need that for a successful response. If you ask a random person on the street, they will say Taiwan is performing so well because of the people. When the CECC tells us to wear the mask, we wear the mask. When the CECC tells us not to wear a mask, like, if you are keeping physical distance, we wear a mask anyway. And so because of that, I think it's the social sector's trust between those different stakeholders that's the key to the response."", '16:10': ""WPR: I will come back shortly with more questions, but I'll leave you guys to continue your conversation."", '16:15': 'AT: Awesome.', '16:17': 'DB: Well, clearly, part of that trust in government was maybe not there in 2014 during the Sunflower Movement. So talk to me about that and how that led to this, kind of, digital transformation.', '16:36': ""AT: Indeed. Before March 2014, if you asked a random person on the street in Taiwan, like, whether it's possible for a minister -- that's me -- to have their office in a park, literally a park, anyone can walk in and talk to me for 40 minutes at a time, I'm currently in that park, the Social Innovation Lab, they would say that this is crazy, right? No public officials work like that. But that was because on March 18, 2014, hundreds of young activists, most of them college students, occupied the legislature to express their profound opposition to a trade pact with Beijing under consideration, and the secretive manner in which it was pushed through the parliament by Kuomintang, the ruling party at the time. And so the protesters demanded, very simply, that the pact be scraped, and the government to institute a more transparent ratification process. And that drew widespread public support."", '17:31': 'It ended a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised and agreed on the four demands [unclear] of legislative oversight. A poll released after the occupation showed that more than 75 percent remained dissatisfied with the ruling government, illustrating the crisis of trust that was caused by a trade deal dispute. And to heal this rift and communicate better with everyday citizens, the administration reached out to the people who supported the occupiers, for example, the g0v community, which has been seeking to improve government transparency through the creation of open-source tools. And so, Jaclyn Tsai, a government minister at the time, attended our hackathon and proposed the establishment of novel platforms with the online community to exchange policy ideas.', '18:19': 'And an experiment was born called vTaiwan, that pioneerly used tools such as Polis, that allows for ""agree"" or ""disagree"" with no Reply button, that gets people\'s rough consensus on issues such as crowdfunding, equity-based crowdfunding, to be precise, teleworking and many other cyber-related legislation, of which there is no existing unions or associations. And it proved to be very successful. They solved the Uber problem, for example, and by now, you can call an Uber -- I just called an Uber this week -- but in any case, they are operating as taxis. They set up a local taxi company called Q Taxi, and that was because on the platform, people cared about insurance, they care about registration, they care about all the sort of, protection of the passengers, and so on. So we changed the taxi regulations, and now Uber is just another taxi company along with the other co-ops.', '19:16': ""DB: So you're actually, in a way, crowdsourcing laws that, well, then become laws."", '19:23': ""AT: Yeah, learn more at crowd.law. It's a real website."", '19:29': ""DB: So, some might say that this seems easier, because Taiwan is an island, that maybe helps you control COVID, helps promote social cohesion, maybe it's a smaller country than some. Do you think that this could be scaled beyond Taiwan?"", '19:50': 'AT: Well, first of all, 23 million people is still quite some people. It\'s not a city, as some usually say, you know, ""Taiwan is a city-state."" Well, 23 million people, not quite a city-state. And what I\'m trying to get at, is that the high population density and a variety of cultures -- we have more than 20 national languages -- doesn\'t necessarily lead to social cohesion, as you said. Rather, I think, this is the humbleness of all the ministers in the counter-coronavirus response. They all took on an attitude of ""So we learned about SARS"" -- many of them were in charge of the SARS back then, but that was classical epidemiology. This is SARS 2.0, it has different characteristics. And the tools that we use are very different, because of the digital transformation. And so we are in it to learn together with the citizens.', '20:47': 'Our vice president at the time, Dr. Chen Chien-jen, an academician, literally wrote the textbook on epidemiology. However, he still says, ""You know, what I\'m going to do is record an online MOOC, a crash course on epidemiology, that shares with, I think, more than 20,00 people enrolled the first day, I was among them, to learn about important ideas, like the R0 and the basic transmission and how the various different measures work, and then they asked people to innovate. If you think of a new way that the vice president did not think of, just call 1922, and your idea will become the next day\'s press conference.', '21:28': ""And this is this colearning strategy, I think, that more than anything enabled the social cohesion, as you speak. But this is more of a robust civil society than the uniformity. There's no uniformity at all in Taiwan, everybody is entitled to their ideas, and all the social innovations, ranging from using a traditional rice cooker to revitalize, to disinfect the mask, to pink medical mask, and so on, there's all variety of very interesting ideas that get amplified by the daily press conference."", '22:00': ""DB: That's beautiful. Now -- oh, Whitney is back, so I will let her ask the next question."", '22:08': 'WPR: Sure, we\'re having some more questions come in. One from our community member Aria Bendix. Aria asked, ""How do you ensure that digital campaigns act quickly without sacrificing accuracy? In the US, there was a fear of inciting panic about COVID-19 in early January.""', '22:27': 'AT: This is a great question. So most of the scientific ideas about the COVID are evolving, right? The efficacy of masks, for example, is a very good example, because the different characteristics of previous respiratory diseases respond differently to the facial mask. And so, our digital campaigns focus on the idea of getting the rough consensus through. So basically, it\'s a reflection of the society, through Polis, through Slido, through the joint platform, the various tools that vTaiwan has prototyped, we know that people are feeling a rough consensus about things and we\'re responding to the society, saying, ""This is what you all feel and this is what we\'re doing to respond to your feelings.', '23:14': 'And the scientific consensus is still developing, but we know, for example, people feel that wearing a mask mostly protects you, because it reminds you to not touch your face and wash your hands properly."" And these, regardless of everything else, are the two things that everybody agrees with. So we just capitalize on that and say, ""OK, wash your hands properly, and don\'t touch your face, and wearing a mask reminds you of that."" And that lets us cut through the kind of, very ideologically charged debates and focus on what people generally resonate with one another. And that\'s how we act quickly without sacrificing scientific accuracy.', '23:53': 'WPR: And this next question sort of feels connected to this as well. It\'s a question from an anonymous community member. ""Pragmatically, do you think any of your policies could be applied in the United States under the current Trump administration?""', '24:06': 'AT: Quite a few, actually. We work with many states in the US and abroad on what we call ""epicenter to epicenter diplomacy."" (Laughs) So what we\'re doing essentially is, for example, there was a chat bot in Taiwan that lets you, but especially people under home quarantine, to ask the chat bot anything. And if there is a scientific adviser who already wrote a frequently asked question, the chat bot just responds with that, but otherwise, they will call the science advisory board and write an accessible response to that, and the spokesdog would translate that into a cute dog meme.', '24:45': ""And so this feedback cycle of people very easily accessing, finding, and asking a scientist, and an open API that allows for voice assistance and other third-party developers to get through it, resonates with many US states, and I think many of them are implementing it. And before the World Health Assembly, I think three days before, we held a 14 countries [unclear] lateral meeting, kind of, pre-WHA, where we shared many small, like, quick wins like this. And I think many jurisdictions took some of that, including the humor versus rumor. Many of them said that they're going to recruit comedians now."", '25:25': 'WPR: (Laughs) I love that.', '25:27': 'DB: I hope so.', '25:29': 'WPR: I hope so too. And we have one more question, which is actually a follow-up, from Michael Backes, who asked a question earlier. ""Does the Ministry plan to publish their plans in a white paper?"" Sounds like you\'re already sharing your plans with folks, but do you have a plan to put it out on paper?', '25:44': 'AT: Of course. Yeah, and multiple white papers. So if you go to taiwancanhelp.us, that is where most of our strategy is, and that website is actually crowdsourced as well, and it shows that more than five million now, I think, medical masks donated to the humanitarian aid. It\'s also crowdsourced. People who have some masks in their homes, who did not collect the rationed masks, they can use an app, say, ""I want to dedicate this to international humanitarian aid,"" and half of them choose to publish their names, so you can also see the names of people who participated in this. And there\'s also an ""Ask Taiwan Anything"" website,', '26:26': '(Laughs)', '26:28': 'at fightcovid.edu.tw, that outlines, in white paper form, all the response strategies, so check those out.', '26:37': 'WPR: Great. Well, I will disappear and be back later with some other questions.', '26:43': ""DB: A blizzard of white papers, if you will. I'd like to turn the focus on you a little bit. How does a conservative anarchist become a digital minister?"", '26:57': 'AT: Yeah, by occupying the parliament, and through that.', '27:01': '(Laughs)', '27:02': ""More interestingly, I would say that I go working with the government, but never for the government. And I work with the people, not for the people. I'm like this Lagrange point between the people's movements on one side and the government on the other side. Sometimes right in the middle, trying to do some coach or translation work. Sometimes in a kind of triangle point, trying to supply both sides with tools for prosocial communication. But always with this idea of getting the shared values out of different positions, out of varied positions. Because all too often, democracy is built as a showdown between opposing values."", '27:45': ""But in the pandemic, in the infodemic, in climate change, in many of those structural issues, the virus or carbon dioxide doesn't sit down and negotiate with you. It's a structural issue that requires common values built out of different positions. And so that is why my working principle is radical transparency. Every conversation, including this one, is on the record, including the internal meetings that I hold. So you can see all the different meeting transcripts in my YouTube channel, in the SayIt platform, where people can see, after I became digital minister, I held 1,300 meetings with more than 5,000 speakers, with more than 260,000 utterances. And every one of them has a URL that becomes a social object that people can have a conversation on."", '28:35': ""And because of that, for example, when Uber's David Plouffe visited me to lobby for Uber, because of radical transparency, he is very much aware of that, and so he made all the arguments based on public good, based on sustainability, and things like that, because he knows that the other sides would see his positions very clearly and transparently. So that encourages people to add on each other's argument, instead of attacking each other's person, you know, credits and things like that. And so I think that, more than anything, is the main principle of conserving the anarchism of the internet, which is about, you know, nobody can force anyone to hook to the internet, or to adhere to a new internet protocol. Everything has to be done using rough consensus and running code."", '29:23': 'DB: I wish you had more counterparts all around the world. Maybe you wish you had more counterparts all around the world.', '29:29': ""AT: That's why these ideas are worth spreading."", '29:32': ""DB: There you go. So one of the challenges that might arise with some of these digital tools is access. How do you approach that part of it for folks maybe who don't have the best broadband connection or the latest mobile phone or whatever it might be that's required?"", '29:54': ""AT: Well, anywhere in Taiwan, even on the top of Taiwan, almost 4,000 meters high, the Saviah, or the Jade Mountain, you're guaranteed to have 10 megabits per second over 4G or fiber or cable, with just 16 US dollars a month, an unlimited plan. And actually, on the top of the mountain, it's faster, fewer people use that bandwidth. And if you don't, it's my fault. It's personally my fault. In Taiwan, we have broadband as a human right. And so when we're deploying 5G, we're looking at places where the 4G has the weakest signal, and we begin with those places in our 5G deployment. And only by deploying broadband as a human right can we say that this is for everybody. That digital democracy actually strengthens democracy. Otherwise, we would be excluding parts of the society."", '30:44': 'And this also applies to, for example, you can go to a local digital opportunity center to rent a tablet that\'s guaranteed to be manufactured in the past three years, and things like that, to enable, also, the different digital access by the digital opportunity centers, universities and schools, and public libraries, very important. And if people who prefer to talk in their town hall, I personally go to that town hall with a 360 recorder, and livestream that to Taipei and to other municipalities, where the central government\'s public servants can join in a connected room style, but listening to the local people who set the agenda. So people still do face-to-face meetings, we\'re not doing this to replace face-to-face meetings. We\'re bringing more stakeholders from central government in the local town halls, and we\'re amplifying their voices by making sure the transcripts, the mind maps, and things like that are spread through the internet in real time, but we don\'t ever ask the elderly to, say, ""Oh, you have to learn typing, otherwise you don\'t do democracy."" It\'s not our style. But that requires broadband. Because if you don\'t have broadband, but only a very limited bandwidth, you are forced to use text-based communication.', '31:53': ""DB: That's right. Well, with access, of course, comes access for folks who maybe will misuse the platform. You talked a little bit about disinformation and using humor to beat rumor. But sometimes, disinformation is more weaponized. How do you combat those kinds of attacks, really?"", '32:14': 'AT: Right, so you mean malinformation, then. So essentially, information designed to cause intentional public harm. And that\'s no laughing matter. So for that, we have an idea called ""notice and public notice."" So this is a Reuters photo, and I will read the original caption. The original caption says ""A teenage extradition bill protester in Hong Kong is seen during a march to demand democracy and political reform in Hong Kong."" OK, a very neutral title by the Reuters. But there was a spreading of malinformation back last November, just leading to our presidential election, that shows something else entirely. This is the same photo -- that says ""This 13-year-old thug bought new iPhones, game consoles and brand-name sports shoes, and recruiting his brothers to murder police and collect 200,000 dollars."" And this, of course, is a weapon designed to sow discord, and to elicit in Taiwan\'s voters a kind of distaste for Hong Kong.', '33:20': 'And because they know that this is the main issue. And had we resorted to takedowns, that will not work, because that would only evoke more outrage. So we didn\'t do a takedown. Instead, we worked with the fact checkers and professional journalists to attribute this original message back to the first day that it was posted. And it came from Zhongyang Zhengfawei. That is the main political and legal unit of the central party, in the Central Communist Party, in CCP. And we know that it\'s their Weibo account that first did this new caption. So we sent out a public notice and with the partners in social media companies, pretty much all of them, they just put this very small",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To learn about the whole story.""""'", '34:17': 'And that, we found, that has worked, because people understand this is then not a news material. This is rather an appropriation of Reuters\' news material and a copyright infringement and I think that\'s part of the [unclear]. In any case, the point is that when people understand that this is an intentional narrative, they won\'t just randomly share it. They may share it," but with a comment that says """"This is what the Zhongyang Zhengfawei is trying to do to our democracy.""""'", '34:46': 'DB: Seems like some of the global social media companies could learn something from notice and public notice.'," '34:55': """"AT: Public notice"," that's right.""""", '34:56': 'DB: What advice would you have for the Twitters and Facebooks and LINEs and WhatsApps, and you name it, of the world?'," '35:08': """"AT: Yeah. So", just before our election, we said to all of them that we're not making a law to kind of punish them. However, we're sharing this very simple fact that there is this norm in Taiwan that we even have a separate branch of the government, the control branch, that published the campaign donation and expense. And it just so occurred to us that in the previous election, the mayoral one, there was a lot of candidates that did not include any social media advertisements in their expense to the Control Yuan. And so essentially, that means that there is a separate amount of political donation and expense that evades public scrutiny. And our Control Yuan published their numbers in raw data form, that is to say, they're not statistics, but individual records of who donated for what cause, when, where, and investigative journalists are very happy," because they can then make investigative reports about the connections between the candidates and the people who fund them.""""", '36:12': 'But they cannot work with the same material from the global social media companies. So I said," """"Look", this is very simple. This is the social norm here, I don\'t really care about other jurisdictions. You either adhere to the social norm that is set by the Control Yuan and the investigative journalists, or maybe you will face social sanctions. And this is not the government mandate, but it\'s the people fed up with, you know, black box, and that\'s part of the Sunflower Occupy\'s demands, also. And so Facebook actually published in the Ad Library, I think at that time, one of the fastest response strategies, where everybody who has basically any dark pattern advertisement will get revealed very quickly, and investigative journalists work with the local civic technologists to make sure that if anybody dare to use social media in such a divisive way, within an hour, there will be a report out condemning that. So nobody tried that during the previous presidential election season.', '37:14': 'DB: So change is possible.', '37:16': 'AT: Mhm.', '37:20': 'WPR: Hey there, we have some more questions from the community. There is an anonymous one that says," """"I believe Taiwan is outside WHO entirely and has a 130-part preparation program -- developed entirely on its own -- to what extent does it credit its preparation to building its own system?""""'"," '37:40': """"AT: Well", a little bit, I guess. We tried to warn the WHO, but at that point -- we are not totally outside, we have limited scientific access. But we do not have any ministerial access. And this is very different, right? If you only have limited scientific access, unless the other side's top epidemiologist happens to be the vice president, like in Taiwan's case, they don't always do the storytelling well enough to translate that into political action as our vice president did, right? So the lack of ministerial access, I think, is to the detriment of the global community, because otherwise, people could have responded as we did in the first day of January, instead of having to wait for weeks before the WHO declared that this is something, that there's definitely human to human transmission, that you should inspect people coming in from Wuhan, which they eventually did," but that's already two weeks or three weeks after what we did.""""", '38:44': 'WPR: Makes a lot of sense.'," '38:46': """"DB: More scientists and technologists in politics.

We just said a very simple thing in the CECC press conference, that there's going to be physical distancing. You maintain one and a half meters indoors or wear a mask. And that's it. And so there are some restaurants that put up, I guess, red curtains, some put very cute teddy bears and so on, on the chairs, to make sure that people spread evenly, some installed see-through glass or plastic walls between the seats. There's various social innovations happening around. And I think the only shops that got closed for a while, because they could not innovate quick enough to respond to these rules, was the intimate escort bars. But eventually, even they invented new ways, by handing out these caps that are plastic shielding," but still leaves room for drinking behind it. And so they opened with that social innovation."""""," '40:14': """"DB: That's amazing."""""," '40:16': """"WPR: It is", yeah, it's a lot to learn from your strategies there.

You've talked about that a little bit, but I'm sure the citizens of Taiwan are perhaps equally concerned about their privacy," especially given the geopolitical context.""""", '41:07': 'AT: Definitely.', '41:08': 'DB: So how do you cope with those demands?', '41:11': 'AT: Yeah, we design with not only defensive strategy, like minimization of data collection, but also proactive measures, such as privacy-enhancing technologies. One of the top teams that emerged out of our cohack, the TW response from the Polis, how to make contact tracing easier, focused not on the contact tracers, not on the medical officers, but on the person. So they basically said," """"OK", you have a phone, you can record your temperatures, you can record your whereabouts and things like that, but that is strictly in your phone. It doesn\'t even use Bluetooth. So there\'s no transmission. Technology uses open-source, you can check it, you can use it in airplane mode.

So basically, this is about designing with an aim to enhance other people's privacy, because personal data is never truly personal. It's always social, it's always intersectional. If I take a selfie at a party, I inadvertently also take pretty much everybody else's who are in the picture, the surroundings, the ambiance, and so on, and if I upload it to a cloud service, then I actually decimate the bargaining power, the negotiation power of everybody around me, because then their data is part of the cloud," and the cloud doesn't have to compensate them or get their agreement for it."""""," '43:04': """"And so only by designing the tools with privacy enhancing as a positive value", and not enhancing only the person's own privacy, just like a medical mask, it protects you, but mostly it also protects others, right?

You could float out in outer space, look down at the Earth and everything. It\'d be so neat!"" Only that\'s not how it is at all. If you are in outer space, you are orbiting the Earth: it\'s called free fall. You\'re actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment: that\'s the feeling you get if you\'re going over the top of a roller coaster, going, like, ""Whoa!"" Only you\'re doing this the whole time you\'re orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let\'s take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea, a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you in the backside or something. Let\'s zoom way back and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You\'re going to fall down and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you\'re going to miss. You\'re going to end up on the side of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling you back in sideways. So it\'s pulling you back in and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again, and now you\'re under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up, but you\'re moving sideways still. So you\'re going to miss the Earth again. Now you\'re on the other side of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth\'s pulling you sideways. So you\'re going to fall sideways, but you\'re going to be moving up and so you\'ll miss. Now you\'re back on top of the Earth again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You\'ll keep missing because you\'re moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They\'re always falling towards the Earth, but they\'re always missing, and therefore, they\'re falling all the time. They feel like they\'re falling, so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there\'s a big problem. First, you have to be going eight kilometers a second. That\'s 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you\'re going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth and come back where you came from, but there\'s a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does that make sense? Maybe not. OK, so think about that. Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story, and then you\'ll figure it out for yourselves.', '00:22': ""So the second thought I had was that I would tell the story of the history of music delivery, literally from the beginning, from pounding rocks to pounding rock. The good news about this is the first 10,000 years just sailed by. So for 10,000 years, if you want to make music, you literally pick up rocks, later instruments, those sorts of things. And this goes on for a very long time. Gradually in the West, mostly we start to get a performing class, people who were experts, who were really good at pounding rocks. So, by the 18th century, we're still basically doing this. We have a class of experts, professionals, who play very expensive instruments, for the most part, things like the organ, complicated instruments, and if you wanted to hear music in the 18th century, it was live. You had to go to a concert. You had to go to church, you had to go to a civic event, you had to go hear somebody making music live. So, music always involved social interaction. There were no headphones you could put on, there was no iPhone, there was no record player. If you wanted to hear music, you had to get out of the house. There's really, basically, no music in your house."", '01:34': ""This goes on through the 18th century from the beginning, and then we have ... our first disruption. These two things actually happened together, these two disruptions. We get the piano, right? The piano was a new technology that really starts to happen in the 18th century, and then it becomes something that you could mass-produce cheaply. So you can now have an instrument that's not too expensive, that everyone can have one, that you can have at home. So this allows for a kind of disruption, but it wouldn't have happened if the second disruption hadn't happened at the same time, which is that somebody figured out how to do cheap music printing."", '02:12': 'Remember Gutenberg and the other kind of printing? Music is a little more complicated. It took a little longer to figure out: How do I create a cheap way to distribute sheet music? In London, at the time of the American Revolution, there are 12 music shops. By 1800, there are 30. By 1820, there are 150. So the internet wasn\'t the first time this happened, because think about what happens when, all of a sudden, you go from ""If I want to hear music, I\'ve got to go hear Bach, I\'ve got to go hear Mozart."" That meant you had to actually go hear Mozart. You didn\'t buy a CD of Mozart, you didn\'t download Mozart. You couldn\'t even buy Mozart sheet music, at least not easily or cheaply. But if you wanted to hear Mozart or Bach, you had to go to Germany and go hear them.', '03:01': 'But that\'s not true for Beethoven. And Beethoven figures out that, in fact, there\'s a new market. Beethoven is an entrepreneur, not unlike our other friend, Bill Gates. He\'s an entrepreneur that figures out, ""Hey, I don\'t have to actually go to London. I can actually just sell sheet music. And it can be printed and mass-distributed, and I will be famous everywhere, and everybody else will play my music."" So that changes the experience of music for everybody. It changes the variety, it changes the global pyramid, it changes all sorts of things. It creates a new class of musicians, of composers and performers -- there\'s a division of labor. If you hire Bach to play for your wedding, guess who shows up? Bach!', '03:42': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""That's what he does for a living, right? He has no way to expand his business. But Beethoven does."", '03:49': ""Then this happens again. It happens 100 years later, so you're starting to see a theme. By the turn of the century, it's an interesting time for music delivery; 100 years later, we get the record player, the gramophone, the player piano. Now you could buy Rachmaninoff sheet music, but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff, you had to actually go to the concert hall. Not anymore. Now you can buy a record of Rachmaninoff, or you can buy a player piano and a roll that fits into another kind of recording device. And later, the radio."", '04:17': 'So think about this: you\'re a band in Texas; you\'re Doc Ross in Texas, and you\'ve got the Texas big band market, you\'ve got it nailed. And all of a sudden, there\'s this new thing called ""radio."" And now everybody can hear Count Basie and Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Man, the competition just sucks now. All of a sudden, the competition has gone global, just like it does a hundred years later, with the iPod, the internet and digital files and Garage Band, that do all of these things all over again.', '04:49': ""So now, maybe we can talk about these two guys. First of all, both of these guys are entrepreneurs. But second of all, both of these guys are software designers. That's what Beethoven does. He writes software that runs on that piece of hardware over there."", '05:06': '(Laughter)', '05:07': ""That's a piece of hardware. That's a device that you can use if you have my piece of paper. If you have sheet music, does it sound good? No, it's a piece of paper. It's like those floppy disks; they weren't very useful. You can use them as coasters, I guess. But they're not very useful on their own. So both Beethoven and Bill Gates are software designers."", '05:26': ""What's interesting is that they also both live at a time where the hardware is changing very quickly. Those of you who are old enough to remember, go back to the '90s, go back to Windows whatever, and remember your joy and your love of Bill Gates, as every time a new software package came out, you had to get a new computer. So, guess what? When Beethoven started writing music, he had this instrument up on top, with five octaves. This one's bigger, it's got more pedals, it's louder, it can do more stuff. When Beethoven starts off, he doesn't have a piano that can do this. He actually just cannot do this. He can't go -- (Musical chords) Can't do that. So in 1803, a French piano maker -- alright, think about how smart this is: If you're a piano maker, into whose hands do you want to get that piano? Composers. Artists who will use the technology and make everybody else have to adopt your technology. It's like sending Bill Gates your fastest, latest computer, because you know he'll use up all the memory."", '06:33': '(Laughter)', '06:34': ""So in 1803, Érard sends Beethoven a new piano. And it has more notes. And it can do that. So the first thing Beethoven does is, he writes a piece that can do that. If you've got a German or a Viennese piano or a British piano, it can't do that. So what do you do? You've gone to the music store. And you've bought the latest Beethoven piano sonata, and you take it home, and you've got a five-octave piano that was the brand-spanking-new, latest technology last year. You start playing that new Beethoven piano sonata, and what happens? Not enough notes! You run out of room. So, in fact, Beethoven has the same relationship with his audience that Bill Gates does. He's a software producer, and he has to deal with the hardware."", '07:24': 'And what\'s interesting about this is that Beethoven was actually smarter than Bill Gates. So when Beethoven gets his new Érard piano, he\'s writing his third piano concerto, he goes and he gives a concert, and he and uses all those extra notes. But what does he do when he goes and gives the concert? He has to take the piano with him, because it\'s the only piano he has in Vienna that has those extra notes. So he plays the concerto on the piano. It\'s great. But he realizes, ""Oh, wait. Not everybody has one of these latest things. So he publishes piano sonatas -- He waits; he delays: for the next 10 years, he still publishes piano sonatas that don\'t use the extra notes. He actually waits, because -- This idea of Beethoven? Everything you know about Beethoven -- basically wrong. Beethoven was a very clever entrepreneur. So the music he wrote for the popular market -- not the pieces he was going to play himself, but the piano sonatas -- he limits himself to the amount of keys that you have at home in some part of Southern Italy, where you have last year\'s piano.', '08:24': ""So what are the effects of these disruptions in music technology? How do composers, how do people respond? We've had three of these things, and they really all worked the same way. We started off with printing and the piano. The very first thing that happens is: it redefines the product. So the product becomes sheet music, becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home. In the 20th century, it becomes a record, something that you then take home. In the 21st century, it becomes a digital file. The nature of the product changes."", '08:56': 'Second, there\'s a division of labor. If you want to listen to Bach, you\'ve got to go listen to Bach; there\'s no other way to do this. In the 19th century, we\'ve got performers, and we\'ve got composers, people who do different things. We have listeners who can now manipulate music like you just saw. It changes expectations of quality. Once everybody\'s heard Count Basie and Benny Goodman, maybe you\'re not quite so happy with your local band as much anymore. You\'ve now heard ... -- ""I want to go listen to Benny Goodman some more."" You have now a global market. You can hear things that you didn\'t use to hear. Every time this happens, we take away some social interaction. With Beethoven, you can now play Beethoven at home. You can\'t play Mozart at home. But with Beethoven, you can buy the sheet music, you can go home, you can close the door and play the piano. And only you are there. Now you have headphones that do the same thing.', '09:49': 'With each of these disruptions, it changes the amount of social interaction. It\'s a new personalized experience each time. I can play Beethoven the way I want to. I can play it faster, I can play it slower. I can actually personalize the experience now. There\'s more consumer choice, the marketplace gets bigger. The number of titles on sale in those music stores goes up. But there\'s also less choice, because in a global pyramid, you can\'t always tell what you want. There\'s so much choice out there. How do you pick? And so marketing starts to come in, and ""Who is the flavor of the month?""', '10:20': 'There\'s one more thing that\'s not on the list: piracy. One of Haydn and Chopin\'s biggest worries is that people were going to write fake Chopin and put ""Chopin"" on it. Do you think Chopin would have been comforted by the thought, ""Hey, 20 percent of the people who buy fake Chopin are more likely to go buy real Chopin""? I mean -- I don\'t know.', '10:42': '(Laughter)', '10:43': 'But Chopin, another clever entrepreneur -- you know what he does? He publishes his music in Italy, France, Germany and England on the same day, because there\'s no international copyright, so he\'s got to have everything published on the same day. And he puts differences in every country. So if you\'re playing Chopin, the additions from different countries are different on purpose, because he wanted to be able to track who was a pirate. So, this wasn\'t something that Sony thought of. So, the question is ... This new technology, it makes more choice for more people, it makes it more global, but it also allows more piracy. It also allows for people to have a marketing filter. They have some way to interact that\'s not always direct. So the next time somebody says, you know, ""Nothing like the internet ever happened."" Well, it\'s true, but these kinds of disruptions in music technology have happened before.', '11:38': ""And the model for these disruptions is the same as we see in other kinds of businesses. It changes the nature of the product. So if you're in book publishing, you thought you were in book publishing because of these things called books. Well, you can still sell novels without books. You can still be in the music business even though you're not in the record business. You were selling records only because that was the technology that you inherited. Newspaper business: dead. But journalism isn't dead."", '12:06': ""And finally, schools. School is the next big horizon, because what were we in the business of? Schools used to be like buying gas or buying food; they had to have local entry points all over the place. But now, with the internet, we have a different distribution system.

https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_basting_how_to_meaningfully_reconnect_with_those_who_have_dementia,How to meaningfully reconnect with those who have dementia,"By incorporating art and creativity into elder care settings, gerontologist Anne Basting helps families reconnect with loved ones who have dementia. In this moving talk, she shares how asking ""beautiful questions"" -- questions that don't have a right or wrong answer -- opens up a shared path of discovery, imagination and wonder. ""If we can infuse creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making,"" Basting says. ""In that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.""",0:14:40,14.66666667,172948,2020-05-21T15:02:42+00:00,"['health care', 'art', 'creativity', 'communication', ""Alzheimer's"", 'brain']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'български', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)']",Anne Basting,Creative gerontologist,"{'00:05': 'Thirty years ago, I walked into a nursing home, and my life changed forever. I was there to visit my grandmother Alice. She was a very powerful woman who had lost a battle with a stroke that stole her ability to speak. Alice had just three forms of communication left. She had this sound that was like, ""tss, tss, tss,"" that she could shift in tone from emphatic, ""no, no, no,"" to enticing, ""yes, you\'ve almost got it."" She had an incredibly expressive index finger, which she could shake and point with frustration. And she had these enormous pale blue eyes that she could open and close for emphasis. Wide open seemed to say, ""Yes, you\'ve almost got it,"" and closing slowly was -- well, it didn\'t really need much translation.', '01:13': 'It turns out that Alice had taught me that everyone has a story. Everyone has a story. The challenge for the listener is how to invite it into being, and how to really hear it.', '01:31': 'Now, Alzheimer\'s and dementia, these are two words that, when you say them in front of people, you can watch a cloud descend over them. You can imagine me at dinner parties. ""What do you do?"" ""Well, I invite people with Alzheimer\'s and dementia into expression. Where are you going?""', '01:51': '(Laughter)', '01:53': ""Fear and stigma wrap themselves so tightly around an experience that affects 47 million people across the world, and they can live with this diagnosis for between 10 and 15 years, and that number, 47 million, is supposed to triple by 2050. Family and friends can fade away, because they don't know how to be in your company, they don't know what to say, and suddenly, when you need other people the most, you can find yourself really painfully alone, unsure of the meaning and the value of your own life."", '02:32': ""Science is pushing for treatments, dreaming of cures, but loosening that grip of stigma and fear could ease the pain of so many people right now. And luckily, meaningful connection doesn't take a pill. It takes reaching out. It takes listening. And it takes a dose of wonder."", '03:00': 'That really has become my unending quest, set in motion by Alice and then later on by really countless elders in nursing homes and day centers and those struggling to stay at home. And it comes down to the question of how. How do you meaningfully connect?', '03:21': 'I got a big part of that answer from a long-married couple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I\'m from, Fran and Jim, whom I met on a rather dreary winter day in their tiny, little kitchen in a humble duplex over by Lake Michigan. And when I walked in, Fran and a caregiver and a care manager greeted me really warmly, and Jim stood staring straight ahead, silent. He was on a long, slow journey into dementia and was now beyond words. I was there as part of a project team. We were doing what we called ""artistic house calls,"" with a really simple goal of inviting Jim into creative expression, and hopeful in modeling for Fran and the caregivers how they could meaningfully connect using imagination and wonder. Now, this was going to be no small task, because it turns out Jim had not spoken in months. Could he even respond if I invited him into expression? I didn\'t know.', '04:33': 'Family members, when they try to connect, most commonly will invoke a shared past. We say things like, ""Do you remember that time?"" But nine times out of 10, the pathway for that one answer to travel in the brain is broken, and we\'re left alone with a loved one in the fog.', '04:54': 'But there is another way in. I call them beautiful questions. A beautiful question is one that opens a shared path of discovery. With no right or wrong answer, a beautiful question helps us shift away from the expectation of memory into the freedom of imagination, a thousand possible responses for people with cognitive challenges.', '05:23': 'Now, back in the kitchen, I did know one thing about Jim. I knew that he liked to walk along Lake Michigan, and when I looked around that kitchen, I saw, over by the stove, this trunk that was just covered in little pieces of driftwood. And I thought, ""I\'ll try a question that he could answer without words."" So I tried, ""Jim, can you show me how water moves?"" It was silent for a while, but then really slowly he took a step over to that trunk and he picked up a piece of the driftwood and he held it out, and then very slowly he began to move his arm, leading with that driftwood. In his hand, it became buoyant, in sync with the motion of the waves that he made with his arms. It began this slow journey across calm waters, this gentle rolling to the shore. Transferring his weight from left to right and back again, Jim became the waves. His grace and his strength just took our breath away. For 20 minutes, he animated one piece of driftwood after the other. Suddenly, he was not disabled. We were not gathered in this kitchen for a care crisis. Jim was a master puppeteer, an artist, a dancer.', '07:28': 'Fran later told me that that moment had been a turning point for her, that she learned how to connect with him even as he progressed through the dementia. And it really became a turning point for me, too. I learned that this creative, open-ended approach could help families shift, expand their understanding of dementia as more than just tragic emptiness and loss into also meaningful connection and hope and love. Because, creative expression in any form is generative. It helps make beauty and meaning and value where there might have been absolutely nothing before. If we can infuse that creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making, and in that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.', '08:41': ""But so many settings of care offer bingo and balloon toss. Activities are passive and entertainment-oriented. Elders sit and watch and applaud, really just distracted until the next meal. Loved ones trying to keep their partners at home sometimes don't have anything to do, and so they resort to watching television alone, which compounds the symptoms of dementia with what researchers now tell us really are the devastating impacts of social isolation and loneliness."", '09:29': ""But what if meaning-making could be accessible to elders and their care partners wherever they lived? I've really been totally transformed and captivated by bringing these creative tools to caregivers and watching that spark of joy and connection, discovering that creative play can remind them of why they do what they do."", '09:56': 'Bringing this creative care to scale could truly shift the field. But could we do it? Could we infuse it into a whole care organization or an entire care system?', '10:13': 'The first step towards that goal for me was to assemble a giant team of artists and elders and caregivers in one care facility in Milwaukee. Together, over two years, we tackled reimagining the story of Homer\'s ""Odyssey."" We explored themes. We wrote poems. Together, we created a mile-long weaving. We choreographed original dances. We even explored and learned Ancient Greek with the help of a classics scholar. Hundreds of creative workshops we embedded into the daily activities calendar and invited the family members to join right along with us, and had caregivers and staff from every single area of care collaborating on programming for the first time. The culminating moment was an original, professionally produced play that blended the professional performers right alongside the elders and the caregivers, and we invited a paying audience to follow us from scene to scene, one in the nursing home, in the assisted living dining room, and finally in the chapel for the final scene where a chorus of elders all playing Penelope lovingly welcomed Odysseus and the audience home. Together, we had dared to make something beautiful, to invite elders, some with dementia, some on hospice, into making meaning over time, to learn and grow as artists. All this in a place where people were dying every day.', '12:11': 'I find myself now in a place where I\'m having to tackle this challenge of meeting a person with dementia across that gap in a more personal way. At a family dinner over the holidays, my mother, who was seated next to me, turned to me and said, ""Where\'s Annie?"" My funny and beautiful and feisty mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s. And I found myself in that place that everyone dreads. She didn\'t recognize me. And I had to figure out fast if I could do what I\'d been coaching thousands of other people to do, to connect across that gap. ""Do you mean Ellen?"" I said, because my sister\'s empty chair was just right across the table from us. ""She just went to the bathroom."" And my mother looked at me, and then something deep inside sparked, and she reached out and smiled and touched my shoulder and she said, ""You\'re right there."" And I said, ""Yes, I am right here.""', '13:32': 'I know that that moment is going to happen again and again, not just for me and my mom but for all 47 million people across the world and the hundreds of millions more who love them.', '13:46': 'How will we answer this challenge that is going to touch the lives of every family? How are our care systems going to answer that challenge? I hope it is with a beautiful question, one that invites us to find each other and connect. I hope our answer is that we value care and that care can be generative and beautiful. And that care can put us in touch with the deepest parts of our humanity, our yearning to connect and make meaning together all the way to the end.', '14:33': 'Thank you.', '14:34': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had no experience with the legal system, no money, and no power in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out over the next several months, Truth raised funds, strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding.', '00:54': 'Truth was born into slavery as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of indentured servitude until their mid-20s.', '01:13': 'Throughout this period, enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children remained in bondage. It would be two years before she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait another two years before she saw any of her other children.', '02:01': 'During this time, Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on Biblical references, spiritual ideals, and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary speaking tour.', '02:56': 'Truth saw her journey as a mission from God. Her faith often led her to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer, until they had no desire to harm her.', '03:37': 'Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government.', '04:02': 'Truth continued to travel and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful and will prevail.""'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot to learn about her mother, and herself.', '00:51': 'In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, ""The Joy Luck Club,"" this gathering at the mahjong table is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself is loosely structured to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, each with four chapters. Alternately set in China or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club or their American-born daughters.', '01:24': 'These stories take the reader through war zones and villages of rural China, and into modern marriages and tense gatherings around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes the family for years to come.', '02:00': 'These tales illustrate the common divides that can form between generations and cultures, especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them with who they really are. ""Does my daughter know me?"" some of the stories ask. ""Why doesn’t my mother understand?"" others respond.', '02:52': 'In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated from their homeland and disconnected from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle their present-day problems through the values their mothers passed on to them.', '03:15': 'When ""The Joy Luck Club"" was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood by the ones you love.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get to the local store which is near my flat, I get near the aisle where there\'s bunch of cookies, and I\'m standing there with a gaze, and I notice there\'s a little girl next to me. She\'s about four or five, let\'s call her Lucy. And Lucy has that same smile on her face like, ""All of these are going to be mine!"" At that moment, I just take one or two packs for myself, she sees how I do this, she\'s like, ""Aha, this is how it works."" She takes ten of them, puts them in her armpits and victoriously goes to the cashier\'s office. And you have that sensation there\'s like ponies and rainbows and the sun is shining and she\'s going to have a blastly Friday. I gather my stuff, get to the cashier\'s, and I notice we are in the same queue. Lucy is there with her mom, she\'s thrown all the cookies there in the basket and unfortunately, as life is, mom takes all the cookies out, just leaves one pack. And when she takes them out, you notice that the sunshine and rainbows slowly start to fade. And that\'s when Lucy starts to become a bit grim, she becomes a bit angry and starts to say, ""Wait, wait, hold on there Sparky, what\'s going on?"" And then she realizes this is not going to end well, and those rainbows and sunshine turn into rainy clouds and a thunderstorm, and that small sweet Lucy isn\'t sweet Lucy anymore. She becomes angry and shouts, and yells, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me? Why? I want those cookies!"" and so on and starts to cry suddenly. And then there\'s kind of a fuss around the situation - everybody looks at how the mom is going to react - and at this magical moment, all of you probably know, a magical thing happens. Somewhere from the store, the granny appears. (Laughter) She appears and starts to have an opinion, of course, on the matter. ""Oh, in my time, things were different."" Yada yada yada. Let\'s pause for a brief moment here. What you\'ve just heard is basically a part of my daily life. Being a medical doctor and a psychotherapist, I hear a lot of stories which people go through. And there is this myth that you have to, as a doctor, distance yourself a bit from patients in order to not get too involved, too attached and so on, which is not quite true. When you are a psychotherapist, you need to actually let yourself feel to some degree, to some extent what the patient feels. How that works is not magic, it\'s simple biology. You have a part of your brain that is called the limbic system, which is responsible for how you feel, where your emotions, yours and mine, reside. And when you have an emotional reaction, it\'s never logical, it\'s neurophysiological, it\'s biology, it could be completely illogical. And when somebody feels something, you can start to feel in a similar manner. To give you an example, few years ago, me and my girlfriend were asked to babysit our friend\'s infant. Let\'s call him David. David is about eight, yeah, eight months old. We arrive at their place, we go in, and you have like a déjà vu feeling, like sunshine and rainbows and ponies. Everything is great, you go in, it\'s going to be a blasty evening. The parents leave; we have a very nice time with David. But the infant who is eight month old is at a very special age. Everything\'s kind of nice up until one point David notices something. ""You\'re not my real parents, now, are you?"" (Laughter) At which point, David starts to cry, as babies do. For five minutes. ""Oh, David, it\'s going to be fine."" ""We just have to caress him, maybe put him to bed."" Fifteen. OK, then. ""Let\'s change the diaper."" ""Yeah, sure, let\'s change the diaper."" We change the diaper. Twenty five, for Christ\'s sake. ""Let\'s feed him?"" ""Yes, let\'s feed him!"" We feed him. Forty. At this point, you start to have various ideas in your head, like, for example, ""David! Shut up, David! Please shut up!"" or that you would just leave him somewhere, or you could just ignore him for the rest of the evening. But you realize you can\'t do that. An hour. An hour and ten. And I remember so vividly, my girlfriend was holding David in her hands, and he\'s still crying, We\'re standing in the doorway, we look at each other, and we realize we\'re screwed! At that moment, what basically happens on a neurobiological level, you can\'t act out in this instance when you want to shake David, you want to put him away, you want to do something else. But it\'s interesting to notice in yourself how you actually feel. And how I actually felt at that moment was completely helpless, angry, in despair, scared at the same time, I don\'t know what to do. If you think about it, it\'s the same way how David feels. He\'s been abandoned by his parents - bastards left him all alone with these two strangers at home. God knows what they\'re doing. So he\'s abandoned, all alone, helpless, hopeless and scared. And the only thing you can do in this instance is to just be there with him and to feel him and to help him in his feelings what he\'s feeling. It\'s interesting, when we start to feel something, how our minds change, kind of to some degree tell us what we actually feel. Every single one of us has been born with a completely different set of a brain, how we experience feelings, how intensively that happens - but we experience all the same feelings. The odd thing is while we are growing up we are taught, mostly by our parents,  what feelings to feel and not to feel. Stereotypes exist because to some degree, they are true. If we are very open about things, then if I ask the ladies of the audience you\'ll probably want your men to be emotional, right? I can just - ""No."" Someone said no. No? See? Proves my point! So, to some degree you want him to be emotional, but if you\'re very open to yourself, you don\'t want the whole emotional spectrum. You want him to be firm and stable, a man on a high horse - or Mercedes, whatever you prefer. But you don\'t want that embarrassment, the shame, the fear, the excessive jealousy. You don\'t want that, do you? The same question would be for the men. You do want your lady next to you to be emotional, right? Of course not. You want her to be on the shy side, maybe be afraid sometimes. You\'re going again ride on your high horse and your Mercedes, and save them from despair, but ... good girls don\'t get angry, do they? You don\'t like the hysteria, you don\'t like the anger. These are the stereotypes that are taught to kids already from day one, to basically eradicate some of the feelings that they have. And the more the years go by, you start to actually think you don\'t feel something, and then you put your feelings somewhere else. You start to think you\'re angry at somebody else, you start to think you\'re afraid or ashamed of something else, which is not quite true. To maybe not talk so much broadly and saying everything about you, I\'d like to share the story about me, how my feelings get in the way of my work. Four months ago, I received one of the worst phone calls you can get. In the evening, when I finished my work, my mom called me and told me those words I was always afraid to hear from her: that my father had passed away. And I remember when I came home, how filled with rage I was. I screamed and I yelled, I broke some furniture in my apartment. And my girlfriend was there to see that thing happening to me. Of course, the funeral goes by and life goes on. Then you start to notice something interesting, that some weeks have passed, and walking on the streets to work, I don\'t even think about my dad in any way, any shape or form, but I\'m looking at the people around me, and I notice a feeling in myself: I hate every single one of them. I hate their smile, even hate babies that I see. You start to notice, What the hell is happening to me? You get to work, you\'re angry at your colleagues. You want to tell them how important it is to cherish relationships, how important it is to do stuff, to do things on time, not to let things go, and so on and so on and so on. Months have passed, and I was asked to do this TED Talk. I was preparing the speech for my TED Talk, and every single time I did it, I realized it is not good enough. This isn\'t good enough, that isn\'t good enough. At some point, I even had the idea I\'m going to cancel this whole TED thing. I called up my mom and said, ""You know, I think I\'m going to give up all this TED thing. I don\'t want to do it."" And she said, ""Why?"" ""Well, because, I don\'t know, because I am going to stand there and don\'t know what I\'m going to say and so on."" And then it hit me, why I didn\'t want to be here. It\'s not because I don\'t know what to say. I give lectures all the time. I know what I am going to talk about. The reason why I didn\'t want to be here because I know I would feel something standing right here. What I am actually feeling right now. I notice my heart racing. I notice that I\'m sad that he is not here. He\'s not going to call me after this lecture. I notice that I\'m angry that that\'s an inevitable thing of life. At the same time, I\'m to some degree maybe scared or ashamed: What if I drop a tear while I\'m talking to you? How awful is that going to look? But I didn\'t finish the story about Lucy, did I? If we go back to Lucy, Lucy\'s mom could\'ve done anything. She could\'ve told her, ""That\'s not how a girl behaves. Look at that granny who\'s shouting at you. Look at the man, that tall man behind you, he is looking weirdly at you."" I\'m looking what was actually happening. And she didn\'t just keep silent and not say anything. She didn\'t devalue her, she didn\'t condemn her, she didn\'t do anything of the sort. All she did was to get the groceries that she had, took Lucy on her arms, and I heard her just so vaguely that Lucy continued to tell mom, ""I want those cookies so badly,"" and ""I wanted them."" And the only thing Lucy\'s mom said to Lucy was, ""I know, honey. I know you did. But it\'s OK to be angry, it\'s OK to be sad."" And I remember I\'m walking home from this very simple scene any one of you has maybe already seen. I go in my apartment. My girlfriend meets me. She asks me, ""Well, how was your day?"" I said, ""I started off with a smile on my face,"" said, ""I just saw a girl not get any cookies."" She\'s like, ""What? Are you OK?"" I\'m probably in a psychotic state right now. I said no. I told her the whole story about the store. And at some point I notice that my smile turns into a single tear that I have. She asked me, ""Why are you crying? Is everything OK?"" I said ""No. I miss him, like a lot."" And the hardest thing about feelings, actually, is that it\'s easy, to some degree, to think about them in your head. But it\'s much harder to actually express them out loud. And all of my patients every single time ask me one of the same questions: ""What\'s the difference that I tell you that I\'m angry, I\'m scared, I\'m helpless, I\'m hopeless, I\'m happy? What\'s the difference?"" And I tell them, ""This is the difference, that somebody\'s here - this time it\'s me - who actually doesn\'t just understand what you are going through, but I feel what you\'re feeling to a certain amount."" Question always is, The experiences we have in life, how will that impact your and my ability to, let\'s say, be there with somebody and feel these feelings? The same way as David needed somebody to be there, the same way Lucy needed somebody to be there, even I need somebody there to be there for me. And I hope every single one of you has the experience that not somebody understands you, but somebody feels you. Thank you.

It wasn't until 2017 and an unexpected conversation about LGBTQ rights in an Orlando mosque that she found herself reckoning with the influence of religion on marginalized lives. ""I realized that I couldn't run away from religion anymore because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world,"" she says. In this hopeful talk, she points out plentiful evidence that religious institutions are capable of embracing LGBTQ rights and that the process begins with having that first difficult conversation.",,,162790,2020-06-30T15:20:19+00:00,"['LGBT', 'humanity', 'religion', 'global issues', 'activism']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Polski', 'Português de Portugal']",Lyra McKee,"Freelance journalist, writer, editor","{'0:00': 'There are people in the world who if they\'re telling you a story need to tell you 19 other stories first before they can get to the point. I\'m one of those people. I want to tell you a story about a conversation I witnessed in a mosque, which changed my life. But to tell you that story, I have to tell you another story first, and I\'ve only got 12 minutes. And that story starts in late night, early June, this year. I got the opportunity to go on a trip to the United States with a delegation from around the UK - I was the only one from Northern Ireland - and we were going there to learn about \'American values\'. We were going to be travelling across Washington, Florida, and Texas, meeting with everyone from guns rights lobbyists to religious leaders and LGBT groups, people who spanned the spectrum of American values. So the thing about these trips is they offer you a number of perks. They offer you carrots they can dangle in front of you whenever the going gets tough, when you are in the 100th meeting of the day with someone whose views you find absolutely reprehensible and you\'re really struggling to stay the course. In our case, they took us to Disneyland, which I can confirm is definitely one of the happiest places on earth. I was in my element. Then they took us to NASA, which, as a Star Wars nerd, I have to say, competed in my heart for the title of \'Happiest Place on Earth\'. Someone very helpful pointed out to me - because I was posting selfies of myself at that time, running around Florida in vest tops - and someone very helpfully pointed out that I seemed to have more vests than Rab C. Nesbitt. (Laughter) I know the theme of the conference is \'bridges\': I felt like burning that one, to be quite frank. Then we got to go to this beautiful beachside resort called Cocoa Beach and sip cocktails on the beach; it was absolutely wonderful. You\'re probably thinking, ""Where do I sign up for this trip?"" ""This sounds amazing, it\'s a free jolly!"" That\'s what I thought it was when I looked at the itinerary. But I had to go through hell to get these perks. I realise that Disneyland and NASA, that these were all carrots they were dangling in front of us, whenever I found myself less than 10 feet away from the chief orangutan in the White House. (Laughter) El Trump. People ask me, ""What\'s the hardest thing  about standing 10 feet away from Donald Trump?"" I think it was seeing how badly his fake tan was applied. (Laughter) I did redeem my conscience when I got to Florida, I should say, and we met these lovely protestors, who, in case you can\'t see, are holding a \'Stop Trump\' sign. They were right up my alley; I thought they were fantastic. Our next visit was to a place called the National Rifle Association. It is all the guns rights lobbyists who come out in wake of every mass shooting and defend the right of Americans to bear arms. For a number of people in the group,  this was the most difficult part of the trip. They found it very difficult to sit there and listen and exchange views, which was what the whole trip was about. For me though, the hardest part of the trip was when we got to Orlando and they told us we were going to be visiting a mosque. Now you ask yourself, Why would I find it hard to visit a mosque? Well, for those of you who don\'t have Gaydar, I\'m gay - don\'t worry, you can laugh, it\'s okay. (Laughter) I hated myself for much of my life because of what religion taught me about people like me. And when I stopped hating myself, I started hating religion. But I was intrigued by this mosque because it was in Orlando, and a year to the week that we were in Orlando, 49 people were slaughtered in a gay nightclub called Pulse. This mosque had led the response to that tragedy and had condemned it. I was intrigued by that. This was at a time when Christian churches in Orlando were refusing to bury some of the dead because they were gay. To have a mosque come out and condemn this was a big deal. One of the victims of Pulse that always stuck with me was Brenda Marquez Mccool. She was a woman who was out with her gay son that night in Pulse, supporting him. When the gunman unleashed his bullets, she threw herself in front of her son. He survived but she didn\'t. So I decided that I would go into this mosque with an open mind. I did, and we met with this lovely man called Bassem, who was one of the leaders in the mosque. We talked about everything, and eventually, Bassem and I had a conversation about LGBT rights and what Muslims think of gay people. Difficult, thorny subject, but we had a really pleasant conversation, but neither of us knew what was about to happen next. There was a young man on our trip who I\'ll call Mahmud, a young Muslim man. He was listening to the exchange between Bassem and I, and when we were finished talking, he spoke up and addressed Bassem. And he said, ""My best friend was gay, he was Muslim, and he comitted suicide."" And at this point, Mahmud burst into tears. He said, ""I did everything I could to save him, but I couldn\'t."" And he told us this story of how this young Muslim man couldn\'t live with being Muslim and being gay; he felt that the only option he had was to die by suicide. We were all crying in the mosque, I think, by that point. We were all mourning for this young Muslim man that we had never met and now that we would never get the chance to meet. You know, when I left religious education at 16, I swore that I was done with religion and I was never going back to it. I was never going to have another conversation that I could not help with another person of faith again. When I was in that mosque that day  and I was there to learn about American values, I ended up getting schooled on my own culture by a Muslim. Because I realised that I couldn\'t run away from religion anymore. Within the LGBT community, we have a saying that we tell people. We tell them that \'It Gets Better\'. What I realised that day was that it gets better for some of us; it gets better for those of us who live long enough to see it get better. I realised that I couldn\'t run away from religion anymore, because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world. It shapes the laws and how they treat LGBT people, which we can see from the lack of equal marriage in this country. And it shapes how we, LGBT people, feel about ourselves. The first lesson I learned about being gay was that it was evil and that I was going to hell for it. I learned that from the Bible. There were times I would cry in my bedroom as a teenager, bargaining with God, asking him not to send me to hell, because I was so convinced that I was going there. This text, this Bible, I know for so many people it offers them hope, it offers them salvation, but for me it offered a prison sentence. I think it\'s the same for a lot of other LGBT young people. LGBT suicide rates are through the roof. This is the percentage of trans youth alone in the UK who have attempted suicide over the course of the last year. We see these numbers play out in Northern Ireland locally, and we know this from trans youth services, who say they see it play out among their young people. What do we do about this? I feel the only answer is to change religious teaching of homosexuality and LGBT issues. I don\'t mean we berate Christians and shout at them or berate Muslims and shout at them. We need to do the one thing that I didn\'t want to do when I left school at 16: we need to have conversations, difficult conversations, and fight for the hearts and minds of those who oppose us. I\'ve studied this, and when you ask people like Megan Phelps-Roper, who was a member of the Westboro Baptist Church, a hate group in America, when you ask people like this, when you ask former neo-Nazis, the most extreme people, when you ask, ""What changed your mind? What made you abandon your views?"" they\'ll tell you the same thing: It was a conversation. Someone who they were opposed to struck up a conversation, and they learned that that person was not who they thought they were, and they got to a point where they could no longer hold those views. People tell me this isn\'t going to happen; there\'s no way the churches will change their teachings or the mosques will change their teachings. ""You\'re mad."" And I would have agreed with them. But six weeks ago, I was out in a gay bar - not this one - with my friend Jordan. He\'s from a Free Prebystarian DUP-voting family, from ""County LegenDerry."" I avoid that Londonderry-Derry thing, I hate that. We were out there with his mum, who is a Scottish Free-P who goes to church every Sunday, and she was out in this bar, supporting her gay son, just like Brenda Marquez McCool was out in Pulse that night supporting her gay son. Don\'t tell me there\'s no hope because for too many LGBT young people, that is the only thing they have that keeps them living. And by the way, that Free Presbytarian mother went into work the next day and told everyone about this amazing thing she\'d been to called a \'drag show\'. (Laughter) Now if you had told me that I\'d be sitting in a gay bar with one of Ian Paisley\'s disciples drinking cocktails, watching a drag show, I\'d have told you you were mad. (Laughter) What can you do? If you thought you were here to passively listen to me rant on: No, I\'ve got a job for you all. If any of you are uncomfortable with the thought of someone like me, please come up to me after this event and talk to me. I won\'t bite your head off, I won\'t call you a homophobe. We\'ll just have a conversation, and I\'ll show you that I\'m human just like you. If you are comfortable with the thought of someone like me, have a conversation with someone who isn\'t and try to change their mind. Because you could be saving a life. Finally, I\'d like to send a message to all LGBT young people that are currently struggling, especially those from faith backgrounds. ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."" Jeremiah 29:11 This talk is in memory of the Pulse 49 and all LGBT people who died by suicide. Thank you very much, folks.

Joe said he was getting flooded with complaints from patients who had recently been switched to generic drugs. Joe was a trained pharmacologist and cohost of a radio show on NPR. Patient after patient said their generics were causing unwelcome side effects or even relapses. Joe believed the patients\' claims. But when he reported these complaints to the FDA, officials there argued, ""It was probably psychosomatic. Patients are upset by pills that look different from their old ones."" Joe didn\'t buy it. He wanted someone with investigative firepower to dig into this, and since I was an investigative journalist, he called me. And then he posed a question that I couldn\'t get out of my head: ""Katherine, what is wrong with the drugs?""', '01:17': 'I spent the next 10 years trying to track down the answer. Our health care system relies on generics. My family does, too. But a decade of interviews, meetings with whistleblowers, on-the-ground reporting across four continents and thousands of confidential files -- from the FDA, from generic drug companies and from the courts -- all pointed me in the same direction: a large number of generic drug manufacturers in certain overseas countries are passing off substandard drugs as legitimate generics for profit. They are deliberately flouting FDA regulations and standards. Basically, they are committing fraud.', '02:16': 'In the process, they are risking the health of patients around the world. They may even be costing patient lives. One leading company in India has already shut down because of this activity. I wanted to know, was that company an outlier or the tip of the iceberg? What I uncovered is disquieting, and anyone who takes generic drugs has the right to be deeply concerned.', '02:52': ""If you're skeptical about any of this, that's fair. I saw generics as one of the world's great public health innovations, a giant win for patients worldwide. Ninety percent of our drugs today are generic. I knew generic HIV/AIDS medicine had saved many lives in Africa. Here at home, programs from Medicare to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act depended on them. In an overpriced drug market, generics were the heroic underdog. But my biggest assumption was based on the FDA's reassurance that properly regulated generic drugs are not only safe and effective, but bioequivalent, interchangeable with the brand and with one another. Well, that's true -- if companies follow the rules on paper. But inside far-flung drug plants, I uncovered a different, unwritten set of rules."", '04:00': 'I started my investigation by focusing on the regulatory framework. Right away, one fact surprised me: the FDA does not vet manufacturer applications by testing the drugs. Instead, it reviews company data.

It\'s the honor system?', '04:43': '(Laughter)', '04:46': 'After nine months of digging, I published my first article on generics. I wrote about patients who\'d been switched to generic drugs and suffered medical setbacks. I quoted doctors who questioned whether generics really were bioequivalent to the brand. A month later, I got an anonymous email from someone calling himself ""Four Dollar Refill.""', '05:14': '(Laughter)', '05:15': 'Four dollars is what you\'d pay to fill a generic prescription at Walmart. Four Dollar Refill worked inside the generic drug industry. He said if I really wanted to uncover the problem, I\'d better go look where the majority of our generic drugs are made: in India and China. Four Dollar Refill was right; 80 percent of the plants making the active ingredient for all our drugs, brand or generic, are overseas, mostly in China and India. Any generic drug company anywhere in the world wanting approval to sell its drugs into our market has to follow elaborate rules known as ""Good Manufacturing Practices.""', '06:07': ""I decided to learn every detail of how to manufacture a legitimate generic drug. At a top New Jersey lab, I watched as technicians ran tests on specialized machines and used flasks that mimic stomach conditions to measure drug dissolution. But one remarkable fact jumped out. The lab banned Wite-Out -- correction fluid -- across its facility. Under FDA rules, data serves as the cornerstone of quality. It has to be gathered at each manufacturing step, preserved and shared with regulators. Wite-Out was high-risk. It invited tampering. It was clear that for the FDA's regulatory regime to succeed, any company applying for approval had to be ethical, and its data had to be unaltered. But what if neither was true? What if the applicant was not ethical? What if the data was not pristine?"", '07:26': ""I started to hear about a company in India called Ranbaxy, India's largest drug company, one of its first successful multinationals and one of the fastest-growing generic suppliers to the US market. A whistleblower was supplying internal Ranbaxy documents to the FDA. I got copies. Deciphering the company's charts, graphs and numbers unveiled a shocking swindle. They substituted unapproved, lower-purity ingredients. They invented documents like standard operating procedures, steaming them overnight in a sauna-like room to make them look old. They conjured up three-, six-, nine- and 18-month stability studies, all generated on the same day."", '08:30': ""Gradually, I was able to unearth the story behind this regulatory nightmare. In 2004, Ranbaxy hired a new research and development director. He suspected something was amiss. He ordered a young engineer named Dinesh Thakur to study the data in every drug application to find out if it was real or fake. Thakur eventually put together a devastating PowerPoint showing Ranbaxy had falsified data for over 200 products in more than 40 countries. The new R and D director showed this PowerPoint to a subcommittee of the board of directors. The subcommittee ordered the report and the laptop on which it was created destroyed. Then they forced Thakur out of the company. Thakur couldn't sleep, thinking about Ranbaxy's perilously bad drugs. So he risked his life to alert the FDA. After an eight-year investigation, Ranbaxy pled guilty to seven felonies for faking data."", '09:48': 'An FDA consultant taught me that just like cheap clothing made in distant factories, or ""fast fashion,"" as she called it, there were fast drugs, too, made in pharmaceutical sweatshops overseas with low-quality ingredients and manufacturing shortcuts. In Mexico City, I sat in a bar with a whistleblower. He handed me documents revealing how the cost-cutting generic drug plant where he worked had knowingly released drug batches that contained glass particles. In Accra, capital of Ghana, doctors explained how low-cost Indian and Chinese medicine of all kinds barely seemed to work, even when they doubled and tripled the doses. In Mumbai, I met another whistleblower from a company that I had believed was ethical. He sat there and described the well-oiled machinery of data manipulation his company used to get compromised drugs approved fast. With tears running down his cheeks, he said, ""What\'s going on in the industry is very, very, very dirty.""', '11:07': ""In the US, a confidential source who worked in the government handed me a thumb drive containing over 20,000 internal FDA documents. The emails and memos revealed how the agency's public health mission -- protecting consumers -- often clashed with its political mission -- showing Congress a steady stream of low-cost drug approvals. I also learned about the FDA's compromised inspection system for overseas drug plants. In the US, FDA investigators arrive unannounced to do surprise inspections. But overseas, the FDA gives manufacturing plants months of advance notice. It asks for the company's help arranging ground transportation and hotels. My sources also talked about staged inspections, where teams of data fabricators invent or alter needed documents to create a facade of compliance long before the FDA arrives."", '12:22': 'One intrepid FDA investigator named Peter Baker figured out how to find the truth. He ignored the data printouts, and he looked inside company computers. When files were deleted, he found metadata revealing hidden tests. The companies were prescreening their drugs, figuring how to alter the official tests so they would meet FDA specifications. As I said, this problem is more than a handful of bad actors. Over four years, Peter Baker inspected 86 plants in India and China. He found evidence of fraud in 67 of them.', '13:10': 'Wonder what happens to a batch of drugs that fails testing? It should get thrown out. Instead, low-cost plants usually sell them into poorly regulated markets that don\'t realize what they\'re getting, places like Africa, Southeast Asia and India itself. The overseas generics industry calls this ""dual-track production"" -- better drugs for some, failed drugs for others. In the developing world, this corrupt system has flooded the market with so many bad drugs that public health researchers link them to the rise of drug-resistant infections.', '14:02': ""But criminal behavior by overseas companies is only half the problem. Though some regulators apparently don't realize they're being conned, in the US, our regulators appear willing to overlook transgressions in order to continue green-lighting low-cost medicine. As a result, some American patients have gotten generic drugs with toxic impurities, unapproved ingredients, dangerous particulates or that are not bioequivalent. As the FDA investigator Peter Baker put it, if people actually understood, then nobody would take these drugs."", '14:46': ""Are there ways to solve this global problem? Yes, there are. Solutions begin with recognizing that our current honor system for drug regulation is a relic of a bygone age. Science evolves. Medicine evolves. The global economy evolves. Shouldn't regulation evolve with them? Only one approach can guarantee quality generics: rigorous oversight, including unannounced inspections and systematic testing of drugs. Rigorous oversight means that regulators don't just look at printouts of data that may or may not be genuine. Effective solutions also depend on giving the average patient more information. We know where our breakfast cereal and our running shoes are manufactured. Why is it different for generic drugs?"", '15:43': ""Patients can do something else. They can tell their elected officials and consumer organizations to speak up just as loudly to demand quality as they do to demand access. Consumer organizations can do their members a great service by testing and ranking generics, just like cars and washing machines. The big pharmacy chains owe it to the public to test the drugs they dispense. A trip to the pharmacy for affordable medicine shouldn't come with a hidden cost. Now is the time for all of us who care about patient safety to act on what we know."", '16:25': 'Thank you.', '16:27': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his 2016 TEDxMidAtlantic talk, he warns that we are entering a new era of secrecy that harkens back to Nixon's days. We think we are resilient, he says, but if we are infected with hate and lack of knowledge, we could lose our democracy.",,,160428,2018-09-12T14:59:32+00:00,"['politics', 'government', 'journalism']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Nederlands']",Bob Woodward,"Journalist, author","{'0:00': 'said, ""Well, it\'s going to be expensive."" And Nixon said, ""Well, how much?"" And Dean said, ""Well, a million dollars."" Nixon: ""Oh, I know where I can get that."" In the White House. Level of criminality which is astonishing. Then the whole series of investigations, special prosecutor of Senate Watergate Committee, the impeachment investigation of Nixon, and he resigns in August, 1974. And what happened there, he lived for 20 more years, and the fifth war was the war against history, to say, ""Oh, no, Watergate was really not that important. I did not commit impeachable offenses,"" having surrogates go out and say, ""Well, there are unanswered questions about Watergate"" - which there are. But I think in a very important way, you look at Nixon and this record on the tapes - what he did is - the presidency is supposed to be something that can do good for a majority of people in the country. Listen to those tapes; time and time again, it\'s ""Let\'s use the power of the Presidency as an instrument of personal revenge. Let\'s get the IRS, the FBI, the CIA on Nixon\'s real or perceived opponents."" The dog - and this is ultimately, I think, the final corruption of Nixon in Watergate - the dog that doesn\'t bark on the tapes. No one, to my knowledge, ever says, What does the country need? What would be good for the people? It\'s all in this vicious way of let\'s screw somebody, let\'s help Nixon\'s career, let\'s prosecute the Vietnam War  so he\'ll get reelected even though - in one memo in my latest book, Nixon actually wrote out, which we didn\'t know at the time, just found this out last year, he said, ""Well, the bombing has achieved zilch, nothing."" And what did he do the year he was running for reelection? He increased the bombing, intensified it: 1.1 million tons of bombs in Southeast Asia. So the day Nixon resigned, he called his aides, friends, cabinet officers to the East Room of the White House and had his wife, two daughters, son-in-law standing there, and there was no script - it was Nixon raw - and he talked about his mother and his father, and he was sweating. It was just a lot of people worried that he was going to come unglued, because it was televised nationally. Then at the end, Nixon kind of waved his hand, ""Ah, here is why I called you all here."" And he said the following: ""Always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don\'t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself."" Now think of the wisdom in that: hate was the poison, hate was what drove him and his presidency, and at that moment he had to leave office, he understood the poison and how hate had destroyed him, had put the country on edge, and if there is anything to reflect on now if you look back, as we\'ve seen the current presidential election, on the surface and underneath, there is too much contempt, too much hate, and that, if you think about it, we need to know what\'s really going on. We don\'t know enough, and if we don\'t know what\'s going on, the judge who said it got it right: ""Democracies die in darkness."" And history proves that. And we think we\'re resilient - I think we are. We think we\'re strong. We think that we have a process that will protect us from that. But if we are infected with hate and infected with the lack of knowledge - who these people really are, what\'s inside, what\'s driving them - we could partake of losing our wonderful democracy.

(This virtual conversation, hosted by current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers and head of TED Chris Anderson, was recorded on May 27, 2020.)",0:24:15,24.25,159482,2020-06-03T19:56:23+00:00,"['public health', 'coronavirus', 'technology', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'health', 'health care']","['English', 'Português de Portugal', 'Ελληνικά']",Karen DeSalvo,"Chief Health Officer, Google","{'00:04': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Before we really dive in to talking specifically about Google\'s work in the contact tracing space, let\'s first set up the relationship between public health and tech. You know, I think a lot of people, they hear ""Google,"" and they think of this big tech company. They think of a search engine. And there may be questions about why does Google have a chief health officer? So could you talk a little bit about your work and the work your team does?', '00:28': ""Karen DeSalvo: Yeah. Well, maybe I'm the embodiment of public health and tech coming together. My background is, I practiced medicine for 20 years, though a part of my work has always been in public health. In fact, my first job, putting myself through college, was working at the state laboratory in Massachusetts. As the story will go with Joia [Mukherjee] we're reconnected again, a Massachusetts theme. And I, across the journey of the work that I was doing for my patients to provide them information and the right care and meet them where they were medically, translated into the work that I did when I was the Health Commissioner in New Orleans and later when I had other roles in public health practice, that really is about thinking of people and community in the context in which they live and how we provide the best information, the best resources, the best services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, meet them where they are. And when the opportunity arose to join the team at Google, I was really thrilled, because one of the things that I have learned across my journey is that having the right information at the right time can make all the difference in the world. It can literally save lives. And billions of people come to Google every day asking for information, and so it is a tremendous opportunity to have that right information and those resources to people so that they can make good choices, so that they can have the right information, so that they can participate in their own health, but also, in the context of this historic pandemic, be a part of the broader health of the community, whether it's to flatten the curve or keep the curve flat as we go forward."", '02:07': ""WPR: And so it sounds like that there is this connection, then, between public health and what Google's work is in thinking about public education and providing information. And so could you talk a little bit about that link between public health and public education and Google?"", '02:23': 'KD: Definitely. You know, the essential public health services include communication and data, and these are two areas where tech in general, but certainly Google, has an opportunity to partner with the public health system and with the public for their health more broadly. You know, going back to the earlier days of this pandemic, towards the end of January, Google first leaned in to start to put information out to the public about how to find resources in their local community, from the CDC or from other authoritative resources. So on the search page, we put up ""knowledge panels,"" is the way that we describe it, and we did develop an SOS alert, which is something we\'ve done for other crises, and in this particular historic crisis, we wanted to be certain that when people went on to search, that there was authoritative information, which is always there but certainly very prominently displayed, and do that in partnership with public health authorities. So we began our journey really very much in an information way of making certain that people knew how to get the right information at the right time to save lives.', '03:37': ""I think the journey for us over the course of the last few months has been to continue to lean in on how we provide information in partnership with public health authorities in local areas, directing people in a certain state to their state's health department, helping people get information about testing. There's also been, though, a suite of resources that we wanted to provide to the health care community, whether that was for health care providers that may not have access to PPE, for example, we did a partnership with the CDC Foundation. Though the scale of the company and the opportunity for us to partner with public health around things like helping public health understand if their blunt policies around social distancing to flatten the curve were actually having an impact on behavior in the community. That's our community mobility reports. We were asked by public health agencies all across the world, including some of my colleagues here in the US, could we help them have a better evidence-based way to understand the policies around social distancing or shelter in place? Which I think we'll talk about more later. In addition to that sort of work, also been working to support public health in this really essential work they're doing for contact tracing, which is very human-resource intensive, very complex, incredibly important to keep the curve flat and prevent future outbreaks, and give time and space for health care and, importantly, science to do the work they need to do to create treatments and, very importantly, a vaccine. So that work around providing an additional set of digital tools, exposure notification for the contact tracing community, is one of the other areas where we've been supporting the public health."", '05:25': ""So we think, as we've thought about this pandemic, it's support the users, which is the consumer. There's also a health care system and a scientific community where we've been partnering. And then, of course, public health. And for me, I mean, Whitney, this is just a wonderful opportunity for Big Tech to come together with the public health infrastructure. Public health, as Joia was sort of articulating before, is often an unsung hero. It saves your life every day, but you didn't know it. And it is also a pretty under-resourced part of our health infrastructure, globally, but especially in the US. It's something I worked on a lot before I came to Google. And so the opportunity to partner and do everything that we can as a company and, in this case, with contact tracing in partnership with Apple to create a very privacy-promoting, useful, helpful product that is going to be a part of the bigger contact tracing is something that we feel really proud of and look forward to continuing to work with public health. In fact, we were on the phone this morning with a suite of public health groups from across the country, listening again to what would be helpful questions that they have. And as we think about rolling out the system, this is the way that we've been for the last many months at Google, and I'm just really ..."", '06:41': ""I landed at a place just a few months ago -- I just started at Google -- where we can have an impact on what people know all across the world. And I'll tell you, as a public health professional and as a doc, that is one of the most critical things. People need to have the right information so they can help navigate their health journey, but also especially in this pandemic because it's going to save lives."", '07:04': ""WPR: That's great. Thank you. So, to talk more about this contact tracing system and the exposure notification app, we've read so much about this. Could you describe this, a little bit about how the app works, what exactly are users seeing, what information is being collected? Just give us sort of a broad sense of what this app does."", '07:26': ""KD: Yeah. Let me just start by explaining what it is, and it's actually not even an app, it's just an API. It's a system that allows a public health agency to create an app, and only the API, this doorway to the phone system, is available to public health. So it's not designed for any other purpose than to support public health and the work that they're doing in COVID-19 in contact tracing."", '07:58': ""The second piece of this is that we wanted to build a system that was privacy-promoting, that really put the user first, gave them the opportunity to opt into the system and opt out whenever they wanted to do that, so they also have some control over how they're engaging and using their phone, basically, as a part of keeping the curve flat around the world."", '08:22': ""The system was developed in response to requests that we were getting about how could technology, particularly smartphones, be useful in contact tracing? And as we thought this through and talked with public health experts and academics and privacy experts, it was pretty clear that obviously contract tracing is a complex endeavor that does require human resources, because there's a lot of very particular things that you need to do in having conversations with people as part of contact tracing."", '08:56': 'On the other hand, there\'s some opportunity to better inform the contact investigators with things like, particularly, an exposure log. So one of the things that happens when the contact tracer calls you or visits you is they ask, ""Hey, in the last certain number of days,"" and in the case of COVID, it would be a couple days before symptoms developed, ""Hey, tell us the story of what you\'ve been involved in doing so that we can begin to think through where you might have been, to the grocery or to church or what other activities and with whom you might have been into contact."" There\'s some amount of recall bias in that for all us, like we forget where we might have been, and there\'s also an amount of anonymous contact. So there are times when we\'re out in the world, on a bus or in a store, and we may have come into prolonged and close contact with someone and wouldn\'t know who they were. And so the augmentation that the exposure notification system provides is designed to fill in those gaps and to expedite the notification to public health of who has a positive test, because the person would have notified, they trigger something that notifies public health, and then to fill in some of those gaps in the prior exposure.', '10:10': ""What it does not do is it does not use GPS or location to track people. So the system actually uses something different called Bluetooth Low Energy, which is privacy-preserving, it doesn't drain the battery and it makes it more also interoperable between both Apple and the Android system so it's more useful, not only in the US context, but globally. So we built this system in response to some requests to help augment the contact-tracing systems. We wanted to do it in a way that was user-controlled and privacy-preserving and had technological features that would allow public health to augment the exposure log in a way that would accelerate the work that they needed to get done to interrupt transmission -- keep the R naught less than one -- and do that in a way that we would also be able to partner with public health to think about risk scoring."", '11:04': ""We could talk more about any of these areas that you want, but I think maybe one of the most important things that I want to say, Whitney, is how grateful Apple and Google are -- I'll take a moment to speak for my colleagues at Apple -- to the great partnership from public health across the world and to academics and to others who have helped us think through how this can be, how the exposure notification system fits into the broader contact tracing portfolio, and how it does it in a way that really respects and protects privacy and also is useful to public health. We're still on this journey with them, and I really believe that we're going to be able to help, and I'm looking forward to being a part of the great work that public health's got to do on the front lines every day, been doing, frankly, but needs to be able to step up."", '11:52': ""WPR: That's great, and thank you for that really detailed explanation. And you know, we actually have Chris here with some questions from our community, so why don't we turn there really quickly."", '12:02': ""Chris Anderson: Yep. Questions pouring in, Karen. Here's one from Vishal Gurbuxani. Uh ... Gurbu -- I've pronounced that horribly wrong, but make up your own mind. Vishal, we'll connect later and you can tell me how to say that."", '12:15': ""KD: Fabulous last name. I love that. That's a Scrabble word."", '12:19': 'CA: ""Given where we are today, how should employees think about returning to work, with so many conflicting messages?""', '12:28': ""KD: This has been an important part of my work for the last few months. I joined Google in December, and all this started happening. The pandemic in the world first began in November but it got very hot in many parts of the world in the last few months, and we've been thinking a lot about how to protect Googlers but also protect the community. I've been talking a lot about what we've done externally. You know, internally, Google made a decision to go to work-from-home pretty early. We believed that we could. We believed that in all the places across the world where we have offices, that the more we could not only model but frankly just be a part of flattening the curve, that we would be good citizens. So we have been fairly ... I don't know if the right word is conservative or assertive, about it, because we really wanted to make sure that we were doing everything we could just to get people to shelter in place and socially distance. A lot of other companies have been doing the same, and I think the choices that people are making are going to be predicated on a whole array of factors: the rates of local transmission; governmental expectations; the ability to work from home; the individual characteristics of the workers themselves, how much risk they might have or how much risk it would be for them to bring that back into their household if they have people living in their household who would be at increased risk from morbidity, mortality, from suffering and death, from COVID. So these are individual and local considerations. I think for us as a company, we want to, as we've talked about publicly, we want to continue to be a part of the public health solution around social distancing, and so that for us means continuing to encourage work-from-home for our employees and really only be in if it's essential that people are in the workplace. And we've said publicly that we're going to be doing that for many months to come."", '14:28': ""Now, here's one thing I do want to say, which is, working from home has definite benefits, not only for the pandemic, but for some people, time for commute, etc. I think we're already learning there are some downsides, and there are generic downsides, even just not from work-from-home but school-from-home and just being at home, which is: social isolation is real. It causes depression. It has physical impacts on people's bodies; there's science around this. So as the world is weighing, even beyond the pandemic, when we've achieved herd immunity because we've been able to vaccinate the world with a functioning vaccine that creates immunity, I think probably a lot of workplaces are going to want to encourage work-from-home. But I just want us also to remember that part of humanity is community, and so we'll have to be thinking through how we balance those activities."", '15:30': 'CA: And, of course, there are huge swathes of the economy that can\'t work from home. We\'re a lucky few who can. And speaking of which, here\'s a question from Otho Kerr. ""Vulnerable communities seem to be receiving a disproportionate amount of misinformation. What is Google doing to help make sure these communities are receiving accurate news rather than fake news?""', '15:52': ""KD: You know, vulnerable communities is where I have spent most of my career focused. I think with many things that we've learned as a society in this pandemic were things that we, frankly, should have known. And before I get to the information, I'll just talk about access to services, which is to say, and to brag, I guess, on my hometown of New Orleans. One of the early things that New Orleans learned, or remembered or whatever, was that drive-through testing only works if you have a car. So you need walk-up testing, and it needs to be in the neighborhood. We need to meet people where they are, and it's thematic of all the work that we did after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was to build back a health care and public health infrastructure that was community-oriented, built with community not for community. Of all the many things that I really do hope last from this pandemic, one of them, though, is that we're being much more conscious of building with especially vulnerable communities and building out policies and processes that are as inclusive as possible."", '16:59': 'For Google information, we start with, on the search platform, for example, adding up knowledge panels, that we spend time making sure are linguistically and culturally appropriate. We tend to start globally, with global authoritative groups like the World Health Organization or the National Health Service or CDC, and then we begin to build down to more focused jurisdictions. On other platforms that we have like YouTube, we\'ve built out special channels where we do, because it\'s a platform and we can host content, we\'ve partnered with creatives -- we call them, I don\'t know, that\'s a new thing for me because I\'m a doctor -- but we\'ve partnered with creatives and influencers whose reach resonates with communities. We have had particular programming, for example, for seniors, African-Americans, so ""vulnerable"" takes on a lot of meaning for us globally and in the US context. Our work is not done, and we certainly every day are thinking about how we can do more to see that the information is accessible, accurate and also, frankly, interesting so that people want to engage.', '18:10': ""CA: Yeah. Alright, thank you Karen. I'll be back in a bit with some other questions."", '18:17': ""WPR: Thank you, Chris. And you know, and this is really wonderful talking about more broadly, where you see tech and public health going, and specifically, talking about these vulnerable communities. And I think one thing, even just beyond Google, it would be interesting to sort of hear your thoughts on where you see tech in general better serving public health, if there are spaces that you think, no matter which tech company we're talking about, we could all sort of come together to better serve the community. Do you have any thoughts on that?"", '18:51': 'KD: I could spend several hours talking to you about that, but maybe I\'ll just start by saying that I came to tech through the pathway of direct patient care and public health service in local community, and I ended up in a role in the federal government as the National Coordinator for Health IT, which, for my background, felt unusual to me, I\'m just being honest. And I thought, well, I\'m not really a tech person, but the secretary at the time said, ""That\'s exactly why we need you, because we need to apply tech."" And she had had the unfortunate experience of hearing me chirp about how public health needed more timely data to make better evidence-based policy on behalf of community and with community. This was a source of frustration for me as a local public health officer, that sometimes the data I was working on, though great, was stale by the time I needed to make decisions about chronic disease interventions, or mental health or even violence or intimate partner violence issues in my community. And so the desire to make data useful and accessible to support people in communities is something that\'s been burning in me for a long time, and what I have learned since I have been out in Silicon Valley is that that desire burns in the bellies of many people who work at Google and Apple and other companies, and it\'s been really wonderful to see, during this horrible time of the pandemic, the incredibly brilliant engineering and programming and other minds at a company like Google turn their attention on how can we partner with consumers and with public health to do the right thing, to bring the resources that we have to bear.', '20:43': 'And I said I could talk all day about it because I have many examples from the work that we have done at Google. Maybe I\'ll just point out a couple. One is to say that we very early on wanted to find a crisp way to help people understand what they could to protect themselves and their community, to flatten the curve, get the R naught less than one, and this ""Do the Five"" work that our teams, largely in marketing but then a lot of other people weighed in. It required massive amounts of talent to make that available on our landing page, on search, and then fold it out more broadly. We did that in partnership with the World Health Organization, then the CDC, then with countries all across the world to get simple messaging about staying home if you can and coughing into your elbow, washing your hands. These are basic public health messages that public health has been, frankly, even in flu season trying to get the word out, but it became, the resources at a company like a Google, and the reach to billions, it\'s a platform and a set of talents that aren\'t even the technical, computer vision kind of stuff that you would typically think about. Many other companies in Silicon Valley have weighed in in the same way.', '22:00': ""I think similarly, we've been thinking through how we can use tools like the community mobility reports. This is something, a business backer like we have for restaurants. The engineers and scientists said, what if we applied that to retail and grocery stores and transportation to get a snapshot in a community of whether people were using those areas less, whether people were adhering to local public health expectations and sheltering in place, and give that information not only to public health but to the public to help inspire them to do more for their community as well as for themselves. So there has been, I think what I'm trying to say, Whitney, is I think there's a natural marriage, and COVID has been an accelerant use case to demonstrate how that can work, and it is my expectation that companies like Google who, certainly for us it's in our DNA to be involved in health, will want to continue working on this going forward, because it's really not just good for what we need to get done in this pandemic, but public health and prevention are part and parcel of how we create opportunity and equity in all communities across the world. So I'm passionate about the work of public health and very passionate about partnership. Can I just say one more thing?"", '23:26': 'WPR: Absolutely.', '23:27': ""KD: Which is to say that one of the first things that I did before the pandemic started, I had just started in December, and then in January, I did a listening session with consumers about what they wanted, and they said something kind of similar to what you said, which I just want to call out, and that is, they wanted partnership, they wanted transparency and they really felt like there was quite a lot that tech in general could do to help them on their health journey. But their ask was that we did it in a transparent way and we did it in a partnered way with them. And so as we move out of the pandemic, and we're thinking more about consumers, I want to carry some of this spirit also of prevention and helpfulness and transparency into the work that we're going to continue to do for people every day.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In minutes they stirred the camp into a panic, stole about 70 horses, and disappeared.', '00:27': 'Led by a young chief named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, or Comanches, and the United States forces sent to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel drew near his targets, they disappeared without a trace into the vast plains.', '01:05': 'The Comanches had controlled this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie faced off.', '02:03': 'Born around 1848, Quanah was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada.', '02:32': 'In the years that followed, Quanah proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma.', '03:39': 'As hunter-gatherers, they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised rations and supplies, but what they provided was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power compared to others who had been on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income for the Comanches on the reservation.', '04:27': 'As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders had supported him to lead them against the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment.', '05:07': 'Quanah acted in Hollywood movies and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both died shortly after their capture.', '05:34': 'Quanah adapted again and again— to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official in the tribe, recognizing him as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens and countless descendants.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_how_flags_unite_and_divide_us,How flags unite (and divide) us,"Flags are one of the simplest yet most powerful pieces of design ever conceived. They can make us swell with pride, burn with hatred -- and even inspire people to die or kill in their name, says vexillologist Michael Green. Take a brief walk through history as Green explores the symbolic fervor behind flags that unify and divide, inviting us to imagine a future where we can come together under one collective identity: humanity.",0:15:10,15.16666667,155767,2020-06-09T15:27:15+00:00,"['history', 'identity', 'design', 'product design', 'TEDx', 'global commons']","['Català', 'English', 'Español', 'Hrvatski', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)']",Michael Green,Vexillologist,"{'00:05': 'In 1989, an artist by the name of Dread Scott, who has also graced the TED stage, created a piece of art in Chicago, where he simply placed an American flag on the ground and then invited you the viewer to go and stand on that flag and record how it felt in a journal. And to me, one of the most powerful things written in that journal, in essence, says, ""Why are we so OK with homeless people, with human beings laying on the ground, but not flags?""', '00:41': ""And to some of you, this piece of art is quite disturbing. And that's kind of the point of this talk -- not to upset you or to make you mad but to prove to you that flags have an incredible power, and that even if you think you don't care about flags, you do. You know you do. Alright."", '01:01': ""By the end of it, I hope that you're inspired to go out and harness this power of flags and fight for a better world. But before we get there, we're going to start on the opposite end of the spectrum. And before I show you the next stuff, I need to say that anything I show here is not an endorsement, it's usually quite the opposite. But more than anything, what I want to do is create a space here where we can look at these flags, these designs, and examine how they make us feel. We're going to talk about our emotions. Is that OK with everybody?"", '01:34': 'OK. Are you ready for your first flag?', '01:39': ""Cool, we'll start with an easy one. That was a joke. (Laughs) So, some of you may be a little bit uneasy sitting in a room with this. I'm certainly feeling uneasy standing in front of it. Some of you may be feeling a little bit of pride. And that's understandable. This is Texas. This is not a rare sight, is it?"", '02:00': ""But let's start with the facts. So this is not the Confederate flag. OK? This is the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee. So next time someone tells you that this is their heritage, unless their family fought for that very specific militia, they're wrong, alright? And you have a flag expert's permission to tell them so. This flag rose into prominence during the mid-1950s and '60s as a response to the growing Civil Rights Movement. And then of course today, it has come to represent the Confederacy to most of us. But I shouldn't have to remind you what the Confederacy is. It was a rogue nation that rose up against the United States, waged war on the US, and at one point in time, this was one of the most un-American things you could have. But yet, this flag is protected by the same laws that protect the United States flag in the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana."", '03:06': ""But let's pick on Georgia for a second, shall we? So in 1956, a few years after desegregation was mandated in public schools, Georgia changed their state flag to this. I think everyone watching can agree that this was not meant to be a flag that every Georgian was proud to fly outside of their home, was it? No. Just like all of the Confederate statues erected in the mid-1950s and '60s, this was meant to be a symbol of who was in charge and who was not. This remained the flag of Georgia until the year 2001, and in that year, they changed their flag to this. Now, as a flag expert, I can tell you: this is officially ugly. OK? It's OK to laugh at this flag. It's ugly, and because it's so ugly, that's one of the reasons they changed it just two years later. They had a referendum where they got to choose between that thing and then what is now the current flag of Georgia."", '04:08': 'Now some of you might be wondering, ""Wait a second, Michael -- if that before wasn\'t the Confederate flag, what was the Confederate flag?"" Georgia flies the first flag of the Confederate States of America to this day. They just slapped their state seal on it.', '04:27': ""Well, let's go back to our emotions for a second. That didn't punch you in the gut as much as the other one did, did it? Right? And that's why I love flags. They are the simplest pieces of design, usually just two or three colors, just some bars or stripes. But yet, they can invoke the deepest emotions within us. They'll make us swell with pride or burn with hatred. We will die for a flag or even kill for one."", '05:01': 'One of my favorite designers, his name is Wally Olins, they call him the father of nation branding, and he\'s quoted as saying that ""Everyone wants to belong, and then they want to display symbols of belonging."" And it\'s crazy that these pieces of cloth that are just sewn together or dyed come to be such a sacred item, and that\'s because they become parts of our identity. They are powerful tools to unify but equally powerful tools to divide.', '05:34': ""You ready for the next flag? Right. Take a moment. Really examine how you felt when this hit the screen. I'm going to change the slide pretty quickly so you don't take pictures of me in front of this one."", '05:49': '(Laughter)', '05:50': 'Alright?', '05:51': 'So Germany after World War I, it was in a pretty bad state, and a young Adolf Hitler had a lot of -- let\'s call them -- ""ideas,"" of how Germany got to where they\'d gotten and how to get them out. He spent entire chapters in his book ""Mein Kampf,"" which I don\'t recommend reading, about how Germany lost World War I partially because the British had better graphic design and better propaganda.', '06:19': 'So, as the Nazi Party rose, Hitler created one of the thickest brand guides I\'ve ever seen. It\'s thicker than most company brand guides today, and in it, he details titles and uniforms and lots and lots of flags. Hitler knew the power of flags. He says in ""Mein Kampf,"" ""The new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster, [because] in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement."" He was an artist, after all. He knew the power of visual identity and uniforms could reignite the German identity. And to millions of Germans, this was a welcome sign. But of course, this was also a mark of death to others.', '07:09': ""We don't often think of flags as weapons, but like the Confederate battle flag, the Germans used their flag to make an out-group feel unwelcome and less than. You see, when you create a flag, you immediately do two things: you create an in-group, a group that's meant to be represented by the symbol, but then, inevitably, you create an out-group. And usually, that's subtle. It's a byproduct. It's usually not the intent. But the Germans were very clear as to who was represented by the swastika and who was not."", '07:44': ""In 1935, Jewish people were banned from flying German flags. And in this way, the Germans, maybe more than any other time in history, used the dual power of flags to unite but also to divide. Flags were used as identity weapons. And now, in 2019, the Nazi flag is banned from being flown by anyone in Germany and anyone in Austria, in Hungary, in Russia and in Ukraine. Think about that. It's a piece of cloth, but it's banned. On its face, that sounds crazy. But I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that it's probably good. Sounds a lot like a weapon."", '08:30': 'As a vexillologist, sometimes the most interesting thing about a flag is not so much its design, but it\'s those laws around the flag. For instance, in India, to create an Indian flag, you must use a hand-spun cloth named ""khadi."" If you make a flag out of anything else, you could go to jail for up to three years. It\'s crazy. Here in Texas, we\'ve all heard that the Texas flag is the only state flag that can fly at the same height as the US, flag, right? Because we were a nation before we were a state. Who here has heard that? Yeah. Well, I\'m here to tell you that is completely false. OK? First of all, we were not the only state that was a nation before joining up. And secondly, all state flags can fly at the same height as the US flag according to the US flag code.', '09:26': ""And I don't have to ask you how you feel about this one, right? Most of us grew up pledging allegiance to this every morning, knowing we should never let it touch the ground, etc. We take our flag code very seriously here in the United States."", '09:41': 'You remember, recently some NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. It was a big controversy. They were breaking the flag code. It states during the national anthem, stand at attention, hand at the heart, etc. But what was fascinating to me as a vexillologist is that I didn\'t see anyone getting upset when something like this happens. The flag code says, ""The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free."" So sometimes during the exact same national anthem, this was being done, and no one\'s upset. Or this. This happens all the time. The flag code is clear: ""No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or on an athletic uniform."" This is Texas A&amp;M baseball, not to get them in trouble, but this happens all the time, especially in November. I\'m sure, I can almost guarantee when you leave here tonight, you will see on the back of someone\'s car or truck a black and white American flag with a blue stripe, a thin blue line, right? Blue Lives Matter. That breaks the flag code in multiple ways.', '10:43': 'But all of these things are done with the best intent. No one\'s here to argue that. But of course they break a section of the flag code titled ""Respect for the Flag,"" so by putting this on your uniform, you are legally disrespecting the flag. And what I find interesting is that those NFL players kneeling during the anthem and the people who would put Blue Lives Matters stickers on their car are both on the opposite end of a very big issue, but they\'re both breaking the exact same law, a law that is 100 percent unenforceable. In fact, it was Dread Scott\'s piece of art in 1989 that led the Supreme Court to rule that the flag code is just a guideline. You cannot be prosecuted for breaking the flag code. You cannot be forced to be patriotic.', '11:36': ""So why, then, have all of these little laws around how we use our flag if you can't enforce them? And that's because a nation is a fragile collective idea. It only exists in our minds. Can I see this? Thank you. Sometimes a flag is the only tangible symbol of that idea. Right? Our unity is sometimes only held together by literal threads. And that's powerful. The flag code is meant to preserve and protect that fragile idea, while also protecting your right to break it. And that's what's special about the United States, right?"", '12:22': ""And that's what's unique about our flag. Our flag is amazing. It has changed more than any other flag in the world. It's the flag code that says when a new state is created, a star shall be added to the union of the flag, and such addition shall take place on the fourth day of July. Our flag is unique because it is meant to grow as we grow. By design and by law, it is meant to change with us. It's a living symbol of our individuality, our diversity in the stars and our unity. We have a gift in the United States to have a flag that is inclusive. If the Nazi flag was an identity weapon, the United States flag, by design alone, stands in direct contrast. And I have to say, as a vexillologist in 2019, using this flag as an identity weapon against anyone disrespects it far more than letting it touch the ground or any one of the other little laws that we break every day. Right?"", '13:30': 'This flag is a symbol of our unity. We should never use this as a weapon against someone else. I resonate so deeply with the person who wrote in Dread Scott\'s journal, ""We should never value the symbol over the thing that it symbolizes. We should never value a piece of cloth over a human life."" And if you\'re ever going to use a piece of cloth as a weapon, you should never use this one, not when it has always had room for more stars.', '14:01': ""Hopefully by now, you've felt the power of flags, and you can see what they can do. So what if we harnessed that power, and we used it to fight for something greater? This is the flag of Earth, designed by Oskar Pernefeldt of Sweden. Just imagine with me for a second: What if we celebrated our humanity as much if not more than we celebrate our nationalities? As we become a spacefaring civilization and we go off into the stars, what do our nations mean anyway when you're standing on the surface of Mars or any other planet? And then of course, back here on Earth, as our planet is facing a climate crisis, as our climate could be unlivable in our children or grandchildren's lifetime, I believe we need a strong symbol, a flag, to unite us to fight, not just as nations, but as a species."", '15:05': 'Thank you.', '15:07': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the last artifact— the Node of Memory— is suspended within a force field and powering a supercomputer.', '00:58': 'Ethic is about to deactivate the force field when Lemma stops her. She explains, a decade ago, she was assigned a research task: to use the world machine to create something that would make everyone happy. After many failed attempts, Lemma discovered a compound that, when ingested, made people motivated, happy, creative, loving… in short, their best selves. It was rushed into production. Soon, the entire nation’s food supply came from Huxenborg, with the compound mixed in. The first year was paradise. The second, not so much. Side-effects began to emerge: memory-loss, listlessness, and self-absorption. In the third year, the government dissolved, leaving the robots running everything in a self-sustaining loop. By this point things were too far gone for Lemma to reverse. People had become dependent on the compound, and the few who refused it formed a resistance to try to fix things. It took 10 years for Lemma to find a cure. This factory contains everything she’ll need to make it, but the second they take the Node of Memory, the security system will alert the robots, and they’ll have to run. If, instead, they first reconfigure the factory to manufacture the cure, the people can be saved.', '02:22': 'Lemma has the whole factory redesign planned out. The problem is… it’s a little hard to read. Her schematic shows all the steps in the manufacturing process needed to make the cure. An arrow from “add nitric acid” to “shake vigorously” means that the acid addition has to happen before shaking. If a single step is performed out of order, the cure won’t work, or worse. There aren’t any circular references, where step A requires step B and step B eventually requires step A.', '03:10': 'Here’s where Ethic and Hedge come in. Lemma needs Hedge to translate the tangled diagram into a sequence of steps. That’ll be the order that things happen in the factory. Once input into the central computer, the factory will reassemble itself as instructed.', '03:28': 'Hedge’s ability to store information in a table will help here. So how does Ethic program Hedge to turn out a correct sequence that can reconfigure the factory?', '03:38': 'Pause now to figure it out yourself. Rules in 3 Rules in 2 Rules in 1', '03:45': 'Hint in 3 Hint in 2 Hint in 1', '03:48': 'It may help to first think about this problem as a human, rather than a machine. Given this diagram, it’s clear to start with getting a bowl, since no arrows point to it. How might you mark up the diagram to figure out what to do next?', '04:05': 'Pause now to figure it out yourself. Solution in 3 Solution in 2 Solution in 1', '04:10': 'Diagrams like the one Lemma has drawn are called directed acyclic graphs. A graph is a representation of data that shows different elements and how they’re related to each other. Directed means that direction matters— as indicated by the arrows. Here A leads to B, but B doesn’t lead to A. And acyclic means that there aren’t any loops. Which is fortunate, because if there were, this problem wouldn’t be solvable.', '04:42': 'There’s a simple way to navigate the graph as a human: start with a step that doesn’t have any arrows pointing to it. Once you do that, cross out that step and all arrows leading from it. Choose another step with no arrows pointing to it, and repeat until you’ve hit every step.', '05:01': 'There are two things here that are tricky to translate for a robot. First, how do you keep track of the information? And second, what do you do if there are multiple options at the same time?', '05:13': 'For the first challenge, a convenient way for machines to store information is in a table. In this case, you can have Hedge list every step in the headers of both the rows and columns. Then he can go through the rows one at a time. On the schematic, what points to mix? Both shake and titrate. So Hedge should make a mark in both of their columns. He can do the same for every row, one at a time, to make a table like this. Of course the full table will be much bigger.', '05:46': 'Like a human, Hedge will also want to start from one of the steps that has no arrows pointing to it— which is the same as having no marks in its row. If there’s more than one, a convenient way to choose is to pick the one that’s alphabetically earliest, though other selection methods can work just as well.', '06:06': 'Next, Hedge can add that step to his running-order list, delete its entire column from the table— thus removing all the times it was a dependency–– and loop back to the start. Because there are no circular references in the graph, each time we get here there’ll be at least one step with no remaining dependencies. Hedge can add the alphabetically earliest to his running-order list, remove it from the table, and loop back to the start again.', '06:37': 'So now we have a working loop, and it’ll run through all the elements in our table until none are left.', '06:44': 'Hedge drifts back and forth over the schematics, and soon he starts spitting out instructions, which Ethic uses to configure the assembly lines. With the three working together, they churn out thousands of doses of the cure in no time. Ethic finally plucks the Node of Memory from its holding field and trips the alarm. Within seconds bots are everywhere.', '08:08': 'As Ethic falls in shock, the Node restores not only her own memories, but reveals the last, missing pieces of the puzzle.', '08:17': 'Ethic built Hedge with a singular purpose: to construct a maze that would protect the world machine from a corrupt government. But in her haste, she made a critical mistake. She forgot to set the condition that would end the loop which told Hedge how large the maze should be. So Hedge built and built until he could build no longer.', '08:39': 'And then he was conflicted. He had to build a maze. But he couldn’t build further without hurting people or flying over the Bradbarrier, both forbidden by his programming. So he wandered the land and searched for a solution, until he happened upon the Node of Power, the Node of Creation, and the Node of Memory. He recognized their true, collective power to grant self-awareness to those who lack it. With all three he’d be able to change his programming and fulfill his drive to transform the entire world into a giant maze. It wouldn’t be easy: the Nodes had safeguards to prevent robots from taking and using them. But if Hedge could find the right human and manipulate her with the promise of a heroic quest… well that would be a different story.

Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn\'t actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that\'s a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it\'s warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there\'s a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth\'s spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that\'s older than rocks, that\'s older than the Earth itself.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this eye-opening talk, animal advocate and social scientist Jacy Reese makes a compelling argument as to why (and how) we should relegate the factory farming of animals to history's scrap pile.",,,141001,2018-03-14T14:49:48+00:00,"['global issues', 'science', 'food', 'health', 'animals', 'agriculture']","['English', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands']",Jacy Reese,,"{'0:00': 'one we can tackle with the tools of Effective Altruism ... their growing mindset in charity, business and politics of using evidence-based research to find and implement the most effective solutions to the world\'s biggest problems. The most powerful tool we have is innovation. The amazing thing is that we don\'t have to give up meat, dairy, or eggs to end animal farming. Think about it: what\'s meat? It\'s fat, protein, water and trace minerals. All these ingredients are readily available in the plant kingdom. They\'re just not assembled in the architecture of meat. That\'s what a cow does. But a cow also does a lot of stuff we don\'t need. She grows hair, teeth, bones. She walks around; she breathes, thinks, and feels. These extra processes mean that for every 10 calories of plant-based food we feed a farmed animal, we get around 1 calorie of meat in return. Even with the nutrient animal products are most known for, protein, for every 10 grams of plant-based, we get, at most, 2 grams of animal-based. So what if we assembled these ingredients ourselves with a more efficient, ethical process? That\'s the approach of companies like Beyond Meat, Hungry Planet, and Impossible Foods. They\'ve already succeeded in making a beef burger made from plants. Many consumers can\'t even tell the difference. Today, they\'re just perfecting that product and scaling up the process to lower costs and widen distribution. In fact, the Beyond Burger pictured here is already available in Mississippi. But let\'s be cautious. What if consumers are really picky? What if they don\'t just want something that tastes like animal meat, but something that is actually made from animal cells? Well, there\'s good news. Scientists and chefs have been working on so-called clean meat, real meat made without the food safety and ethical cost of animal slaughter. To do this, they take a small sample of cells from a living animal and place those cells in a cultivator, which looks like one of the big tanks at a beer brewery. Inside, the cells mix with the nutrients they need to grow in the same process that happens inside an animal\'s body, and voila! You can have your cow and eat beef too. (Laughter) But you might be thinking, ""Not all beneficial technologies are widely adopted, right? So what if something goes wrong? What if the technology is fully developed, but perceived as just another food for vegetarians? Or what if an irresponsible company lets their product get contaminated, leading to a cascade of negative press that cripples the industry?"" With conventional meat, we see contamination scandals all the time, but for a young industry like clean meat, it could be fatal. It\'s like self-driving cars, where the industry needs to be especially careful about collisions, despite having an overall better safety record. So what social change will we see on our way to an animal-free food system? The biggest one is a shift beyond the individual and towards institutional change. Like I said earlier, advocates have thus far focused heavily on one-by-one diet change, but I believe we\'ll see the biggest changes happen with changes to institutions like businesses, government, nonprofits and society as a whole. There\'s a lot of evidence that this strategy is more effective. Last year, I was at a protest, calling for a restaurant chain to reform its animal-welfare policies, just basic stuff, like choosing healthier breeds of chickens, or having windows in the chicken sheds. A pedestrian walked up and thanked me profusely for helping these poor animals. I told him he was welcome to join us, as bystanders sometimes do, and he said, ""Oh no, no, no. I can\'t. I\'m not a vegetarian."" I insisted that he was welcome to join us without being vegetarian. We were just calling for better treatment for these animals. But he was unconvinced. He saw vegetarianism as a prerequisite to helping farmed animals because advocates have conflated the two for so long. If we had, instead, used an institutional framing, that bystander might have joined us and maybe become vegetarian along the way. This strategy also helps people avoid what psychologists call ""the collapse of compassion,"" the feeling of apathy that comes when we encounter a big problem without clearly seeing the big solution. The institutional framing puts that solution, changing society as a whole, front and center in our messaging. This strategy is also well-evidenced by historical social movements, which is what I spend most of my time researching. Virtually no movements - from environmentalism, children\'s rights, antislavery, feminism to antiwar movements - have succeeded with the heavy, individual focus that we see in the farmed-animal movement. Consumer advocacy like boycotts have succeeded when used as tools for institutional change, but failed when treated as an end goal. We need to learn from the past. The second big change is a shift beyond opposition to factory farming alone and towards opposition to animal farming as whole. There\'s a lot of evidence for this strategy too. First, numerous investigations have shown that so-called humane farms are rarely humane in practice. The most picturesque farm I\'ve ever been on was an award-winning California egg farm. But because of the farm\'s natural and organic policies, they didn\'t vaccinate the birds or give them antibiotics, like factory farms do. This led to atrocious health. I saw many cases of Marek\'s, a highly contagious disease that often leads to blindness and missing eyes; fluid belly, some birds with over a pound of fluid buildup inside their less than five-pound bodies; fungal infections; lice on almost all of them; and many birds crippled by eggs that had gotten stuck inside them on the way out. I\'ve been dismayed that the reality of these farms is nearly as bad as factory farming. While reduction in suffering is something we should applaud, and it can be a step towards abolition, the unmitigated suffering is still a moral catastrophe. Second, simply the idea that there are humane ways to raise and kill animals for food is a huge roadblock, even if you just oppose factory farming. Seventy-five percent of people think they usually eat meat from animals who were treated humanely, but as we saw earlier, less than 1% of farmed animals actually live on non-factory farms. That\'s crazy, right? Why are consumers so confused? Well, when we eat animals, there\'s a cognitive dissonance that claws at us because deep down, we care about animals too. What seems to happen is that our subconscious protects us from this dissonance by creating a psychological refuge. It tells us that, actually, everything is okay, that farmed animals are treated well, even when the facts point in the opposite direction. This mistaken belief protects us from the conflict between our values and our behavior. And the misleading labels on animal products, like pictures of green pastures on cartons of factory farm eggs, exacerbate this issue. Finally, these farms are just too expensive to feed this hungry planet. So-called humane animal products are already several times the normal price. Many of us just can\'t afford that. And the demand on natural resources is just too much for this planet to bear, especially when we can get the same foods from more sustainable sources. Fortunately, the future is bright. Today, we\'re at an inflection point, where the moral reasons to change our food system are very compelling. Technology is on its way and excellent alternatives are already here, and advocates are wising up to more impactful strategies. It\'s incredibly empowering to have this wealth of evidence available, from history, psychology and elsewhere, to analyze using the effective altruism perspective. Ultimately, that evidence suggests that we can achieve a truly humane food system if we strive towards the end of animal farming. And public opinion is already a lot further along on this than you might think. Forty-seven percent of US adults already say they support a ban on slaughter houses. As we transition, as we align our food system with our values, we\'re going to see a sweeping change in the relationship between humans and the other inhabitants of this planet. Once we\'re no longer eating animals three times a day, we\'ll see a huge relief in cognitive dissonance that frees our conscience to expand our moral circle to not just farmed animals, but other populations like dogs and cats in shelters, animals used in circuses and entertainment, and the vast number of wild animals who also need our help. Today, we\'re laying the foundation for future social movements just as social movements of the past laid the bedrock we now stand on. Richard Branson predicted that the food system will be animal-free in just 30 years. It might take a little longer than that, but it\'s clear that huge change is coming. You can stand on the right side of history and play a role in this exciting movement, whether it\'s by starting a business like a local restaurant or a clean-meat company, becoming an activist, making a donation, or simply sharing content on social media. You can, of course, also participate as a conscious consumer, but keep in mind that your own diet choice is just one of many ways to have an impact. This is a time of unbridled excitement and opportunity, as we look ahead at one of the next great social movements. Humanity\'s moral circle will continue to expand, but only if people like you and me take hold. Thank you.

Euclid is known as the author of a singularly influential work known as ""Elements."" You think your math book is long? Euclid\'s ""Elements"" is 13 volumes full of just geometry. In ""Elements,"" Euclid structured and supplemented the work of many mathematicians that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions, and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however, is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded in a very convoluted way. Euclid\'s version states that, ""If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel."" Wow, that is a mouthful! Here\'s the simpler, more familiar version: ""In a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that\'s parallel to the original one."" Many mathematicians over the centuries tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four, but weren\'t able to do so. In the process, they began looking at what would happen logically if the fifth postulate were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss, and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known as non-Euclidean geometries. We\'ll leave the details of these different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us the entire story in ""Elements,"" and merely described one possible way to look at the universe. It all depends on the context of what you\'re looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether Euclid had any inkling of the existence of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it\'s hard to believe he had no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him to flush out the details. If so, he\'s probably pleased. These discoveries could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside of what they\'ve been taught. We, too, must be willing at times to put aside our preconceived notions and physical experiences and look at the larger picture, or we risk not seeing the rest of the story.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And you know, before we dive into the future of climate action in Chile and beyond, I think it would be great for us to talk about the present and why Chile really represents a country that is worth thinking about when we talk about climate. You know, recently there have been lots of commendable actions taken by your country when we think about climate. Chile recently committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, the first in the Americas to do this, and that's especially notable when you think about how much of Chile's economy really depends on carbon emissions: mining and agriculture and spaces like that. So could you start a little bit by just talking about how would this even be possible to get to net-zero emissions in 30 years, and what would that mean for Chile?"", '01:11': ""MM: Mm-hmm. It was a very surreal image when we saw Minister Schmidt, the COP25 president, Patricia Espinosa, the UN head on climate change, with masks, delivering this new NDC. The important thing here is, things that are hard to build require consensus, but therefore to get rid of that commitment, you need to have another consensus. This hasn't happened, so the thing is, the reason why Chile has a sort of vision towards mitigation that's ambitious is that we see that there's a big economic benefit. We have seen, we've witnessed, what the renewable energy sector has been able to do for investment, for lowering energy costs. And so therefore to reach this goal, we will inevitably expand to 100 percent renewable, but we'll also transform our industry, which is heavy on fossil fuels, towards low emissions, with the hydrogen economy kicking in, with a recently launched committee that I formed, that Minister Jobet, the Minister of Energy, set up. And also energy efficiency and a lot of capture, carbon capture. We are endowed with a lot of natural capital. Taking care of that natural capital and expanding plantations will allow us to reach net-zero by 2050."", '02:28': ""WPR: That's great.

Could you talk a little bit, I guess, about the history of how Chile arrived at this moment?"", '02:44': ""MM: Yeah, so in 2011, 2010, we had an energy discussion with incumbents saying the only way we could solve our energy problems will be through large coal and large hydro in the Patagonia. And that really polarized the discussion. We got together as a community after large protests that triggered a lot of social movements, and we started discussing how we should be able to do our energy going forward. The population, public unrest, set up almost 6,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants to never be built. And when the government, Michelle Bachelet's government came in, we pulled the plug on the HidroAysén project, which is a big hydro project in the Patagonia. And both of these conditions enabled an opportunity for renewable energy to set in. We put in carbon taxes, we put in environmental regulations, and we set up an energy strategy that we did, building on discussing and looking at the data, in which we thought that the 70 percent renewable energy by 2050 was going to be a target that we could agree on. This target has been long surpassed. Now we're thinking of reaching that same goal by 2030."", '03:57': ""WPR: And what you were saying about social protests, that's something that a lot of people maybe have been following news of what's going in Chile are familiar with recent social protests, and I think I'm curious about how you see that factoring in to climate action moving forward. How might these social protests play a role in what climate action you see? And, really, how is it possible for Chile to be a leader in climate action while also struggling with some of these social issues?"", '04:28': ""MM: Well, the social issues, which are very profound and important to address, caused, for example, COP25 to not be able to be held in Santiago and to go to Madrid. And this also shifted a whole bunch of the discussions and announcements that weren't done and we were expecting to have. But regardless of this, the fact that we have this commitment from the government today shows that there's a resolution to continue forward. But really, the economic model of Chile was brought into question, because the environmental issues, for example, are quite widespread, and many times you have large coal-fired power plants being situated where people live and with higher mortality rates. Somebody who lives where a power plant is installed has twice the rate of death in comparison to other people in Chile. So the model of having many people be impacted for the benefit of few is something that caused and triggered the social unrest. And it goes into the economic model itself of extracting, polluting, impacting communities that may not see the benefits of these economic activities. So while we've done a lot -- we've come a long way, for example, in securing a very emblematic agreement to phase out coal-fired power plants -- many people feel that this wasn't done fast enough and want this action to be brought faster."", '05:54': 'WPR: And it sounds like having people be the voice and the engine behind making that happen has really been part of this historical thread with climate action in Chile and seems like it would really lead things moving into the future.', '06:11': 'MM: No, definitely, and we will continue.

I think, for example, the mining sector has a great opportunity to be the solution for the environmental issues, because we provide the copper, the cobalt, the lithium that are required for solar PV panels, for battery storage. But we need to do this in a clean manner. I think that's the biggest challenge we're going to have in the next 20 years ahead."", '06:55': ""WPR: And sort of pivoting to the pandemic and to thinking about what's going on right now, the entire world has obviously been devastated by this crisis. What have been some of the unique challenges that Chile has faced during this pandemic?"", '07:10': ""MM: Well, definitely, as anybody, we are always struggling within taking actions today to prevent a deeper impact in the future. And we started off pretty well. We shut off schools. We shut off different cities and had a quarantine. But we gave the wrong signals to people and we didn't have a consistent effort, and this has brought us to have the highest infection rates per capita in the world these days. So this goes to show that -- the same parallels with climate change. We need to take action now to prevent deeper impact later. And I think we need to take the lesson of this to continue with an effort, because one thing is to announce an ambitious NDC. Another thing is to invest and do the regulations that you require to turn this into reality. But there are some things that are interesting. The pollution in Santiago, which is one of the most polluted capitals historically in Latin America, has dropped substantially. The car-related emissions are down almost 80 to 90 percent, which is pretty substantive. And we look at the example of what's going on. Harvard University showed a study in which they showed higher mortality rates for more polluted cities. And this is also the case in Chile. For every microgram of pollution, PM2.5, there is an increase of the fatality rate of nine percent. But the thing is, we could also look back at what we've achieved up to now. Had we not taken measures to clean the air, as we've done in Chile these last 20 years, we would be talking about five times more people would have died from COVID. We have around 800 people that have died due to COVID directly, but this would have been much higher had we not taken action. And in fact, due to the lower pollution, if we estimate and predict this to the rest of the year, we will have saved as many lives reducing the pollution as we have lost in COVID, showing that there's a pandemic that we also need to address, which is the crisis on air pollution that suffocates many cities in the world."", '09:11': ""WPR: And it seems like that's probably something that we're seeing in other areas around the world. As you're suggesting, air pollution is a problem everywhere. And I'm curious also how these challenges that you've mentioned, and maybe others, might hinder or help some of this progress that you're hoping to make towards climate action. How do you see this factoring in to some of the decisions that might be made going forward in Chile and beyond?"", '09:40': ""MM: OK, so we have a higher fatality rate and more polluted cities, and we have a climate action to carry out. This is going to be a decisive decade, in which we need to lay the groundwork for our lower-emissions strategies. So whatever we do today cannot lock us in to an incompatible climate future. We need to lay the groundwork for this low-emissions transition. So therefore, our green recovery efforts need to be done, as Kristalina [Georgieva] spoke last week, has to be related to a green recovery that creates jobs immediately, that addresses the poverty issues that we have on energy today in southern Chile, and we need to use this for expanding renewable energy and expanding the successful efforts that we've done on electromobility. Today, we have the largest fleet of electric buses outside of China, but we could actually make this go even bigger, because we've seen that the reductions in cost have been almost 70 percent in comparison to diesel buses. So we should use this opportunity to expand."", '10:40': ""And multiple stakeholders are working. We're working together to call on the government to do a green recovery, to use the green bonds that we've already issued and under which we've gotten really low rates for interest rates, to do and fund cleaning the air, cleaning the transportation and laying the groundwork for a cleaner tomorrow in the mining sector, which is our biggest challenge going forward."", '11:07': ""WPR: And then as far as the way that you think about and conceptualize climate action, have you personally had any changes to your thinking, just as a result of what you're seeing through this pandemic?"", '11:21': ""MM: Yeah, I think we start looking around, everybody had to struggle and find that we could do much more with less, and keeping a full economy that requires you to buy an extra t-shirt that you don't need, the fact that we're using three times more clothes than we were maybe 20 years ago shows that we are blowing up an economy that requires us to destroy the environment, in a way, to continue forward. And the food system is going to be probably our biggest challenge, and even though I've been working with electric buses and electromobility and just the more conventional mitigation, I think our biggest cultural challenge will be to talk about how our food decisions impact the way that we will have a future."", '12:12': '""Nature"" just put out a report that showed something that when we were in the government, we had talked about. When Chile was good in soccer, we started going deeper into the wintertime contests, and we started winning games. But to win those games, we started doing a lot of barbecues, and the paper that came out showed something that, when we explained this to people, that you guys are messing up the air with barbecues, people thought we were crazy. Well, the ""Nature"" report now shows that we actually fouled the air and destroyed the air, annihilated the air, because we wanted to celebrate the soccer. And we set this up to people, and people thought we were crazy. Now people acknowledge the fact that the basic things that you could do, such as the way that you choose how to cook, could actually impact your air. So I think going forward these cultural challenges that we need to do, we need to tackle them head-on. We should need to show the evidence. Otherwise, we\'re just going to be ignoring problems and letting them perpetuate for the future.', '13:15': 'WPR: And, you know, for nations who have not really prioritized climate in the same way that Chile has, are there lessons that you think can be learned from some of the choices that Chile has made in recent years that other nations can apply, and how could folks in other countries implement some of these strategies that you implemented in Chile?', '13:36': 'MM: So, many people in the US and across the world know about the Chilean sea bass. The Chilean sea bass was overfished and almost collapsed. One of the things that we did under the support from ""National Geographic"" and with the leadership of President Bachelet was to expand marine protection, from four percent of our oceans to 43 percent within one government, which is the largest leap. There\'s only comparison to the US during Obama in terms of protection. And this is because we want this population also to recover. You know, when you let the park stop fishing, the overflow from the fishing will actually increase the biomass sixfold. So I think one of the efforts that we need to do as we talk about the biodiversity convention that\'s going to happen this next year is that we need to change our relationship to the environment. We need to protect and conserve our ecosystems, so they provide the services that they do today. Today, 96 percent of all mammals, land mammals, are humans or stuff humans eat. Only four percent of land mammals are wild. When I heard that data, from ""National Geographic,"" for the first time, I couldn\'t believe it. We\'ve changed our relationship with the planet, and we\'re suffering these decisions because we see zoonotic diseases -- not just coronavirus -- spread time after time.', '15:00': 'WPR: And we have Bruno here -- hi, Bruno -- with a question from the community.', '15:04': 'Bruno Giussani: Hi. Absolutely. Hello, Marcelo. This is a question from Melissa Mahoney. She asks if you can expand on what economic benefits of net-zero emissions are. And especially, could those benefits be the same for Chile and for other countries?', '15:23': ""MM: Good. For example, when I worked in the World Bank, we supported Chile to look into the macroeconomic impacts of the net-zero target. And it was shown that Chile will grow 4.4 percent more. So we turned the risk of climate change, and we turned it into an opportunity of expanded growth. This manifests in lower transportation costs, lower energy costs, and this makes the economy more competitive. The costs of reaching the net-zero target are much lower than the benefits that we will have to reap. And we're not even talking about cleaner air benefits, we're talking about direct economic benefits of having increased investments, which is something that every country will require in these years to recover from the COVID crisis, and lower energy costs. So that's how it manifests, and this is a consensus today that we need to have more renewable energy because this is the way that we've had cleaner air and lower energy costs."", '16:22': 'BG: There is another question from someone in the audience, asking, ""Countries across Latin America have very different attitudes on climate. Can you comment on that?""', '16:37': ""MM: So Pew Research Center has been putting out reports regarding what is the main external threat that you have. And in Europe, in the US, the biggest threat was either China or ISIS or some external bellicose threat. In Latin America and Africa, it's climate change, number one, and Chile is one of the highest, with 86 percent of Chileans saying that climate change is the greatest external threat. And this is also very high across the region. We could have populist governments coming in, changing their priorities, but the reality is, people are concerned, because they see the threat of climate change every day, and regardless of whether the national government believes in it, climate change is real and is causing impacts and causing poverty in the region."", '17:24': 'BG: Thank you, Marcelo. Back to you, Whitney.', '17:27': 'WPR: Thank you. Thank you, Bruno. And Marcelo, just one last question before we actually say goodbye, which is just, knowing that you were involved in the negotiations for the Paris Agreement, are there things that you take from that experience that you can apply to this moment as we think about emerging from this crisis and coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic?', '17:49': ""MM: Yes, that there will always be a populist that will be opposing climate action, and the way to get at this is to make the economic case, so regardless of what happens, there will be an economic case for spending on renewable energy. The US grew its renewable energy investments around 40 percent last year. In Brazil, it grew almost 10 percent. And so therefore, if we are able to align the economic goals with climate goals, you will be able to make this go forward. There's the Network for Greening the Financial System that puts together central bankers. The World Bank launched a coalition of finance ministers for climate action. These are great efforts that will allow us to have the financial system support climate action because there's an economic benefit, because it's important for you, for your fiduciary responsibilities, to disclose the risks you have, both transitionally and physically. And if we are able to do this, regardless of what negotiations happen, because there will always be problems with the consensus, you will continue to have a resilient approach because climate action will continue because you can have the economic system support this."", '18:59': ""WPR: That's really great. Thank you so much, Marcelo, for being with us to share your perspective and your insight. It's really great to sort of zoom in on some of the things happening in Chile and how that might apply to all of us all over the world. Thank you for joining us today."", '19:13': 'MM: Thanks.'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As with most things I don\'t understand, I work them out in the studio. And so I just started making these portraits of mug shots, starting because I did a Google search for my father, just wondering what had happened over this 15-year period. Where had he gone? And I found his mug shot, which of course was of no surprise.

And if we know that to be true, if we believe that to be true, then the only benevolent thing to do in that context would be to extend that liberty. And so in this body of work, I use two separate paintings that are forced together on top of one another to emphasize this tumultuous relationship between Black and white in these compositions.

And as they stood there with their hands on their weapons, I asked the police officer what was different about my citizenship than that of all of the other people who were not being disturbed in that moment. He informed me that they had been following us for two hours and that they had been getting complaints about Black men, two Black men walking in and out of galleries.

https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_changizi_why_do_we_see_illusions,Why do we see illusions?,"Why can't our extremely complex eyes render simple optical illusions? Surprise, surprise -- it comes back to the brain, which has only evolved to encounter natural stimuli. At TEDYouth 2012, Mark Changizi explains how the brain reckons with optical illusions.[Directed by TED Media].",0:07:17,7.283333333,125303,2019-02-12T22:30:57+00:00,"['consciousness', 'TED-Ed', 'animation', 'illusion', 'sight', 'brain', 'science', 'biology']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Русский', 'Српски, Srpski', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Mark Changizi,Educator,"{'00:21': 'Why do we see illusions? I\'m going to tell you about some of my research, where I provided evidence for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let\'s look at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many, many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I\'m just going to walk through it for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow outwards at their centers. At the center where those radial lines are, it\'s wider in your visual field than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it\'s a remarkably simple stimulus. It\'s just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most complicated objects in the universe be unable to render this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you\'ve been encountering this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails, or blur lines, on your retina. They\'re activating mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version of what happens in real life and this another version of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it\'s not that in real life you see blur lines. The point is that it\'s the stimulus at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that\'s what tells your brain that you\'re moving. When you move forward, your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates, little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates when you\'re moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird optic blur stuff, and it tells you the direction you\'re moving. Alright, that\'s half the story. That\'s what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it\'s looking at the first image, that you\'re actually on your way, moving towards the center. It still doesn\'t explain why you should perceive these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand that our brains are slow. What you would like is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn\'t work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second doesn\'t sound very long, but it\'s a long time in normal behaviors. If you\'re moving just at one meter per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second, you\'ve moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn\'t correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped into it or just passed it. And of course, this is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it\'s going to be much worse in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can\'t passively respond and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess about the next moment. What will the world look like in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you\'ll have a perception of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence -- and there\'s other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I\'ve shown that huge swaths of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines are suggesting that I\'m moving. What happens to them? Well, let\'s imagine. Imagine you\'ve got a doorway. You\'ve got a doorway. Imagine it\'s a cathedral doorway, to make it more concrete -- it\'ll be helpful in a second. When you\'re very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens when you get closer. It all flows outwards in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you\'re really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn\'t go outwards nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that\'s more like this next picture. The projective geometry -- that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this, well, your brain has no problem, there\'s just two vertical lines and no cues that there\'ll be a change in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you\'re going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed perceptions of the future, because they\'re just static images on the page, they\'re not changing like in real life. And let me just end by showing one illusion here. If I can, I\'ll quickly show two. This one\'s fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I\'ve added blur to these optic flow lines, your brain says, ""They\'re probably already moving, that\'s why they\'re blurry."" When you do it, they should be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn\'t be moving that much. And a final one I\'ll just leave in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get on your retina when things are moving. You don\'t have to do anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving when they shouldn\'t be. It\'s weird, right? But what you have now are the cues that, from your brain\'s point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like, ""Oh, these things are moving."" Render a perception of what they\'ll do in the next moment -- they should be moving and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much.

In his tender talk from TEDxKyoto, Hirano suggests that with the help of our loved ones we can begin to honestly and completely love who we are. (In Japanese with English subtitles).",,,121296,2018-07-03T14:35:42+00:00,"['personal growth', 'self', 'relationships', 'love', 'life', 'communication']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', '日本語']",Keiichiro Hirano,Novelist,"{'0:00': 'As I have been recently hearing about disturbing sad news, I often think about the idea of loving yourself. We have been taught to love other people as an important value, but I think loving our own selves hasn\'t been considered to be an issue worth talking about. Why? It may be because it\'s too obvious, that we love ourselves, to take up the issue and stress the importance. All of us can\'t avoid being egoistic, sometimes. We want to have things our own way. If everything in our life is going well, can we love ourselves? Not necessarily so. The reason why it\'s hard to discuss ""self-love"" may be that it has a kind of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people. If we saw somebody looking in the mirror, saying, ""How I love myself! Don\'t bother me!""... I am not talking about myself! We would want to say, ""Suit yourself! Keep looking in the mirror."" I want to say it doesn\'t have to be like that, to love ourselves. Life isn\'t always easy. It would be, of course, nice if we were happy all our life. But in our life, many people might say, ""I hate you,"" or ""I wish you would disappear from this world."" Going through the agony, we ultimately reach the realization that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves. If, when people tell us, ""I hate you,"" we respond to it by saying, ""Yes, I hate myself, too,"" the moment we said so, I\'m sure we would lose our desire to go on living. I\'ve felt the need for that kind of attitude more than once myself. Since we don\'t know what will happen in the future, the kind of situation in which we have to love ourselves might arise again, in the sense of needing to take care of ourselves. It would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life. For a quite long time, I couldn\'t figure out what kind of person I was. When I did something good for others, people showed appreciation to me, and then I thought I was basically a pretty good person. Like that, I had occasions that made me feel relieved. On the other hand, when I would really hurt someone, I was very disappointed in myself, feeling like I was fundamentally a cruel person. To love ourselves actually may be harder than to love any other person, because we know ourselves thoroughly, through and through. Looking back at all we have done in the past, and remembering: ""Boy, I did such things as this and that..."" And not only the good things we\'ve done, but unpleasant things we\'ve done also come back at us. Can we love ourselves with knowing all those sides of us? At this point, I thought, in our thought process, there must be something fundamentally wrong. Then, I started by doing this to change it: First, I honestly looked back at myself, seeing a pretty good person, or one not so good. And for the time being, I accepted all my ""selves,"" good or bad. Instead of being judgmental about myself, thinking ""I may be a nice guy at heart,"" or ""I may be basically a cruel person,"" ""Which one is really me?"" I decided to accept all my ""selves"" as parts of myself, and thought about why I had so many varied ""selves"" in this one person. To sum it up, it\'s in response to different people and different situations. When I talk to my grandmother, I am very relaxed. When I talk to people at work, I may sound serious, putting on a serious look, talking about difficult things. When I talk to somebody who rubs me the wrong way, you can bet the tone of my voice can\'t be this calm. I try not to come into contact with such a person in the first place. In any case, each ""self"" of mine has its own uniqueness. To love each ""self"" of mine equally in order to love myself may be very difficult, but I can say, ""I love my \'self\' when I am with this person. I become somebody whom I even abhor when I am with that person. But I like my \'self\' pretty well when I am with this particular person. I am not too bad."" In fact, to love ourselves may not be that hard after all. Take romance. Suppose there are two girls, and I have feelings toward both of them. One day I have a date with one of them, and have dinner with her. I enjoy being with her, talking a lot, frequently interjecting jokes, smiling at each other, and we interact with each other very well. Then suddenly I notice it\'s the time for the last train. I rush to the train station to catch the last one. And at home, I\'m happy with myself. As for the other girl, I also like her, but during our date, I can\'t talk or joke that much... And we often get awkward silences. I feel like a miserable loser. I don\'t feel like going on with her, so after having dinner, we say goodbye to each other. After the two dates, if I were asked which one I would rather see again, I would choose the first one without hesitation. There\'s no doubt I like her, but rather because I like my ""self"" when I am with her. I enjoy my ""self"" when I am with her, and find life worth living in the life of that ""self"" of mine. The definition of ""love"" may be to love somebody else, this surely is not wrong, but what I would like to add to it is: Rather, to love means, with the help of the person we love, for us to be able to love ourselves. That\'s what I\'d like to think. ""I can reveal my inner self as I wish without any difficulties, being true to myself, when I am with that person, and it will never happen with anybody else."" Unfortunately, some of our relationships come to end. Some end out of disputes. Others end due to death. When we grieve over losing our loved ones, we miss the voice and hug of the person, and many other things, but I wonder if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our ""self"" who lived with that person, thinking: ""Only with them could I talk freely like that. Only with them could I be honest with myself. Only with them could I be silly like that. But that person is gone now, and I can\'t live the life of that \'self\' of mine I love any longer."" I wonder if that is what we really grieve over. And, of course, vice versa. If somebody says to me, ""I love you,"" I will be euphoric, yelling, ""Yes!"" But if I were told, ""Thanks to you, I come to love myself,"" or ""I love myself when I\'m with you more than when I am with anybody else,"" that would be something which strikes my heart more. That my existence validates one person\'s existence that way moves me with a deep joy, something poignant. Each time when we find one ""self"" we love, we may be finding our foothold we need to go on living. In our life, we feel like we need to be loved by many people, a certain percentage of people in our groups, in our class, our workplace. But not that many of those ""selves"" we love may be necessary. If we find two or three of our ""selves"" we love in ourselves, we can go on with those as our foothold. Five or six may be more than enough. You may think you only have 3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends who help you like yourself. All depends on how you take it. To love ourselves doesn\'t mean saying: ""I am crazy about myself,"" looking into a mirror, but, instead, it means, with the help of or via somebody else, for us to come to love ourselves. It\'s probably where we start really loving ourselves. And that is why, as we feel the need, we love others as indispensable individuals. That\'s all I want to say. Thank you.

My family of six crammed into a small, two-bedroom apartment in a three-story walk-up in Brooklyn. The block had several children -- some spoke Spanish, some spoke English. Initially, I wasn\'t allowed to play with them because, as my parents said, ""Them too rambunctious"" --', '00:31': '(Laughter)', '00:32': 'so I could only watch them from my window. Rollerskating was one of their favorite activities. They loved hitching a ride at the back of the city bus, letting go of the rear bumper as the bus arrived at the bottom of the block in front of my building. One day there was a new girl with them. I heard the usual squeals of laughter interspersed with, ""Mira, mira! Mira, mira!"" Spanish for, ""Look, look!"" The group grabbed onto the back of the bus at the top of the block, and as they rolled down laughing and screaming, ""Mira, mira, mira, mira,"" the bus abruptly stopped. The experienced riders adjusted and quickly let go, but the new girl lurched back and fell onto the pavement. She didn\'t move.', '01:18': 'The adults outside ran to help her. The bus driver came out to see what had happened and call for an ambulance. There was blood coming from her head. She didn\'t open her eyes. We waited for the ambulance, and waited, and everyone said, ""Where is the ambulance? Where is the ambulance?"" The police finally arrived. An older black American man said, ""Ain\'t no ambulance coming."" He said it again loudly to the cop. ""You know ain\'t no ambulance coming. They never send no ambulance here."" The cop looked at my neighbors who were getting frustrated, lifted the girl into the patrol car and left.', '01:57': ""I was 10 years old at the time. I knew this wasn't right. I knew there was something more we could do. The something I could do was become a doctor. I became an internist and committed my career to caring for those we often call the underserved, the vulnerable, like those neighbors I had when I first immigrated to America."", '02:18': ""During my early training years in Harlem in the '80s, I saw a shocking increase in young men with HIV. Then when I moved [to] Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily, poor black and brown people. Within a few years, an infection seen in a select population became a worldwide epidemic. Again I got the urge to do something. Fortunately, with the help of activists and advocates and educators and physicians like me who treat the disease, we found a way forward. There was a massive education effort to reduce HIV transmission and provide legal protection for those with the disease. There was a political will to make sure that as many patients as possible worldwide, regardless of ability to pay, could get access to medication. Within a couple of decades there were new treatments that transformed this life-threatening infection to a chronic disease, like diabetes. Now there's a vaccine on the horizon."", '03:25': 'Over the last five to seven years, I\'ve noticed a different epidemic among the patients in Florida, and it looks something like this. Ms. Anna Mae, a retired clerical worker living on a fixed income in Opa-locka, walked in for medication refills. She had common chronic conditions of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and asthma with overlapping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- COPD. Ms. Anna Mae was one of my more adherent patients, so I was surprised she needed refills of her breathing medicines earlier than usual. Towards the end of the visit, she handed me a Florida Power and Light form and asked me to sign it. She was behind on her light bill. This form allowed physicians to document serious medical conditions requiring equipment that would be impacted if the patient\'s electricity was disconnected. ""But Ms. Anna Mae,"" I said, ""you don\'t use any medical devices for breathing. I don\'t think you qualify."" Further questioning revealed she had been using her air conditioner day and night because of the heat so she could breathe. Needing to buy more asthma inhalers left her little money; she couldn\'t pay all the bills so it piled up. I filled out the form, but knowing she might be denied, I also sent her to the social worker.', '04:44': 'Then there was Jorge, such a sweet, kind man who often gifted our clinic with some of the fruits he sold on the streets of Miami. He had signs of worsening kidney function whenever he worked days on end on those hot streets due to dehydration -- just not enough blood getting to the kidneys. His kidneys worked much better whenever he took some days off. But with no other support, what could he do? As he says, ""Rain or shine, cold or heat, I have to work.""', '05:16': 'But the most damning case of all may be Ms. Sandra Faye Twiggs of Fort Lauderdale with COPD.

That's when richer people move into poorer neighborhoods that are at higher elevation and less subject to flood damage from climate change.

Directly, through heat, extreme weather and pollution; through the spread of the disease; through disruption of our food and water supply; and through disruption of our emotional well-being.

There [it] was thanks to the activism of patients with HIV that demanded medications and better research, and the collaboration of doctors and scientists that we were able to control the epidemic. And then it was thanks to international health agencies, NGOs, politicians and pharmaceutical companies that HIV medication became available in low-income countries. There is no reason we can't also apply this model of collaboration to address the health effects of climate change before it's too late."", '08:46': ""Climate change is here. It's already damaging the health and homes of poor people. Like my patient Jorge, most of us will have to work, whether rain or shine, cold or heat. But together these patients and their doctors, hand-in-hand, with some basic tools, can do so much to make this climate transition less brutal for all of us."", '09:09': ""These patients inspired me to found a clinicians' organization to fight climate change. We focus on understanding the health effects of climate change, learning to advocate for patients with climate-related illnesses and encouraging real-world solutions."", '09:25': 'A recent Gallup study showed three of the most respected professions are nurses, doctors and pharmacists. So as respected members of society, we have amplified voices to influence climate change policy and politics. There is so much we can do. As clinicians, our many patient contacts allows us to see things before others. And this puts us in an ideal position to be on the frontlines of change.', '09:51': ""We can teach climate-related illnesses in our health-professional schools. We can collect data on our patients' climate-related conditions by making sure there are billing codes to identify them. We can do climate-related health research. We can teach how to have green practices in homes. We can advocate for our patient energy needs. We can help them get safer homes. We can help them get necessary equipment in those homes when conditions worsen. We can testify in front of lawmakers as to the findings, and we can medically treat our patients' climate-related illnesses. Most importantly, we can help prepare our patients mentally and physically for the health challenges they will face, using a model of medicine that incorporates economic and social justice."", '10:40': 'This would mean Ms. Sandra Faye Twiggs with COPD, who died after being released from jail after a fight with her daughter over a fan, would have known that the heat in her apartment made her sick and angry and seek a safer place to go for cooling. Even better, her apartment would never have been so hot.', '11:01': 'From the poor, I\'ve learned our lives are not only vulnerable but are stories of resilience, innovation and survival. Like that wise old man who loudly spoke truth to the cop that summer night: ""Ain\'t no ambulance coming,"" and compelled him to deliver that little girl to the hospital instead.', '11:21': ""You know what? Listen up. If there's going to be a medical response to climate change, it is not going to be just waiting for an ambulance. It is going to happen because we the clinicians take the first step.

I hear you say, ""Totally logical.""', '01:50': ""But how about another aspect of the community? The disabled community. Do we find them well-represented in the great orchestras of our world? Well, I can tell you as a conductor, I work with orchestras around the world all the time, and I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of disabled musicians I've encountered in any orchestra, anywhere. Why is this? You can't tell me that there aren't millions upon millions of prodigiously gifted musicians of disability around the world. Where is their platform? Where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them so that they can collaborate with other great musicians?"", '02:36': ""So, ladies and gentlemen, as you can probably tell, I'm on a bit of a mission. And this mission has a personal root to it. I have four children, the youngest of whom was born with cerebral palsy. She's now five, and through her glorious existence, I suppose I have now become a fully paid-up member of the amazing, dizzyingly wonderful disabled community. And I find myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking what an incredible model that is. It's taken a good five decades, actually, but I can say with hand on heart that when the Paralympics comes to London next year, there will not be an intelligent person anywhere on the planet who does not absolutely believe in the validity of disabled sportspeople. What an amazing position to be in!"", '03:22': 'So, ladies and gentlemen, where the hell is music in all this? Apologies to any of you who are sports fans, but music is far more universal than sport. Where is the platform? Where is their voice? So, we in the UK are at the very early stages in forming what will be Britain\'s first-ever national disabled orchestra. We are going to call it the British Paraorchestra, because with the world\'s eyes on London next year and particularly on the Paralympics, we want to throw down the gauntlet to every single other country that is represented there, to say to them, ""Here\'s our paraorchestra. Where\'s yours?"" Every country should have a multiplicity of paraorchestras of all shapes and sizes, no question.', '04:09': ""Now, today is a very special day for me, because it is the first time that the first four members of my little embryonic paraorchestra are going to play in public; four extraordinary musicians of which the number will grow and grow. I hope in the end the Paraorchestra could even be as big as 50 musicians. We present to you today a little sonic adventure, a little piece of improvisational whimsy, if you like, a piece on which, of course, the ink is still wet, the clay is still wet. After all, improvisation is never a fixed thing. We decided what we wanted to share with you, at the heart of our improvisation, was a tune which is beloved of British people. It's one of the only folk melodies that we still recognize in our culture. And here's an interesting thing: folk music can tell you an awful lot about the cultural DNA of the country from which it originates. You see, we in Britain are quietly melancholic. You know, the rain ... it does rain. The food's not so good."", '05:09': '(Laughter)', '05:10': 'Quietly melancholic. Not blackly so, just quietly so. And as Shakespeare put it so brilliantly in ""Twelfth Night,"" he loves music that has ""a dying fall.""', '05:22': 'So this melody, ""Greensleeves,"" is chock-full of ""dying fall."" You may know this tune.', '05:28': '(Singing) Da, da, da da da da, dying fall.', '05:31': '(Laughter)', '05:32': 'Da da da, da da da da, dying fall.', '05:34': 'Da dee, da da na na ... dying fall ... na na nee, na ah ah ah ah.', '05:38': 'Brief burst of sunshine, ladies and gentlemen, the chorus --', '05:41': '(Singing) Ya da da da, dying fall ...', '05:43': '(Laughter)', '05:44': '(Singing) Da da dee, da da da da, dying fall ...', '05:47': 'Ya da da da, dying fall ...', '05:50': ""OK? It's like we need some melodic Viagra in our culture, ladies and gentlemen."", '05:55': '(Laughter)', '05:57': '(Applause)', '06:03': ""It goes without saying that we are very much at the starting gates with this project. We need your help, we need the global community to help us deliver this dream, so that this orchestra can be full steam ahead by summer 2012. If you think there's any way that you can help us, please, please, get in touch."", '06:23': 'And so, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me enormous pride, pleasure and joy to introduce to you, with a short improvisation upon that most melancholic tune, ""Greensleeves,"" the first four members of the British Paraorchestra.', '06:37': '(Applause) (Cheers)', '06:48': '(Music)', '13:01': '(Applause)', '13:11': '(Cheers) (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historian Keith Lowe thinks the answer lies in what we choose to remember and what we choose to forget about history. In his talk, Lowe describes the grey areas of an epochal event often considered in black and white terms, and argues that we need to challenge our assumptions to avoid repeating historical mistakes.",,,107704,2019-03-01T20:29:13+00:00,"['war', 'history', 'society', 'future', 'global issues']","['English', 'Português de Portugal', 'Српски, Srpski']",,,"{'0:00': 'Hello everybody. Audience: Hello. Keith Lowe: Fantastic! This is like a schoolroom or something. (Laughter) My name is Keith Lowe. I am an historian of the Second World War and its aftermath, and even I have to admit that I\'ve chosen a pretty crowded field to study. I went into my local bookshop recently, and this is what I saw. Thousands of books about the Second World War are published every year, and, actually, to tell you the truth, this is only a very tiny selection of what\'s on offer. We in the West, and, actually, increasingly people in other parts of the world too, we are just a little bit obsessed by the Second World War. We have whole TV stations which seem devoted to it. We write books about it, we write novels about it, we make films about it. We have university courses which are devoted to the Second World War. Whole museums are built to house World War II collections. Even our politicians like to get in on this act. Whenever there is an important anniversary of the war, they tend to gather and commemorate it, and make speeches. So, for example, at the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, June 2014, 17 heads of state took time out of their schedules to come and spend the day on the Normandy beaches. Seventeen! This included people like Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and so on. From my own country, we sent not only our Prime Minister, but also Queen Elisabeth II, who is - I mean, she is now in her nineties and largely retired from public life. What other international event can do all this? Even international summits struggle to get so many world leaders into one place at the same time. My question is: Why? What is it that all these world leaders, in fact what is it that all of us, think it is that we\'re remembering? Why are we all so obsessed by the the Second World War? You might think that somebody like me would be pretty pleased with this situation. As long as the World War II industry is booming, I am always going to have a job, right? But actually there is something about it that I find really a little bit disturbing, and I don\'t know whether that is just because I have an inherent distrust of a lot of politicians, or whether it\'s because I\'ve been trained to always question everything. But it strikes me that a lot of the rhetoric that gets thrown around about the Second World War, particularly by people like politicians and journalists and diplomats and so on, a lot of it doesn\'t seem to be about the Second World War at all; it seems to be about something else. I\'m not sure if I\'ve exactly put my finger on precisely what that thing is, but it seems to be something like a way of fostering national pride, or just trying to get people to feel good about themselves. Along the way, it seems to me that the Second World War has been turned into a little bit of a cartoon, where everybody knows who the good guys were, and everybody knows who the bad guys were. There is precious little space left anymore for any of that difficult grey area in between. To give you some kind of an idea about what on earth it is I am going on about, let me tell you a story from my own country, from Britain. In Britain, we like to think we are the real heroes of the Second World War. We tell stories about how we stood alone against the Nazis, about how we endured the bombing of the Blitz; how we kept calm and carried on, and eventually fought our way back into Europe and liberated it. We still call the Second World War ""Our Finest Hour"", as if it is some kind of golden age in our history. So whenever there is any kind of anniversary, or important event based around the Second World War, we Brits really go for it. One of these events happened quite recently, in the summer of 2012, when we opened up a brand new war memorial right in the middle of central London. It was a memorial to the men of Bomber Command, the men who flew the planes over Germany, dropped bombs and so on. This is what it looks like. As you can see, it\'s not exactly a shy and retiring piece of architecture, it\'s actually quite huge. It\'s by far the largest war memorial that we have in London, and I can tell you there are a lot of war memorials in London. As you walk into this thing, there is an inscription which tells you that it\'s dedicated to the 55,000 men of Bomber Command who lost their lives during World War II. Now, when this first opened, in the summer of 2012, I went along to have a look, see what I thought of it, have a walk around. There is something really quite moving about it actually. You step in through these great big pillars, and, up on the wall, you can see carved into the stone, there is a quotation from Winston Churchill saying exactly how much we owe to these men who lost their lives. Parts of the memorial are built out of an actual World War II aircraft that was shot down during the war. So they put a lot of thought into this. It\'s actually really quite inspiring. So as I was walking around this monument, I couldn\'t help but feel this real surge of pride. I felt proud of these men who had given their lives for something that I hold dear. I felt proud of my country, I felt proud of the British way of life which had produced heroes like this. And yet, there was this little voice in the back of my head which just wouldn\'t go away because I know that 55,000 men of Bomber Command died during World War II, but I also know that 500,000 Germans died beneath the bombs that these men dropped. A lot of those Germans were Nazis, and I dare say that a lot of them probably deserved it. But the vast majority of these people were just ordinary men, women and children, just like you and me. Are any of these people at all mentioned on this memorial? Of course they are not. If you would suggest such a thing in the summer of 2012, you probably would have been lynched. The Germans were our enemies during the Second World War. You can\'t mention the Germans on a British national monument. And yet not to mention them, to pretend that somehow this didn\'t happen, or even worse, that somehow it doesn\'t matter, that too makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable. Okay, the Germans are a difficult problem, so let\'s just put them to one side for a minute, and let\'s think instead about the other nationalities. And here is where the story starts getting interesting. Because if there is one thing that we Brits always forget about the bomber war, it\'s the fact that we didn\'t only bomb Germany. More than a third of British and American bombs dropped on Europe during the war were dropped not on Germany but on those countries we were supposed to be liberating. As a consequence, 50,000 French civilians were killed by our bombs. 10,000 Dutch civilians were killed by our bombs. Are any of these people mentioned on this memorial? Of course they\'re not. And it was while I was thinking about that particular group, that it finally dawned on me - actually something I probably should have realized right from the start - which is that memorials like this aren\'t designed to tell the whole story; they are only designed to tell those parts of the story that make British people feel good about themselves. That\'s all very well and good, but it does come at a cost. And I couldn\'t help thinking when I was walking around this thing: This was the summer of 2012, this was the summer when the Olympic Games was coming to London. So at exactly the moment when the entire world was arriving in our city, the message that we were advertising was that we will remember our wartime dead, but we won\'t remember yours. It\'s like the exact opposite of the Olympic spirit. It\'s not only the British who do this, of course it\'s not. Every nation does it, the Americans, for example. The Americans like to call their wartime veterans ""the greatest generation that any society has ever produced"", as if they have some kind of monopoly on heroism or something. (Laughter) They backed it up with a thousand Hollywood movies full of square-jawed American heroes defeating evil in the name of truth and freedom. The Chinese are the same. You know that in 2013 alone, Chinese TV companies produced over 200 TV dramatizations about the Second World War, each of them telling almost an identical story. Only, of course, this time, it\'s the Japanese who are all the evil monsters, and the Chinese who are all selfless heroes. And, of course, I could say the same thing about the French or the Koreans or the Norwegians or the Greeks. We all do this. We all like to think that we were the heroes. We all like to think that we were the victims. But what we don\'t like to remember is those grey areas. And it\'s that which I find most uncomfortable about this, because, as far as I am concerned, it\'s the grey areas that make history interesting. In a sense, all good history is about the grey areas. But a lot of people don\'t seem to have time for complicated stories. They don\'t have time for difficult and uncomfortable emotions. In fact, I\'m quickly coming to the conclusion that a lot of people don\'t really have time for history at all. What they really want is a myth. Now, you might ask yourselves: What does any of this matter? I mean, we all like a good story, don\'t we? If that story makes us feel good about ourselves, then so much the better. It\'s all in the past anyway, so what does it matter? But that\'s just the problem, isn\'t it? Because it\'s not all in the past. And there is a dark side to all of these stories and myths that can be really damaging. When the former Yugoslavia tore itself apart in the 1990s, it did so with World War II songs on its lips, and World War II atrocities in its heart. When the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014, Ukrainians and Russians accused one another of acting like Nazis. And then, of course, Hillary Clinton weighed in and started comparing Vladimir Putin to Hitler. These sorts of comparisons don\'t do anything to foster rational debate. If you were in an argument with someone, the last thing that is going to calm things down is that you start accusing them of being a Nazi. If you don\'t believe me, next time you\'re in an argument with your wife or your husband, give it a try and see what kind of reaction you get. (Laughter) I can see some of you seem to have tried it. (Laughter) My point is that as soon as we start bringing the Second World War into any of our arguments, we get so sort of carried away with our own national myths that all we actually end up doing is stirring things back up again. Let me give you a couple of examples. Take this economic crisis which has rocked the world since 2008. Here we are in Athens, and you all know about the economic crisis. All across Southern Europe, people have been suffering a real austerity, and largely this has been imposed by the European Union. But it\'s not always the European Union that gets the blame for this. Quite often, as the largest and most powerful country in the union, it\'s Germany that gets the blame. Now, how has this been portrayed in the press? Have we had a calm, rational economic debate about it? This is the way that the Italian press portrayed the situation in 2012: ""Quarto Reich."" (Laughter) ""The Fourth Reich."" This is the Italian way of saying that modern-day Germany is no better than the Nazis, as if there is a direct link between World War II and today. And take a look at that picture. They\'ve managed to dig something out that makes it look like Angela Merkel is making a Nazi salute. (Laughter) How about the Greek press? (Laughter) How have the Greeks portrayed it? Well, here is a Greek newspaper. (Laughter) from the same year, 2012, and you will notice a photograph of Angela Merkel once again, this time in a Nazi uniform. Obviously, it has been photoshopped. But what about that headline in red? ""Memorandum macht frei."" This is a direct reference to the motto that was written above the gates of the concentration camps in places like Auschwitz and Dachau. The implication here is that the whole of Greece is going to become like one giant German concentration camp as a consequence of the economic deal they\'ve had to do. Now, this is the sort of thing that makes an historian like me want to just give up and go and become a window cleaner or something. (Laughter) I mean, it\'s historical nonsense. None of these headlines have anything to do with the Second World War at all. They are about a modern-day problem, a modern situation. The only reason to mention the Second World War is to provoke an emotional response. If I have one message that I want you to take away with you today, it is this: Whenever you hear a politician, or a journalist, or a diplomat, mention the Second World War, I want alarm bells to ring. Because when public figures speak about the Second World War, they are not talking about what actually happened, they\'re invoking a myth. So whenever you hear a politician mention the war, I want you to ask yourselves what it is he is really trying to do. Is he trying to inspire you? - In which case that is relatively harmless. Or is he trying to fill you with fear? Is he trying to draw people together? In which case, again, that is relatively harmless. Or is he really trying to drive people apart? And above all, I want you to remind yourselves, and to remind everybody you know, that the Second World War is over. (Laughter) We live in a different world, with different values and different problems. These problems will never be solved, and they certainly will never be solved peacefully, if all we can think to do is to resurrect the Second World War. You know, history is a messy business, particularly the history of the Second World War. It\'s not there to make us feel good about ourselves; it\'s often ugly and uncomfortable, and desperately complicated. It\'s full of those grey areas. If we could all just learn to accept that, then this world, our world, would be a much more peaceful place. Thank you. (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost exactly 10 years ago, I was sitting in an exam room that was way too cold waiting to meet my new oncologist. I was terrified. Even though my partner at the time was sitting right by my side, I felt completely alone. I had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, and it seemed at the time that a single bright spot on a scan of my right lung meant that the cancer had already spread. I had metastatic breast cancer. I had no medical training at this point, but I knew what it meant if it were true: incurable breast cancer. Terminal breast cancer. I was 27 years old, had just been accepted to medical school, and I wondered if I was already at the end of my life."", '01:07': 'My new oncologist was not a warm person. She dealt in simple facts, as many brilliant physicians do. ""Our body is made up of cells,"" she started. I stopped her. ""I\'m starting medical school soon. I know."" Instead of taking this as a signal to go backward, to start again, she went forward. She said that I would need to start on chemotherapy to control the cancer. She launched into the details of the drug and the side effects and the schedule. I reminded her that we hadn\'t even yet biopsied the bright spot on my lung, and I asked if she was sure that it was cancer.', '01:54': ""I remember viscerally how she seemed almost frustrated with my question. Perhaps she thought I wasn't following along with her explanations, or, worse still, I was in denial. I simply wanted her to understand that, as her patient, the biopsy was not just a mere formality to prove an already foregone conclusion. It was a steel needle through skin, muscle and bone that would deliver a deep piece of me to the surface and answer a question I wish didn't have to be asked. Before the biopsy, I could be a 27-year-old woman who might have metastatic breast cancer, who probably had metastatic breast cancer. This is a critical distinction, but it's not one that's emphasized in the most elite oncology training. Instead, I was dismissed with an appointment to start treatment in just a few weeks."", '02:53': 'So much has happened since that first visit. Ironically, the biopsy was not just a mere formality. My former oncologist was right.', '03:03': '(Laughter)', '03:04': 'It did show cancer, but it was a totally separate lung cancer, and as crazy as it sounds, this was great news. I did not have metastatic breast cancer, I had two different cancers, but both of them were localized, and so the lung cancer was localized enough that it could be removed. And so the onslaught of treatments began with a lung surgery, continued with chemotherapy and ended with a breast surgery just after my 28th birthday.', '03:36': 'And then two weeks later, I started medical school. My new oncologist --', '03:44': '(Laughter)', '03:45': 'who deals much more fluidly both with facts and their implications, very reasonably suggested that I should defer my acceptance to medical school for a year, take some time to rest, to recover, and I trusted her advice. I felt terrible during the intensive chemotherapy sessions. And so I wrote to the dean. I explained my circumstances, and a deferral was speedily granted.', '04:12': 'But as the chemo fog lifted, I wondered what I was going to do with a year. Should I go to the beach?', '04:21': '(Laughter)', '04:22': ""I wasn't really a beach person."", '04:25': '(Laughter)', '04:26': 'And how many years did I have left, anyway? I really wanted to go to medical school. It seemed like a missing piece of my puzzle.', '04:35': ""So instead of going around and around with indecision, I asked myself: What's the worst that could happen? Well, I could be too weak or too sick to do the work. It could be too hard for me emotionally. I could fail out of medical school. But then I remembered, that wouldn't be the worst thing that happened to me even that year. So why not get started? Why not continue living the way that I wanted to live? So I did."", '05:05': 'Bald and rail thin, I put on my best earrings and my favorite dress, and I started. I pretended to belong, and I began to. There is no way to describe how hard it was. Some days it felt impossible. It felt as if I was doing things that would never matter in the future. But every day, I asked myself: Are you still enjoying this? Is this still what you want to be doing? And every day, the answer was yes, sometimes a very qualified yes, but a yes.', '05:40': ""And then, just as I was getting comfortable and feeling like I might not necessarily fail out of medical school, I received even more devastating news. I learned that I had a mutation in a gene called TP53, or p53 for short. Known as the guardian of the genome, a mutation -- p53 is responsible for supervising the repair of our DNA. A mutation in this gene means errors go uncorrected. It means that normal cells become cancerous at a much higher rate. All of a sudden, with this knowledge, my medical history made a terrible kind of sense. I had had a childhood cancer -- rhabdomyosarcoma -- at age seven. It recurred when I was a teenager. And this was all before p53 had been discovered in the lab. Then I'd had young adult breast and lung cancers."", '06:33': 'With the knowledge of this mutation, it seemed that there was likely no end to the number of cancers that I could expect in my future. And yet, I decided to become a radiation oncologist.', '06:48': '(Laughter)', '06:49': 'I hoped to graduate from residency in just a few months, move to a new city and start my first real job as a doctor and researcher, because of grit, because of privilege, because of therapy, because of my medical teams and my family and my teachers, because genetic diagnoses should give us the knowledge to move forward.', '07:18': ""And even in the year 2020, that generally doesn't mean miracle cures or medical breakthroughs. Having a devastating genetic diagnosis means learning to live with uncertainty. It means learning that you and your diagnosis are not the worst thing that could happen. Learning to live with uncertainty means walking forward into a life that is as full of beauty as it is of challenges. It means learning for yourself that cancer is just part of your story. It may not be the worst thing that happens to you, and if it is, that's OK. You can claim that, and you can own that, but let that be a narrative that you author and you authorize, not one that's prescribed to you by someone else. Have your deferral letter in hand, but use it on your terms."", '08:13': 'As I come to the end of my oncology training, I have déjà vu again and again with the following scenario: A patient has cancer. There are several options, all of which offer a different balance between cure and quality of life, between the possibility of alleviating suffering and the possibility of causing suffering. An oncologist lays out the options, but, somewhere in the discussion, things get skewed. The choice becomes something more like, ""Well, you could choose to do something, or you could choose to do nothing. We could be aggressive, and treat your cancer, or we could watch it."" And 9.9 times out of 10, the patient says, ""I want to do everything I can do."" Of course. Who wouldn\'t want everything?', '09:09': ""But what is everything? Is everything the ability to sit in your own home in front of your window bathed in sunshine and surrounded by family? Is everything still being able to feel your fingers and your toes, because they haven't gone numb from chemotherapy? As oncologists, our everything is cancer treatment. It's radiation and surgery and chemotherapy and novel treatments. And for us, the worst thing that could happen -- and I have heard more than one oncologist say this -- the worst thing that could happen is that the patient will develop metastatic disease. Or, the worst thing that could happen is that five years from now, the cancer will grow, and I'll have to give more radiation."", '09:56': 'As a patient and as an oncologist, I would never argue that these are not devastating outcomes. But are they the worst? Should cancer control be at the center of our thinking, always?', '10:13': 'Many unspeakably, unfathomably painful and brutal things have happened to me because of my cancers and my genetic mutation. And yet, I consider myself very lucky indeed, because the worst thing that could happen never came to pass; because I have let devastation and uncertainty sit at the table, but somewhere off to the side. When I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I went to Boston for a second opinion, because what could I lose? When my oncologist gave me very good and very safe and very standard advice, I started medical school anyway, even though I was undergoing active cancer treatment.', '10:57': ""Instead of shying away from patients with cancer, I became a radiation oncologist, and I work with patients who are very much like me every single day. Instead of imagining the suffering that I might cause to a future partner when I died of cancer, I married my wonderful husband. Because the worst thing that can happen is always a series of negatives. It's blank spaces that should be filled with life."", '11:29': 'So what is the most that I have leaned in to this kind of radical uncertainty? Well, this is William. He is the most joyful person that I have ever met, and in just over a year, he has already made the world a better place.', '11:55': ""As oncologists, we talk to our patients as if the worst thing that could happen is that their cancer could come back, or that it could spread, or that they could die from it. As a patient, I know that these are paramount. But I want to change the way that we think about this, and I want to change the way that we talk about this with our patients. As a patient, the worst thing that can happen is that cancer robs you of opportunity, of the ability to be and to do and to love. And it will. At least temporarily it will. But to minimize this loss of life in the living, that is the harder, and I would say, truer job of the oncologist: to take all the tools that we have and situate them in the context of a patient's whole entire life; to be guides for how to sit with suffering, acknowledge it deeply, but to not let fear of future suffering be the narrative for the journey forward."", '13:03': ""One of my mentors always says the medicine part is easy. And it never feels that way to a junior doctor, but its contours are finite. We have big studies to guide us, and it's what we learn to do in residency. Much harder is learning how to help each patient navigate the multitudes contained in their illness."", '13:34': ""So I find it really funny that, in retrospect, my life looks like a neat package. It looks as if I planned each successive step and that perhaps cancer has led to the good things in my life. Step one: apply to medical school. Step two: get diagnosed with and treated for cancer. And step three: have it all, a career and a family. But I will tell you that each phase was a leap of faith despite an almost paralyzing uncertainty. And so it's that courage that I try to give to each of my patients. I try to do this regardless of the technical medical details of cancers and treatment decisions and mutations, regardless of the slippery fiction of prognosis. I try to learn what they want and what they need, what they wish and what they worry, what they dream about, what animated them before and what will sustain them during the beastly process of cancer treatment. It doesn't actually take that much time. It does take a few focused, quiet moments that require intentional cultivation. But this is partnership, and it matters, because the worst thing that can happen is to have an oncologist who does everything -- everything -- to help cure your cancer and who does nothing to help you live your life."", '15:40': 'Thank you.', '15:41': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, that's all very well, but that's not something we can do anything about really. And indeed, asteroids do come close to the Earth from time to time. Earlier this week, one did. Luckily it didn't hit the Earth. We can't really prepare. But the key point is that the other mass extinctions in the history of life were not caused by impact. They were caused by climate change. Immediately, you can see now how that matters. I will briefly characterise one of them that I have worked upon. At the end of the Permian Period, 250 million years ago, there was another major extinction. This was before the dinosaurs. And the sequence of events was that massive volcanoes errupted in Russia. They were so huge that they poured out enormous amounts of lava, of course, but more importantly, they poured out gases into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide. And carbon dioxide is famous as a greenhouse gas, meaning it heats the atmosphere. We have primary evidence that around the equator, ocean temperatures warmed up to 40 degrees plus. So this is like a very warm shower. You might think that's OK. Maybe for 10 minutes but not for day after day after day. And so life had to progressively flee out of the equatorial zones. It became crowded at the poles and there was great extinction. So we learnt from that that carbon dioxide and global warming can cause extinction whatever the cause of that carbon dioxide, whether it comes from volcanoes or human activity. So we've learnt three things that we can illustrate and use for predicting into the future, what may happen to life. We've learnt that we can calculate the rate of extinction by looking at historical extinctions and at that rate of extinction, even at the minimal figures, it's at least one hundred times what it ought to be. Secondly, we've learnt something about risk, which species are most at risk of extinction, and I think that's fairly straightforward. But we need the evidence to be able to argue the case. And thirdly, we've learnt that the whole history of the Earth records a rich record of climate change. We don't need to do experiments, we don't need to imagine what a world would be like without the polar ice caps. It has existed and we can study it. So to conclude, my aim has not been simply to spread doom and gloom, but to indicate that we have the power to change. And in order to change, we have to accept reality along the lines that we're mentioning. And we have to ask the right questions about what we should do. And in order to decide what we should do, we need to use evidence. And some great evidence comes from the history of the Earth and the history of life. Thank you very much.

https://www.ted.com/talks/ryan_martin_why_some_anger_can_be_good_for_you,Why some anger can be good for you,"Anger researcher Ryan Martin draws from a career studying what makes people mad to explain some of the cognitive processes behind anger and why a healthy dose of it is, in fact, useful. ""Your anger exists in you because it offered your ancestors an evolutionary advantage,"" he says. ""It's a powerful and healthy force in your life.""",,,101779,2018-09-11T16:00:49+00:00,"['science', 'mental health', 'emotions', 'psychology', 'life']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro', 'Ελληνικά', '日本語', '한국어']",Ryan Martin,Psychologist,"{'0:00': 'I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend, and it reads, ""You will not believe what just happened. I\'m so mad right now."" So you do the dutiful thing as a friend, and you ask for details, and they tell you a story about what happened to them at the gym or at work or on their date last night. You listen, and you try to understand why they\'re so mad. Maybe you even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad. (Laughter) Maybe you even offer some suggestions. Now, in that moment, you are doing essentially what I get to do every day because I\'m an anger researcher, and as an anger researcher, I spend a good part of my professional life - who am I kidding, also my personal life - (Laughter) studying why people get mad. I study the types of thoughts they have when they get mad and even what they do then, whether it\'s getting into fights or breaking things or even yelling at people in all caps on the Internet. (Laughter) As you can imagine, when people hear I\'m an anger researcher, they want to talk to me about their anger and share with me their anger stories. It\'s not because they need a therapist, though that does sometimes happen, it\'s really because anger is universal. It\'s something we all feel, and it\'s something they can relate to. We\'ve been feeling it since the first few months of life, when we didn\'t get what we wanted and our cries of protests, things like, ""What do you mean, you won\'t pick up the rattle, dad? I want it!"" (Laughter) We feel it throughout our teenage years, as my mom can certainly attest to with me. Sorry, mom. We feel it to the very end. In fact, anger has been with us at some of the worst moments of our lives; it\'s a natural and expected part of our grief. But it\'s also been with us at some of the best moments of our lives, with those special occasions like weddings and vacations often marred by these everyday frustrations - bad weather, travel delays - that feel horrible in the moment but then are ultimately forgotten when things go okay. So I have many conversations with people about their anger, and through those conversations, I\'ve learned that many people - and I bet many people here right now - you see anger as a problem. You see the way it interferes in your life, the way it damages relationships, maybe even in a way that\'s scary. And while I get all of that, I see anger a little differently, and today I want to tell you something important about your anger, and it\'s this: Anger is a powerful and healthy force in your life. It\'s good that you feel it. You need to feel it. But to understand all of that, we have to back up and talk about why we get mad in the first place. A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher, who wrote about this back in 1996 in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger. For most of us - and I bet most of you - it feels as simple as this: I get mad when I\'m provoked. Right? You hear it in the language people use. They say things like, ""It makes me so mad when people drive this slow."" Or ""I got mad because she left the milk out again."" Or my favorite: ""I don\'t have an anger problem; people just need to stop messing with me."" (Laughter) Now, in the spirit of better understanding those types of provocations, I ask a lot of people, including my friends and colleagues and even family, ""What are the things that really get to you? What makes you mad?"" And by the way, one of the advantages of being an anger researcher is that I\'ve spent more than a decade generating a comprehensive list of all the things that really irritate my colleagues. Right? Just in case I need it. (Laughter) But their answers are fascinating because they say things like, ""When my sports team loses,"" ""People who chew too loudly."" And it\'s surprisingly common, by the way. (Laughter) ""People who walk too slowly."" That one\'s mine. And of course, roundabouts. Right? Roundabouts. (Laughter) I can tell you honestly, there is no rage like roundabout rage. (Laughter) Sometimes their answers aren\'t minor at all. Sometimes they talk about racism and sexism and bullying and environmental destruction, big global problems we all face. But sometimes, their answers are very specific, maybe even oddly specific. ""That wet line you get across your shirt when you accidentally lean against the counter of a public bathroom."" (Laughter) Yeah, super gross, right? Or, ""Flash drives - there\'s only two ways to plug them in, so why does it always take me three tries?"" (Laughter) Whether it\'s minor or major, whether it\'s general or specific, we can look at these examples, and we can tease out some common themes. We get angry in situations that are unpleasant, that feel unfair, where our goals are blocked, that could have been avoided, and that leave us feeling powerless. This is a recipe for anger, but you can also tell that anger is probably not the only thing we\'re feeling in these situations - right? Anger doesn\'t happen in a vacuum. We can feel angry at the same time that we\'re scared or sad or feeling a host of other emotions. But here\'s the thing. These provocations - they aren\'t making us mad. At least not on their own, and we know that because if they were, we\'d all get angry over the same things, and we don\'t. The reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry, so there\'s got to be something else going on. What is that something else? Well, we know what we\'re doing and feeling at the moment of that provocation matters. We call this the pre-anger state. Are you hungry, are you tired? Are you anxious about something else, are you running late for something? When you\'re feeling those things, those provocations feel that much worse. But what matters the most is not the provocation, it\'s not the pre-anger state, it\'s this: it\'s how we interpret that provocation, it\'s how we make sense of it in our lives. When something happens to us, we first decide: is this good or bad; is it fair or unfair; is it blameworthy; is it punishable? That\'s primary appraisal, it\'s when you evaluate the event itself. We decide what it means in the context of our lives, and then, once we\'ve done that, we decide how bad it is. That\'s secondary appraisal. We say, ""Is this the worst thing that\'s ever happened, or can I cope with this?"" To illustrate that, I want you to imagine you are driving somewhere. Before I go any further, I should tell you if I were an evil genius, and I wanted to create a situation that was going to make you mad, that situation would look a lot like driving. (Laughter) It\'s true. You are, by definition, on your way somewhere, so everything that happens - traffic, other drivers, road construction - it feels like it\'s blocking your goals. There are all these written and unwritten rules of the road, and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you, usually without consequence. And who\'s violating those rules? Anonymous others, people you will never see again, making them a very easy target for your wrath. (Laughter) So you\'re driving somewhere, thus teed up to be angry, and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit. It\'s frustrating because you can\'t really see why they\'re driving so slow. Right? That\'s primary appraisal. You\'ve looked at this and you said, ""It\'s bad and it\'s blameworthy."" But maybe you also decide it\'s not that big a deal. You\'re not in a hurry, doesn\'t matter. That\'s secondary appraisal. You don\'t get angry. But now imagine you\'re on your way to a job interview. What that person is doing - it hasn\'t changed. Right? So, primary appraisal doesn\'t change: still bad, still blameworthy. But your ability to cope with it sure does because all of a sudden, you\'re going to be late to that job interview. All of a sudden, you are not going to get your dream job, the one that was going to give you piles and piles of money - right? (Laughter) Somebody else is going to get your dream job, and you\'re going to be broke. You\'re going to be destitute. You might as well stop now, turn around, move in with your parents. (Laughter) Why? Because of this person in front of me. Scratch that; this is not a person. This is a monster. (Laughter) And this monster is here just to ruin your life. (Laughter) Now, that thought process, it\'s called catastrophizing, the one where we make the worst of things. It\'s one of the primary types of thoughts that we know is associated with chronic anger. But there\'s a couple of others. Misattributing causation. Angry people tend to put blame where it doesn\'t belong, not just on people, but actually inanimate objects as well. If you think that sounds ridiculous, think about the last time you lost your car keys, and you said, ""Where did those car keys go?"" Because you know they ran off on their own. (Laughter) They tend to overgeneralize. They use words like always, never, every. ""This always happens to me."" ""I never get what I want."" Or, ""I hit every stoplight on the way here today."" Demandingness - they put their own needs ahead of the needs of others. ""I don\'t care why this person is driving so slow. They need to speed up or move over so I can get to this job interview."" And finally, inflammatory labeling. They call people fools, idiots, monsters, or a whole bunch of things I\'ve been told not to say in this TED talk. (Laughter) For a long time, psychologists have referred to these as cognitive distortions or even irrational beliefs, and yes, sometimes they are irrational. Maybe even most of the time. But sometimes, these thoughts are totally rational. There is unfairness in the world. There are cruel, selfish people, and it\'s not only okay to be angry when we\'re treated poorly, it\'s right to be angry when we\'re treated poorly. If there\'s one thing I want you to remember from my talk today, it\'s this: Your anger exists in you as an emotion because it offered your ancestors, both human and non human, with an evolutionary advantage. Just as your fear alerts you to danger, your anger alerts you to injustice. It\'s one of the ways your brain communicates to you that you have had enough. What\'s more, it energizes you to confront that injustice. Think for a second about the last time you got mad. Your heart rate increased, your breathing increased, you started to sweat. That\'s your sympathetic nervous system, or fight-or-flight system, kicking in to offer you the energy you need to respond. And that\'s just the stuff you noticed. At the same time, your digestive system slowed down so you can conserve energy. That\'s why your mouth went dry. Your blood vessels dilated to get blood to your extremities. That\'s why your face went red. It\'s all part of this complex pattern of physiological experiences that exist today because they helped your ancestors deal with cruel and unforgiving forces of nature. The problem is that the thing your ancestors did to deal with their anger, to physically fight, they\'re no longer reasonable or appropriate. You can\'t and you shouldn\'t swing a club every time you\'re provoked. (Laughter) But here\'s the good news. You are capable of something your non-human ancestors weren\'t capable of, and that is the capacity to regulate your emotions. Even when you want to lash out, you can stop yourself, and you can channel that anger into something more productive. So often when we talk about anger, we talk about how to keep from getting angry. We tell people to calm down or relax; we even tell people to let it go. All of that assumes that anger is bad, and that it\'s wrong to feel it. But instead, I like to think of anger as a motivator. The same way your thirst motivates you to get a drink of water, the same way your hunger motivates you to get a bite to eat, your anger can motivate you to respond to injustice. Because we don\'t have to think too hard to find things we should be mad about. When we go back to the beginning, yes, some of those things are silly and not worth getting angry over, but racism, sexism, bullying, environmental destruction - those things are real, those things are terrible, and the only way to fix them is to get mad first, and then channel that anger into fighting back. You don\'t have to fight back with aggression or hostility or violence. There are infinite ways that you can express your anger. You can protest; you can write letters to the editor; you can donate to and volunteer for causes. You can create art; you can create literature; you can create poetry and music. You can create a community that cares for one another and does not allow those atrocities to happen. So the next time you feel yourself getting angry, instead of trying to turn it off, I hope you\'ll listen to what that anger is telling you, and then I hope you\'ll channel it into something positive and productive. Thank you.

I have previously lived at two addresses in Sussex, and two others in North East London. While growing up, my family lived in a detached house in Kent and took holidays to India every year. They mostly did their shopping online at Ocado, gave money to charities and read the Financial Times. Now, I live in a recently converted flat with a private landlord, and I have a housemate. I'm interested in movies and startups, and I have taken five holidays in the past 12 months, mostly to visit friends abroad. I'm about to buy flights within 14 days. My annual salary is between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds a year. I don't own a TV or watch any scheduled programming, but I do enjoy on-demand services such as Netflix or Now TV. Last week, I passed through Upper Street in North London on Monday and Wednesday evenings at 7 p.m. I cook a little, but I tend to eat out or get takeaways often. My favourite cuisines are Thai and Mexican food. I don't own any furniture, and I don't have any children. On weeknights, I tend to spend the evenings with my university friends having dinner. I usually buy my groceries at Sainsbury's but only because it's on my way home. I don't care for cars or own one. I don't like any form of housework, and I have a cleaner who lets herself in while I'm at work. On Fridays, you'll find me at the pub after work. At home, I'm far more likely to be browsing restaurant reviews rather than managing my finances or looking at property prices online. I like the idea of living abroad someday. I prefer to work as a team than on my own. I'm ambitious, and it's important to me that my many thinks I'm doing well. I'm rarely swayed by others' views. This motley set of characteristics, attitudes, thoughts, and desires come very close to defining me as a person. It is also a precise and accurate description of what a group of companies I had never heard of, personal data trackers, had learned about me. My journey to uncover what data companies knew began in 2014, when I became curious about the murky world of data brokers, a multi-billion-pound industry of companies that collect, package, and sell detailed profiles of individuals based on their online and offline behaviours. I decided to write about it for Wired Magazine. What I found out shocked me, and reinforced my anxieties about a profit-led system designed to log behaviours every time we interact with the connected world. I already knew about my daily records being collected by services such as Google Maps, Search, Facebook, or contactless credit card transactions. But you combine that with public information such as land registry, council tax, or voter records, along with my shopping habits and real-time health and location information, and these benign data sets begin to reveal a lot, such as whether you're optimistic, political, ambitious, or a risk-taker. Even as you're listening to me, you may be sedentary, but your smartphone can reveal your exact location, and even your posture. Your life is being converted into such a data package to be sold on. Ultimately, you are the product. Ostensibly, we're all protected by data protection laws. In the UK, the law states that any personal data set has to be stripped of identifiers such as your name or your National Insurance number. Personal data is considered anything that can be traced directly back to you. without the need for additional information. This doesn't mean it can't be sold on. It only means that they need your permission. Simple examples of personal data include your full credit card number, your bank statement, or a criminal record. However, I discovered that online anonymity is a complete myth. Particulars such as your postcode, your date of birth, and your gender can be traded freely and without your permission because they're not considered personal but pseudonymous. In other words, they can't be traced back to you without the need for additional information. So why does it matter if a bunch of companies you've never heard of know your age or your postcode, you may think. Well, it matters quite a lot. About a decade ago, Latanya Sweeney, a professor of privacy at Harvard University proved that about 87% of US citizens could be uniquely identified by just three facts about them: their zip code, their date of birth, and their gender. In the UK, where we have far fewer citizens serviced by much longer postcodes, that probability is far higher. Professor Sweeney proved this in a rather cheeky way when William Weld, a former governor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the US decided to support the commercial release of 135,000 state employee health records along with their families, including his own. These records did not contain a name or a social security number, but did contain hundreds of fields of sensitive medical information including drugs prescribed, hospitalisations, and procedures performed on these employees. For $20, Professor Sweeney purchased the voter records for Cambridge, Massachusetts, containing the names, zip codes, dates of birth, and gender for every voter in the area, and then cross-referenced this with their health records. Within minutes, she had pinpointed Governor Welds' own health records. Only six people in Cambridge shared his date of birth. Three of them were men. And he was the only one living in his zip code. Professor Sweeney sent the governor his health records in the post. (Laughter) Every day, we hear about new examples of companies digging ever deeper into our personal lives. In the November US presidential election, a little-known British company known as Cambridge Analytica was tasked with winning the election for a certain candidate: Donald Trump, using data analytics. The company employed cookies online to track people around the web, logging every website visited, every search term typed, and every video watched. They also created a viral Facebook quiz to dig into people's personalities, which was taken by over six million people. In total, they managed to amass data on 220 million voting Americans with an average of about 5,000 pieces of data on each person. They then used this data to understand people's inner feelings and then targeted adverts to them on Facebook. Researchers have called them a propaganda machine. It's not just large companies digging into your life; it's free apps and small startups as well. I realised on my phone that every time I logged fitness data into the app Endomondo, it was sharing my details including my location and gender with third-party advertisers. WebMD, a symptom checkers app, was sharing even more sensitive information including the symptoms, procedures, and drugs viewed by users within its app with its third parties. Fitbit was sharing data with Yahoo. A pregnancy tracking app was selling on information about its users' ovulation cycles and fertility cycles with people or advertisers like InMobi. As long as my phone is turned on, my location can be tracked, not just by the obvious apps like Google Maps, but a whole host of unrelated services from Uber to Twitter, Photos, Snapchat, TripAdvisor, and others. You're not even safe in your own home. In 2015, Samsung was found to be recording people in the homes in which their TVs had been sold using their voice recognition systems. They have now adapted this so they only record when the voice recognition is activated.  But the creepy factor remains. Even services like Google and Facebook, trusted and used by billions around the world, have been accused of crossing the line. A few weeks ago, my husband and I were driving home from work and discussing where we should have dinner. I suggested a restaurant that I knew was somewhere on our way back and then opened up Google Maps to plot it. Turns out it was already marked on the map with a little bubble. That sinking feeling of being watched is not unique to me. There have been several anecdotal reports of people being shown adverts based on things and conversations they were having in real life, prompting concerns that Facebook and Google are eavesdropping on people via their personal devices. To piece together what all these companies knew about me, I spoke to a data profiler called Eyeota. Eyeota uses cookies to assign me to thousands of different categories, including my job, how many children I have, and whether I'm likely to buy Star Wars memorabilia. (Laughter) They don't know my name, but they know more about me than my neighbours do. Eyeota also buys information from third parties such as the credit rating agency Experian, which amasses a massive database of 15 different demographic types and 66 lifestyles, all based on people's post codes. Because Eyeota buys this information, it knows that I'm more likely to take taxis home rather than night buses late at night and that I'm very, very unlikely to ever be found in a DIY store. (Laughter) It can then sell this information on to the highest bidder. Sometimes, large data sets can be useful for the public good, for example for the use of health researchers or city and urban planners. But most of this information being collected is sustained by advertisers and traded commercially. In fact, eMarketer has predicted that the online advertising industry, which is based almost completely on data targeting and tracking, will hit an all-time high of 77 billion dollars this year. If you think you don't care about being unmasked, you may want to reconsider. Personalised browser ads may be harmless, but connecting disparate aspects of your life to predict your future behaviour could lead to unexpected consequences. For instance, decisions on whether your child gets to go to a certain university or what price you pay for your home or car insurance premiums could be made based on data  given to third parties that you never intended to, such as your own lifestyle habits or family members' ailments. In 2014, Ross Anderson, a professor of Privacy and Security at Cambridge University found that the NHS had been sharing its hospitals' database, which included details of hospitalisations for every citizen in Britain with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, a body that was researching how likely people are to develop chronic illnesses at certain ages. Of course, this resulted in an increase in health insurance premiums. As the amount of data that is collected increases exponentially, it becomes much easier to identify you. For example, your Fitbit measures our heart rate or your gait patterns and these can be used to estimate things like your height, your weight, or even your gender. These are details that are very hard to mimic or change. The data is no longer about you. It is you. Companies are also starting to predict future behaviours - for example, whether you're a trustworthy driver, a good employee, or a good credit risk, based on things like your social media activity, your health and fitness, or your home energy use. The more the companies know about you - where you live, how many children you have, what your medical ailments are, what you buy - your anonymity becomes irrelevant. What's more, you lose your right to free choice, as companies make decisions on your behalf without your knowledge. Along my journey of discovery, my first reaction was shock. I immediately wrote to my local council and asked them to make my voter records private. I made up a fake email address, and I started registering with a fake age and gender. I turned off targeted advertising, and I asked Facebook to send me all the information that they held on me, including things I had deleted, and spent hours poring over it obsessively. But after a few weeks I realised this was a pointless exercise. I couldn't be a digital hermit. It wasn't realistic for me to stop using social media, search and navigation apps, and my iPhone, all a part of modern life that I cherished and needed. Instead, I realised that the knowledge itself was empowering. Knowing all the different ways in which my data was being shared and collected made me more responsible about where I put it. For example, I stopped signing up to supposedly free services, for example, a VIP card at my local hairdresser or a discount coupon at your supermarket.

I\'m being led from checkpoint to checkpoint, and before each door opens, the door behind me slams shut. The lock echoes while I\'m searched and interviewed again. It\'s a maximum security jail, the largest in the country: the Cook County Jail, in Chicago, Illinois. ""I\'m here for the meeting,"" I say again, repeat my credentials. It\'s my first time visiting a jail, and everyone can tell. They take my phone, they take my keys, and they take my little bag of almonds. Almonds! Finally, I\'m left in a room with two men who stare at me as I enter. One is a gang leader, the other is a corrections officer, and each of them is the size of four of me, which basically means I\'m outnumbered eight to one. Their arms are strapped across their chests, flashes of anger in their eyes - I\'m terrified and I\'m thinking, They were worried about my almonds? (Laughter) The heavy door behind me slams shut. It\'s just the three of us now. No one moves. Now, who\'s had the very same experience? (Laughter) But whether you\'re a C-level executive or a spouse or you\'re a part of any kind of team, you probably know this to be true: that one conversation can change everything. So I want you to think of a tough conversation that people around you need to have. You got it? There\'s some issue that\'s holding them back from accomplishing what they want to accomplish. I believe they might be one conversation away from accomplishing that thing but they\'re not having the conversation they need to have, or they\'ve tried and it hasn\'t gone well. I\'ve led some pretty tough conversations in some pretty tough environments: Northern Ireland, the Middle East, corporate boardrooms. I actually have a PhD in leading difficult conversations, and here\'s what I\'ve learned: We\'re not having the conversations we need to have. And that\'s mostly because we\'re afraid; we don\'t want to make things worse. But not having these conversations or having them poorly is really bad. And most of us know this from our work. Some issue arises for a team - it could be a minor issue, but it goes unaddressed. Frustration sets in, communication constricts, tensions rise, trust evaporates, and collaboration is done. Remember, we\'re talking about teams that perform surgeries, land planes, run schools. Many of us are a part of teams that perform crucial functions. We can\'t afford to avoid tough conversations. So that conversation that you thought of that people around you need to have, you can lead that conversation. And I\'m going to give you three simple rules to being vastly more effective in leading it. Wherever you use these rules - at work, at home - people are going to thank you. And then, they\'ll start reaching goals they couldn\'t reach before, and they will come find you and thank you again, and you\'ll benefit because the people around you will be more successful, not miserable, which makes your life better. So, the three rules. Rule number one: move toward the conflict. Most of us don\'t like conflict, but it\'s normal, healthy and totally human. Without conflict, problems hide everywhere - big problems, problems we all want to solve. So, conflict is information, and handled well, conflict is opportunity. So rather than running from it or pretending it\'s not there, move toward it. More on this in a minute. But rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do, pretend you don\'t. Ask questions about people\'s experiences and listen to what they say. Important things will be said because you are listening, and the better you listen, the better the people having the conversation will listen to each other. And finally, rule three: keep quiet. Don\'t panic in the few seconds it takes for people to respond; they just need time. If you\'re jumpy about pauses, they\'ll see that and lose confidence in the conversation. Some of the best breakthroughs I\'ve seen in really difficult conversations have emerged out of a brief period of silence. Don\'t rush in to rescue everyone from that awkward moment. It\'s your job to show them that moment is OK. Now, let me tell you about some tough conversations where these three rules saved the day. We left off in the Cook County Jail, with an inmate population that has at times swelled to above 10,000. It\'s not an easy place to be. But getting released and not winding up back inside is also difficult. Inmates are released into gang territory, often with no way to get home - if they have a home. And the barriers to finding housing, employment and education are such that it\'s no wonder so many returned to the jail again and again, back through the system. So my team convened every stakeholder we could - former gang members, business leaders, corrections officers in the jail, social workers, the sheriff\'s office, clergy - to see if they could start working together. City officials warned me not to bring all of these groups together, but I felt no chance of success without having this tough conversation. Well, the first meeting came, and whatever I tried, nothing worked. The groups wouldn\'t sit next to each other, wouldn\'t even look at each other. The gang leader and the corrections officer I told you about, they were the first to arrive that day. This was the toughest conversation I\'ve ever led. We take a break, and I\'m desperate. I approach that corrections officer, who hasn\'t said a single word all morning, and I just go for it. I charge up to him, and I say, ""Hey, buddy, what do I gotta do to get you to pipe down in there?"" (Laughter) And he looks at me like - (Laughter) And I think I looked at him kind of like - (Laughter) Remember rule number one: move toward the conflict. Miraculously, he doesn\'t squish me. (Laughter) He actually laughs and says, ""Nah, I\'m not much for talking."" But because I had moved toward the conflict and called out the obvious, I had a small opening with him, and the disastrous meeting was about to start again, and I needed something. I needed him. Rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do, pretend you don\'t. So I asked him, ""What do people get wrong about what you do?"" which is another way of asking, How are you misunderstood? I don\'t know. Tell me. Tell me what this is like for you. And his face changes. He looks like a different person. And he says, ""People think that I feel normal about this, keeping people in cages all day. There\'s nothing normal about my job."" Back in the meeting, I ditch my agenda, and I ask the same question again, and I kept my eyes off the business leaders, and I avoided eye contact with the city officials, and I stared down my big buddy until he went for it. He shocked everyone, told them all just what he told me - there\'s nothing normal about my job - and it\'s a huge opening, and now others are ready to share. And because I don\'t know anything, I keep asking questions, and one by one, they all have their chance to describe everything about their day-to-day, minute-to-minute work, which means everyone is getting heard by everyone. My naive questions make it possible for them to hear one another because they\'re not addressing each other head on; they\'re answering my questions, but they\'re all hearing it. Rule number three: keep quiet. Especially when they start talking, it\'s tempting to direct the conversation. I didn\'t interfere, and they opened up collaboration that was unprecedented in Chicago. The guards and the previously incarcerated, business leaders and faith leaders, all bringing their expertise together, joining forces so that inmates would have a mentor waiting for them and a job lined up before their release from jail - all as a result of that conversation. I\'ll give you one more. In Northern Ireland, for 30 years, bombs could rip through restaurants, bars and shops at any moment. Violence was everywhere. Shootings, abductions - people lived in fear. This period is known as ""the Troubles."" I led some tough conversations in Belfast, the epicenter of the fighting. I remember these enormous murals, paintings of masked gunmen, one of them pointing a rifle right down at you as you walked past. My job was to help Protestants and Catholics, Loyalists and Republicans have some very difficult conversations. We moved toward the conflict, rule number one, by recruiting men who had committed acts of political violence. During armed conflict, fighters become heroes, and afterward, they remain influential, so we did everything we could to include them. Now, it would have been easier not to recruit combatants: the atmosphere wouldn\'t have been as charged. But remember: move toward the conflict. Rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do ... (Audience) Pretend you don\'t. pretend you don\'t. No advice from me, no commentary, no ideas - those are all short cuts, and the point here is to take the long way. The more I asked, the more they shared. The more they shared, the more they listened. And the more they listened, the more they began to accept silence as a part of their experience. Which gets us to rule number three: keep quiet - show them that silence is OK, that it\'s acceptable. And what will happen then is that the group will start to hear new voices. And often it\'s one of these voices that can bring about a breakthrough. And so, in one of these meetings, we suddenly heard from a man who hadn\'t spoken. He shared his experience as a newcomer to Belfast, standing on a bus, exhausted after work, and suddenly being surrounded by a group of men. They came in really close, whispered horrible threats. They trapped him. And he explained how his heart pounded and he just gripped the railing of the bus and waited until it stopped and he could dash out. He had feared for his life that day, he told the group, and he had hoped that immigrating to Northern Ireland from Somalia would have been the end of having to fear for his life. The room fell totally quiet. Everyone heard him. Protestants, Catholics - suddenly it didn\'t matter. ""That\'s unacceptable,"" the first said. ""That\'s not Belfast,"" said the second. ""Not how we want it to be,"" says the third. Now, these are men who have taken lives, who have devastated many families, in some cases their own, and now they start finishing each other\'s sentences about tolerance, inclusion and respect, and this builds and builds in the room until finally, I can\'t resist the irony, and so I announce, ""Well, mission accomplished. Let\'s go to Disneyland!"" And they all turn and stare at me and start laughing, all of them. They laughed hard for minutes, and what that laughter gave way to was a deeper discussion than they\'d ever had before. They talked about what kind of future they all hoped for, for their kids and their grandkids. Now, here\'s the thing. Our man on the bus who experienced that terrifying moment, he might not have spoken if I had avoided the conflict, held forth with my own ideas and rushed to fill every silence. I moved toward the conflict. I didn\'t presume to know, which meant I kept asking questions. And for the most part, I kept quiet. These rules helped him to speak, and these rules helped the group to hear him, and in the end, his story was just what they needed to hear to move forward together. One conversation can change everything. I think of the corrections officer who said there\'s nothing normal about my job, and the opening that created for the group. I think of the moment when he and the gang leader, at the end of that meeting, embraced one another and how powerful they became as partners. I think of the men in Belfast who hid their faces in ski masks to bring great violence into each other\'s lives. Today they know each other\'s faces and first names; they were enemies and they\'re neighbors now. I think of the CEOs and health care leaders and technology innovators I\'ve seen transform their teams and reach their goals, all starting with one conversation. I think of the lives saved, the jobs created, the dreams achieved. So back to your conversation, the one that people around you really need to have, the one that you can lead. It can feel like a concrete maze the size of 72 football fields, but there\'s almost always a way through, and you\'ll find the way through by moving toward the conflict, asking questions and keeping quiet. Conversations create the future. Whether or not we have them and how we have them is up to us. Thank you.

""Hair, makeup and nails keep us strong and safe; does that make us sellouts? Or survivors?"" In her talk, Nef boldly investigates trans femininity, asking the question: Why are we shamed for being femme?",,,91894,2020-06-19T01:14:45+00:00,"['LGBT', 'social change', 'Transgender', 'gender', 'women', 'Gender spectrum', 'gender equality', 'identity', 'violence', 'culture']","['English', 'Español']",Hari Nef,,"{'0:00': 'Remember when Caitlyn Jenner revealed herself on the cover of ""Vanity Fair""? Yeah. (Laughter) I\'ve got a lot to say about her conservative politics and her bumpy advocacy, but this, this was cool. Most of you agreed with me. Not all of you, however. Like any woman in the public eye, Caitlyn\'s appearance in particular came under scrutiny. ""Caitlyn Jenner\'s idea of a woman is a cleavage-boosting corset, sultry poses, thick mascara, banter about hair and makeup; nail polish does not a woman make."" ""I feel slammed by the decision to portray Ms. Jenner on the cover of \'Vanity Fair\', as the stereotypical male fantasy of a woman. It\'s sexist, no matter who does it."" ""I fully support Caitlyn Jenner, but I wish she hadn\'t chosen to come out as a sex babe."" These quotations source from Elinor Burkett, Barbara Cohn Schlachet, and Susan Ager, non-trans women with roots in the second wave feminist movement of the 70s and early 80s. Their, perhaps dated, aesthetic preferences of feminist Liberalism clash with femme aesthetics; in this case, trans-femme aesthetics. But if you ask me, hair, makeup and nails don\'t make trans women like me or any women for that matter, bad feminists. Sure, what if Caitlyn had appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in a pantsuit with no makeup, her hair pulled back, arms crossed? I think she would\'ve looked really cool, but would we all have accepted her so readily as a woman? Would she have appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair to begin with? It\'s time for the aesthetics of upwardly mobile feminist respectability to make room for the aesthetics of survival, particularly trans survival. It\'s time to revise what a feminist looks like; especially if hair, makeup, and nails allow her to get jobs, make friends or ride the subway home safely at night. It\'s time to free the femme, because some of us need it or just like it, and that\'s OK. This charming 1979 text is called, ""The transsexual empire: the making of the she-male."" It was written by Elinor Burkett, a second wave radical feminist. The thesis of this text is essentially that: one, trans women aren\'t women; two, trans women are bad for feminist progress. Raymond confesses in the conclusion of the text that she hopes that with enough work, transsexuality - as she calls it - will eventually be morally mandated out of existence. In 1979, shortly after this book was published, Johns Hopkins, the first US medical institution to offer life-saving, gender confirmation surgery, phased out the procedure and dismantled its Gender Identity Committee after coming under fire in this text. Raymond hypothesizes, ""If the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about man-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries?"" I believe that Raymond\'s call for women to break real gender boundaries is a call we should answer. But do we we have to answer with our bodies? Is it our fault, if the dominant, man-made beauty ideals exclude the bodies that most of us were born with? And, is it bad, if we want to do something about that make a couple of changes? Because men are scary pigs, and patriarchy is real. (Applause) If hair, makeup, and nails, hormones even, If those things keep us strong and safe, then, I don\'t know. Does that make us sell-outs or survivors? Speaking of hair and makeup, I love Lana Del Rey! (Laughter) I love her so much. In a 2014 edition of The New Inquiry, my good friend Sarah Nicole Prickett analyzes the pop-star’s image. ""Two years ago, the prevailing male establishment appeared to not like Lana Del Rey one bit. The New York Times\' John Caramanica called her a poser, a meme, and a has-been suggesting that she could only try again after washing off that face paint and mussing up that hair. In other words, Lana Del Rey should have done a better job of passing, of being a \'natural woman.\'"" One, I relate. Are there any trans girls in the room? No? Ah, my stats were wrong. Passing as a natural woman can decide whether I have a good day or a bad day. It sucks, but it is what it is. Number two. Wow. Thirty-five years after the publication of ""The transsexual empire,"" Raymond\'s preferred femme-free aesthetics of second wave feminism have become the mainstream aesthetics expected by the bro-literati of women. Yikes. Prickett continues - Here\'s another picture of Del Rey; Whoops! Should I have shown you that? - that, ""Lana Del Rey\'s rejection of upwardly mobile feminism and/or high-class femininity in favor of fatalistic glamor makes her a gender deserter to some, but a godsend to most. When girls and women are meant to choose chic, studied effortlessness, Lana\'s truth is an alternative, a man-loving woman. Read \'man\' unliterally, as something big and impossible to get out from money, a whole damn country ..."" Under patriarchy, money and country inscribe themselves on women\'s bodies. We look in the mirror, and we ask ourselves, ""Do I look like a rich woman today?"" We look in the mirror and say, ""Do I look like an American woman today?"" We look in the mirror and say, ""Do I look like a beautiful woman today?"" And if I don\'t look rich, beautiful, and American, Am I still a woman? Lana Del Rey and Caitlyn Jenner merely fit the bill we were all charged, and I don\'t blame them for that. If the aesthetics of money and country are, as Prickett argues impossible to get out from, then, why are we being shamed for working it out underneath them? Here\'s a picture of me, before I started transitioning, or I had started transitioning but I hadn\'t started medical transition yet. At this point in my life, I wore a full face of makeup every day, I shaved my whole body every week which covered me in these angry red spots. I stopped cutting my hair. I wore dresses to morning classes. I started hormones: pills twice a day and a needle in my leg every week. I started going in for a monthly laser hair removal appointments, procedures that were so painful, that I had to chug a flask of vodka before every session just so I would feel it less. I starved myself and abused laxatives so I could fit the clothes I wanted to wear. I did all this because I wanted a body that allowed me to do the things I wanted to do in the way I wanted to do them. Things men in this country aren\'t really allowed to do. I tried to do them in the body I was born with, but people told me, ""No, you can\'t. ""You have to soften up your face, get rid of all your body hair; get breasts, shrink your waist, get a vagina."" Of course, I looked them right in the eye said, ""Fuck you,"" turned around, and did pretty much all of what they told me to do. (Laughter) It hurt, and it worked. If my story, or journey sounds difficult or tough, I can guarantee you, it\'s even more difficult and more tough for the vast majority of trans women. In 2002, a trans woman named Gwen Araujo was beaten and strangled to death by four men upon their discovery that Gwen, despite her femme appearance, was not assigned female at birth. In 2013, Islan Nettles was slaughtered under similar circumstances. In 2014, Jennifer Laude was slaughtered under similar circumstances by a US marine. In 2016, January, Monica Loera was slaughtered under similar circumstances. Worldwide, a trans person is slaughtered every three days. The vast majority of these victims are trans women of color, and the vast majority of the discovered murderers are men, dissatisfied with our embodiment of femininity, dissatisfied by trans femininity. Men who judge us to be not femme enough. It is so hard to gain access to hormones to jump through all the medical hoops. It is so expensive to buy cosmetics, new clothes, healthy food, any number of means towards body feminization. Even if a trans woman does manage to look or seem femme, her race, her class, or her citizenship can place further targets on her back. So, when it comes to trans women with limited resources, their femme can be the difference between life and death. So, I got to ask: why are we being shamed for our femme? Let femmes be femmes, if they want to be femme, because some of us need it or just want it, and that\'s OK. When the aesthetics of feminist respectability exclude and erase the women who need, not just want, need to give them up, then the aesthetics of feminist respectability need to change. Femme aesthetics aren\'t bad or good. They just work. They just are. They work for some of us. So, chill out. (Laughter) Let us live. Free the Femme. Thank you.

A slight adjustment of spelling, and rabota became the Czech robota, which, in addition to defining the toil of the serfs, was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery. In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called ""R.U.R."", short for ""Rossum\'s Universal Robots."" The story featured automated machines with distinctly human features that, until they revolt, catered to the whims of the people of Earth. Capek originally considered calling these hard-working machines labori from the Latin word for labor, but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly. He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state by naming them roboti, or robot in English. ""R.U.R."" was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923, the word robot was enthusiastically embraced.

Cyberware is unique in that it is not covered by existing legal framework and it often inspires more questions than we are yet capable of answering. Daniel Garrie ponders some of the practical and ethical dilemmas that may pop up as we progress towards our uncertain future.

Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war? As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws. So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios can you imagine falling under the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare, and how might you design an international legal framework to deter these activities?""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not that simple. Sleep scientist Matt Walker takes us into the eye-opening ways that these drinks affect the quantity and quality of our sleep.",0:04:55,4.916666667,93804,2020-07-22T14:12:49+00:00,"['sleep', 'science', 'health', 'human body']","['English', 'Français', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Türkçe', 'فارسى', 'हिन्दी', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ']",Matt Walker,"Sleep scientist, professor, author","{'00:06': 'Many of us like to start the day with a cup of coffee and perhaps end the day with a glass of wine or some other kind of alcoholic drink. But it turns out that these two substances, alcohol and caffeine, can have surprising impacts on our sleep.', '00:22': '[Sleeping with Science]', '00:25': '(Contemplative music)', '00:27': ""Let's start with caffeine. Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call the psychoactive stimulants. And everyone knows that caffeine can make them more alert. It can wake them up. But there are at least two additional, hidden features of caffeine that some people may not be aware of."", '00:48': ""The first is the duration of action of caffeine. Caffeine, for the average adult, will have what we call a half-life of about five to six hours. What that means is that after about five to six hours 50 percent of that caffeine that you had is still circulating in your system. What that also means is that caffeine has a quarter-life of about 10 to 12 hours. In other words, let's say that you have a cup of coffee at 2pm in the evening. It could be that almost a quarter of that caffeine is still swilling around in your brain at midnight. And as a result, it can make it harder for an individual to fall asleep or even stay asleep soundly throughout the night. So that's the first feature of caffeine."", '01:41': ""The second issue with caffeine is that it can change the quality of your sleep. Now some people will tell me that I'm one of those individuals who can have an espresso with dinner, and I fall asleep fine, and I can stay asleep. But even if that's true, it turns out that caffeine can actually decrease the amount of deep, non-rapid eye movement sleep that we have, stages three and four of non-REM sleep. That's that sort of restorative deep sleep. And as a consequence, you can wake up the next morning, and you don't feel refreshed, you don't feel restored by your sleep. But you don't remember waking up, you don't remember struggling to fall asleep, so you don't make the connection, but nevertheless you may then find yourself reaching for two cups of coffee in the morning to wake up rather than one."", '02:34': ""So that's caffeine, but now let's move on to alcohol, because alcohol is perhaps one of the most misunderstood sleep aids out there. In fact, it's anything but a sleep aid. And it can be problematic for your sleep in at least three different ways."", '02:53': ""First, alcohol is in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives. But sedation is not sleep. And studies teach us that those two things are really quite different. Sedation is a case where we're simply switching off the firing of the brain cells, particularly in the cortex. And that's not natural sleep. In fact, during deep non-rapid eye movement sleep, for example, the brain has this remarkable coordination of hundreds of thousands of cells that all of a sudden fire together, and then they all go silent, and then they all fire together, and then they go silent, producing these big, powerful brainwaves of deep non-REM sleep. And so that's the first way in which alcohol can be problematic. We're mistaking sedation for deep sleep."", '03:46': 'The second problem with alcohol is that it can actually fragment your sleep. Alcohol can actually trigger and activate during sleep what we call the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which will therefore wake you up more frequently throughout the night. And alcohol can even increase the amount of alerting chemicals that are released by the brain, once again fragmenting your sleep.', '04:12': ""The third and final issue with alcohol and sleep is that alcohol can actually block your rapid eye movement sleep, or your dream sleep. And as we'll learn in subsequent episodes, REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, dream sleep, provides a collection of benefits, things such as your emotional and mental health, even creativity."", '04:36': ""Now I'm not here to tell anyone how to live. I don't want to be puritanical. I'm just a scientist. What I want to try and do is provide you with the information about the relationship between caffeine and alcohol on your sleep so then you can make an informed choice as to how best you want to live your life when you're trying to prioritize your sleep health.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And by understanding a little bit more about what sleep is, perhaps we can get the chance to improve both the quantity and the quality of our sleep.', '00:24': '[Sleeping with Science]', '00:26': '(Gentle music)', '00:29': 'So, exactly what is sleep? Well, sleep, at least in human beings, is subdivided into two main types. On the one hand, we have non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM sleep for short. But on the other hand, we have rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep.', '00:48': 'And non-REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages, unimaginatively called stages one through four, increasing in their depth of sleep. And as we go into those light stages of non-REM sleep, your heart rate starts to decrease, your body temperature starts to drop and your electrical brain wave activity starts to slow down.', '01:13': 'But as we move into deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep, stages three and four, now all of a sudden the brain erupts with these huge, big, powerful brain waves. The body is actually recharged in terms of its immune system. We also get this beautiful overhaul of our cardiovascular system. And, in fact, upstairs in the brain, deep non-REM sleep will help consolidate memories and fixate them into the neural architecture of the brain.', '01:45': ""So that's non-REM sleep. But let's come on to REM sleep, which is the other main type of sleep. And it's during REM sleep when we principally have the most vivid, the most hallucinogenic types of dreams. The brain wave activity actually starts to speed up again. It's during REM sleep that we receive almost a form of emotional first aid. And it's also during REM sleep where we get a boost for creativity, that it stitches information together so that we wake up with solutions to previously difficult problems that we were facing."", '02:24': ""Coming back to these two types of sleep, it turns out that non-REM and REM will play out in a battle for brain domination throughout the night, and that cerebral war is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes, and then it's going to be replayed every 90 minutes. And what this produces is a standard cycling architecture of human sleep, a standard 90-minute cycle."", '02:52': ""But what's different, however, is that the ratio of non-REM to REM within those 90-minute cycles changes as we move across the night, such that in the first half the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep, particularly stages three and four of non-REM sleep. But as we push through to the second half of the night, now that seesaw balance actually shifts over, and instead, most of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of a lot more rapid eye movement sleep, or dream sleep, as well as stage-two non-REM sleep, that lighter form of non-REM sleep."", '03:36': ""And it turns out that there are implications for understanding how sleep is structured in this way. Let's take someone who typically goes to bed at 10pm, and they wake up at 6am, so they have an eight-hour sleep window. But this morning, they have to wake up early for an early morning meeting, or they want to get a jump start on the day to get to the gym. And as a consequence, they have to wake up at 4am in the morning, rather than 6am in the morning. How much sleep have they actually lost? Two hours out of an eight-hour night of sleep means that they've lost 25 percent of their sleep. Well, yes and no. They have lost 25 percent of all of their sleep, but because REM sleep comes mostly in the second half of the night and particularly in those last few hours, they may have lost perhaps 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent of all of their REM sleep."", '04:36': ""So there are real consequences to understanding what sleep is and how sleep is structured. And we'll learn all about the benefits of these different stages of sleep and the detriments that happen when we don't get enough of them in subsequent episodes.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A young man is wheeled in before you, lying unconscious on a gurney. He's been shot in the leg and is bleeding profusely. Judging from the entry and exit wounds, as well as the amount of hemorrhaging, the bullet most likely clipped the femoral artery, one of the largest blood vessels in the body. As the young man's doctor, what should you do? Or more precisely, what should you do first?"", '00:41': ""You look at the young man's clothes, which seem old and worn. He may be jobless, homeless, lacking a decent education. Do you start treatment by finding him a job, getting him an apartment or helping him earn his GED? On the other hand, this young man has been involved in some sort of conflict and may be dangerous. Before he wakes up, do you place him in restraints, alert hospital security or call 911? Most of us wouldn't do any of these things. And instead, we would take the only sensible and humane course of action available at the time. First, we would stop the bleeding. Because unless we stop the bleeding, nothing else matters."", '01:26': 'What\'s true in the emergency room is true for cities all around the country. When it comes to urban violence, the first priority is to save lives. Treating that violence with the same urgency that we would treat a gunshot wound in the ER. What are we talking about when we say ""urban violence""? Urban violence is the lethal or potentially lethal violence that happens on the streets of our cities. It goes by many names: street violence, youth violence, gang violence, gun violence. Urban violence happens among the most disadvantaged and disenfranchised among us. Mostly young men, without a lot of options or much hope.', '02:08': ""I have spent hundreds of hours with these young men. I've taught them at a high school in Washington DC, where one of my students was murdered. I've stood across form them in courtrooms in New York City, where I worked as a prosecutor. And finally, I've gone from city to city as a policymaker and as a researcher, meeting with these young men and exchanging ideas on how to make our communities safer. Why should we care about these young men? Why does urban violence matter?"", '02:40': 'Urban violence matters, because it causes more deaths here in the United States than any other form of violence. Urban violence also matters because we can actually do something about it. Controlling it is not the impossible, intractable challenge that many believe it to be. In fact, there are a number of solutions available today that are proven to work. And what these solutions have in common is one key ingredient. They all recognize that urban violence is sticky, meaning that it clusters together among a surprisingly small number of people and places.', '03:18': 'In New Orleans, for instance, a network of fewer than 700 individuals accounts for the majority of the city\'s lethal violence. Some call these individuals ""hot people."" Here in Boston, 70 percent of shootings are concentrated on blocks and corners covering just five percent of the city. These locations are often known as ""hot spots."" In city after city, a small number of hot people and hot spots account for the clear majority of lethal violence. In fact, this finding has been replicated so many times that researchers now call this phenomenon the law of crime concentration.', '03:56': ""When we look at the science, we see that sticky solutions work best. To put it bluntly, you can't stop shootings if you won't deal with shooters. And you can't stop killings if you won't go where people get killed."", '04:13': 'Four years ago, my colleagues and I performed a systematic meta-review of antiviolence strategies, summarizing the results of over 1,400 individual impact evaluations. What we found, again and again, was that the strategies that were the most focused, the most targeted, the stickiest strategies, were the most successful. We saw this in criminology, in studies of policing, gang prevention and reentry. But we also saw this in public health, where targeted tertiary and secondary prevention performed better than more generalized primary prevention. When policymakers focus on the most dangerous people and places, they get better results.', '04:57': ""What about replacement and displacement, you might ask. Research shows that when drug dealers are locked up, new dealers step right in, replacing those that came before. Some worry that when police focus on certain locations, crime will be displaced, moving down the street or around the corner. Fortunately, we know now that because of the stickiness phenomenon, the replacement and displacement effects associated with these sticky strategies are minimal. It takes a lifetime of trauma to create a shooter and decades of disinvestment to create a hot spot. So these people and places don't move around easily."", '05:41': ""What about root causes? Isn't addressing poverty or inequality or lack of opportunity the best way to prevent violence? Well, according to the science, yes and no. Yes, in that high rates of violence are clearly associated with various forms of social and economic disadvantage. But no, in that changes in these factors do not necessarily result in changes in violence, especially not in the short run. Take poverty, for instance. Meaningful progress on poverty will take decades to achieve, while poor people need and deserve relief from violence right now. Root causes also can't explain the stickiness phenomenon. If poverty always drove violence, then we would expect to see violence among all poor people. But we don't see that."", '06:27': 'Instead, we can empirically observe that poverty concentrates, crime concentrates further still and violence concentrates most of all. That is why sticky solutions work. They work, because they deal with first things first. And this is important, because while poverty may lead to violence, strong evidence shows that violence actually perpetuates poverty.', '06:54': ""Here's just one example of how. As documented by Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist -- he showed that when poor children are exposed to violence, it traumatizes them. It impacts their ability to sleep, to pay attention, to behave and to learn. And if poor children can't learn, then they can't do well in school. And that ultimately impacts their ability to earn a paycheck later in life that is large enough to escape poverty."", '07:22': ""And unfortunately, in a series of landmark studies by economist Raj Chetty, that is exactly what we've seen. Poor children exposed to violence have lower income mobility than poor children who grow up peacefully. Violence literally traps poor kids in poverty. That is why it is so important to focus relentlessly on urban violence. Here are two examples of how."", '07:48': 'Here in Boston, in the 1990s, a partnership between cops and community members achieved a stunning 63 percent reduction in youth homicide. In Oakland, that same strategy recently reduced nonfatal gun assaults by 55 percent. In Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Haven, it cut gun violence by more than a third. At its simplest, this strategy simply identifies those who are most likely to shoot or be shot, and then confronts them with a double message of empathy and accountability. ""We know it\'s you that\'s doing the shooting. It must stop. If you let us, we will help you. If you make us, we will stop you."" Those willing to change are offered services and support. Those who persist in their violent behavior are brought to justice via targeted law enforcement action.', '08:44': ""In Chicago, another program uses cognitive behavioral therapy to help teenage boys manage difficult thoughts and emotions, by teaching them how to avoid or mitigate conflicts. This program reduced violent crime arrests among participants by half. Similar strategies have reduced criminal reoffending by 25 to 50 percent. Now Chicago has launched a new effort, using these same techniques, but with those at the highest risk for gun violence. And the program is showing promising results. What's more, because these strategies are so focused, so targeted, they tend not to cost much in absolute terms. And they work with the laws already on the books today."", '09:28': ""So that's the good news. We can have peace in our cities, right now, without big budgets and without new laws. So why hasn't this happened yet? Why are these solutions still limited to a small number of cities, and why do they struggle, even when successful, to maintain support? Well, that's the bad news. The truth is, we have not been very good at organizing our efforts around this phenomenon of stickiness."", '09:59': ""There are at least three reasons why we don't follow the evidence when it comes to urban violence reduction. And the first, as you might expect, is politics. Most sticky solutions don't conform to one political platform or another. Instead, they offer both carrots and sticks, balancing the promise of treatment with the threat of arrest, combining place-based investment with hot-spots policing. In other words, these solutions are both soft and tough at the same time. Because they don't line up neatly with the typical talking points of either the Left or the Right, politicians won't gravitate to these ideas without some education, and maybe even a little pressure. It won't be easy, but we can change the politics around these issues by reframing violence as a problem to be solved, not an argument to be won. We should emphasize evidence over ideology and what works versus what sounds good."", '11:00': ""The second reason why we don't always follow the evidence is the somewhat complicated nature of these solutions. There is an irony here. What are the simplest ways to reduce violence? More cops. More jobs. Fewer guns. These are easy to spell out, but they tend not to work as well in practice. While on the other hand, research-based solutions are harder to explain, but get better results. Right now, we have a lot of professors writing about violence in academic journals. And we have a lot of people keeping us safe out on the street. But what we don't have is a lot of communication between these two groups. We don't have a strong bridge between research and practice. And when research actually does inform practice, that bridge is not built by accident. It happens when someone takes the time to carefully explain what the research means, why it's important and how it can actually make a difference in the field. We spend plenty of time creating research, but not enough breaking it down into bite-sized bits that a busy cop or social worker can easily digest."", '12:12': ""It may be difficult to acknowledge or accept, but race is the third and final reason why more has not been done to reduce violence. Urban violence concentrates among poor communities of color. That makes it easy for those of us who don't live in those communities to ignore the problem or pretend it's not ours to solve. That is wrong, of course. Urban violence is everyone's problem. Directly or indirectly, we all pay a price for the shootings and killings that happen on the streets of our cities. That is why we need to find new ways to motivate more people to cross class and color lines to join this struggle. Because these strategies are not resource-intensive, we don't need to motivate many new allies -- we just need a few. And we just need them to be loud."", '13:04': ""If we can overcome these challenges and spread these sticky solutions to the neighborhoods that need them, we could save thousands of lives. If the strategies I've discussed here today were implemented right now in the nation's 40 most violent cities, we could save over 12,000 souls over the next eight years."", '13:26': 'How much would it cost? About 100 million per year. That might sound like a lot, but in fact, that figure represents less than one percent of one percent of the annual federal budget. The Defense Department spends about that much for a single F-35 fighter jet.', '13:44': ""Metaphorically, the treatment is the same, whether it's a young man suffering from a gunshot wound, a community riddled with such wounds, or a nation filled with such communities. In each case, the treatment, first and foremost, is to stop the bleeding. I know this can work. I know it, because I've seen it. I've seen shooters put down their guns and devote their lives to getting others to do the same. I've walked through housing projects that were notorious for gunfire and witnessed children playing outside. I've sat with cops and community members who used to hate one another, but now work together. And I've seen people from all walks of life, people like you, finally decide to get involved in this struggle. And that's why I know that together, we can and we will end this senseless slaughter."", '14:42': 'Thank you.', '14:43': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Laughter) But for any of this to make sense, I first need to confess something to you, something that might not be obvious just by looking at me. My name\'s Lucy, and I\'m a sensible grown-up. I work hard. I\'m a decent mother and a responsible member of my community. But I much prefer dressing up as someone else. You see, I have always loved fancy dress. And since this picture - (Laughter) But since this picture was taken, I\'ve ramped things up a bit. I\'ve commissioned made-to-measure armor from a workshop in the Ukraine, imported professional Hollywood blood. I\'ve nurtured a collection of 36 tiaras. I\'ve had a fake wedding, complete with fake bridesmaids, fake vicar, fake husband. I hospitalized myself once after an incident with a Roman toga and some very hot glue. (Laughter) And I once sent my son to school looking like this. (Laughter) Now, the kind of fancy dress that I love is not the same as cosplay with its discipline and immersiveness and accuracy. They\'re the real deal. But what I adore is the peculiar eccentricity of cardboard cut-outs, dodgy sewing, stapled seams. It\'s kitchen-table couture. The for-one-night-only aspect, falling into bed drunk and danced out and still wearing the face paint. And there\'s nothing disciplined about that. So in order to have more fancy dress in my life - because, honestly, it\'s awful - you can\'t do it in supermarkets or on average Wednesdays. So I created a podcast about it. The only podcast about fashion, fantasy, and fancy dress. Or costumes, as they prefer to call it in the US. It\'s a place to explore the elaborate themes, intricacies, and influence of costume in real life. Because I\'m interested in the distinction between the performative and the personal. Ordinary people in extraordinary outfits. And what struck me more than any other subject we\'ve encountered on the show is the way people use costume as a tool for protest. Now, you might be thinking, ""What does dressing up have to do with the important business of politics?"" (Laughter) And it does seem counterintuitive. Why dress silly in order to be taken seriously? But from caped crusaders to modern suffragettes, people are getting creative with costume to express their outrage and garner global attention. And it\'s working. It\'s worth saying here that fashion is often treated as a flimsy, generally female distraction from the real issues of the day, and despite being a three-trillion-dollar industry, it\'s often marginalized or dismissed in commentary about current affairs. And yet, every day each one of us uses what we wear as a tool for constructing our sense of self, for literally fashioning our identities. If fashion is considered frivolous, then fancy dress is really frivolous. Right? But actually, it allows us to express the most extreme version of ourselves. It allows us to be something other. Something in-between, something in development. And historically, it\'s always had a relationship with hot topics. Here\'s a gown by Worth worn by Mrs. Vanderbilt in 1883, representing the spirit of electricity. More recently, there\'s been a decidedly less beautiful trend for dressing as the Millennial\'s favorite, the avocado. (Laughter) Sorry. (Laughter) Over the years, fancy dress has playfully depicted controversial moments, from this matchgirl factory-strike dress to Urban Outfitter\'s Halloween ""Influencer"" costume. It\'s satire and disruption and provocation. So I\'m going to take us beyond slogan T-shirts to look at the ways bonkers subversive garments are being used to take on the establishment. Here, we can see an anarchic continuity from gunpowder plot through to Occupy Wall Street. These masks taken from the comic book ""V for Vandetta,"" are used as a public face of the anonymous movement. They\'re a variation on a Guy Folks theme, and they hark back to ancient carnivals and masquerades where the usual societal rules don\'t apply, and everything is temporarily topsy-turvy. Here, ""Handmaid\'s Tale"" costumes are appropriated for demonstrations against the Trump administration, and we saw a lot at the Kavanaugh hearings - taking a moment in fiction from Margaret Atwood\'s 1985 dystopia, and applying it to a very current conflict, lines of silent, highly visible women outside courtrooms and the Capitol. Hilariously, later, in a complete misjudgment of the cultural mood, the retailer Yandy prompted wide-spread disgust when they launched a sexy version of the Handmaid. (Laughter) I don\'t think they\'d read the novel. (Laughter) Elsewhere, the visual language of the suffragettes is borrowed from new battle, purple for dignity, white for purity, green for hope. Powerful Pantones and a pre-hashtag way of building momentum. Sentiments like ""Same shit, different century"" are rendered ever so lady-like. (Laughter) The campaign group Fathers for Justice uses a range of costumes in their stunts from Batman to Santa. Clear statements in a contentious debate. By using classic icons of good, by hijacking the visual grammar of superheroism, they\'re trying to invoke an almost an instinctive, nostalgic, sympathetic response in the viewer. The Pink Pussyhat Project took a traditional domestic skill and rendered it the opposite of calm or comforting. This open-source knitting pattern, this moment of craftivism - originally conceived the people who wanted to march but couldn\'t - was quickly embraced by women\'s activists all over the world. Sarah Mower called it a global cheerful symbol of feminist defiance in British Vogue, and it\'s considered so important a moment in fashion history that the V&amp;A\'s brilliantly titled Rapid Response Collection have already acquired one. Now, imagine if you took the costumes away in all these examples. If they were just standing there in jeans and anoraks. What does that do the occasion, the atmosphere, the news cycle? Each of these examples uses cultural referencing to make a statement without saying a word. It\'s free speech without speech, the messages writ large on the body. And how do you express your feelings about issues that are so complex, so shifting, so delicate, so divisive that sometimes language eludes even the very best of us? I just love her face in that picture. (Laughter) At a time when the words of experts are ridiculed and critics are trolled, when fake news rebrands truth as fiction, perhaps we need tools that are beyond language to securely assert our values. I think there\'s a link between fancy dress and ambition. It\'s why we love it growing up. You can be a ballet dancer and a firefighter, all in the same afternoon. But for the game to work, you have to do more than just put the clothes on. You need to aspire into those costumes. Fancy dress isn\'t just a tool to passively join in, but an opportunity to project our future selves, our hopes. And I believe there\'s a relationship between the way we dress and how brave we feel. I know that because it took me weeks to decide what to wear today. (Laughter) Perhaps, dressing up gives us courage to behave in ways we wouldn\'t otherwise. Here are some extreme illustrations of that. During the American Civil War, Frances Clayton dressed as a male soldier, becoming Jack Williams. She fought with the Missouri Regiment in 17 battles before her identity was revealed. She used uniform first to disguise her gender, second as armor, a layering of costume that allowed her to elude the male gaze and instead train her eye to fight alongside them. Which, I wonder, was the more dangerous? By wearing her warrior status, Frances was dressing up in order to be allowed in. A whole life born out of those clothes. The women of the 18th century often used the masquerades as an opportunity to elope or escape. Being masked and unchaperoned gave them an unusual freedom, a socially sanctioned moment of disguise to pursue a life beyond the one ascribed to them. The mask made them dangerous and daring. We know how extreme the psychology of this can be because the worst imaginable atrocities have been committed masked and in a kind of costume. A corrupt courage. Cloaked and criminal. A group united as a chilling icon of hatred. Costume isn\'t intrinsically innocent. And a disguise can free an innermost evil, too. Costume for unity can be seen in a completely different way here: where it says, ""She is getting married, so we\'re having organized compulsory fun."" (Laughter) We\'ve all been there. Or here, at the State of the Union, where it says we are part of an empowered tradition honoring the suffragettes\' legacy. Simply put, when an activist puts their identity alongside a placard, they show that they, as an individual, express a view. If they want to connect it with a wider movement, they can use a signifier, like the suffragette colors or the ""hi-viz"" vests of the French ""Gilets jaunes."" It\'s tribal. Whereas in fancy dress, the costume subsumes the individual entirely into the view they\'re expressing. It\'s as if, bizarrely, when someone is concealed, their true values become completely visible. The arresting protest images I\'ve shown you today, and of course there are many more, all, unequivocally, communicate collective hopes. By protesting in costume, these people are giving voice to their democratic right to imagine a potential future, to identify with each other, and to express their freedom. So costume has real potential to challenge and confront, for disruption and dissent. By dressing outside ourselves, we trick the eye, attract the focus, demand recognition. We creatively tell the people in power that we\'re not comfortable conforming, that the collective issue is bigger than our personal perspective. Fancy dress is not bound by who you are or how you identify but by the message you want to embody. And those messages aren\'t constrained by the limits of your experience or your environment. Only by your imagination. And we have to imagine our utopias before we can build them. It is imagination that sells thousands of cheap and cheerful Marilyn Monroe dresses every year. Imagination that sends kids to school clutching Harry Potter wands, and sales figures for grotesque rubber presidential candidate masks have correctly predicted U.S. election outcomes since Nixon. Isn\'t he handsome there? (Laughter) Unlike any other kind of getting dressed, fancy dress is fundamentally about infinite possibility. That\'s why we keep it alive, even when technology offers up far more sophisticated vehicles for experimenting or escapism. We still throw another party, hand down our treasured dressing-up boxes, those time capsules of ideas and interpretations. So if dressing together as one brilliant rainbow crew gives you a sense of strength and belonging, a palette just about big enough to celebrate your pride, then use all the colors. Or if you wake up one morning thinking Brexit is a job for Wonderwoman ... (Laughter) you might be right. Or if you\'re moved to rise up in solidarity in a crowd of pink hats that say in glorious, loving shorthand how your body is equal, how it is not there for grabbing, how it belongs fiercely to yourself, then get knitting. Just as children dressing as astronauts aren\'t trying out a future career, they\'re playing with an alternative reality. So we can use the freedom of fancy dress to communicate an imagined, better version of our lives. Because fancy dress says, ""This tawdry reality isn\'t good enough for me."" Think of it as dressing up for the job you want, not the job you have. Or for turning one night only into a blueprint for a magical tomorrow, too. Lets remember, fancy dress has a grown-up role to play beyond stag parties and Halloweens. Its principles even have a place at the State Opening of Parliament and the State of the Union. From full get-up to subtle signifiers, this is about being emboldened. Massive movements are born of micro demonstrations. Things that seem trivial or frivolous can be potent symbols of what you stand for, or what you won\'t stand for. There\'s real power in putting on those knitted ears, in choosing to wear a cape for good versus evil. Fancy dress has a unifying quality that we can use to fight for change, armed only with glue guns and gumption. And if costume makes up braver, it gives us the courage to explore imaginative alternatives. The courage not just to turn up but to be noticed. So I hope we never grow out of it. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) (Whistles)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as neuroscientist and operatic soprano Indre Viskontas points out, we know very little about how the brain turns strings of sounds into music. In a talk that explores art with science, she describes how her investigation into the brain's responses to music inspired her own musical journey.",,,68067,2019-08-19T20:27:21+00:00,"['science', 'music', 'art', 'brain', 'neuroscience']","['English', 'Español', 'Italiano', 'Magyar']",Indre Viskontas,Professor of Neuroscience and of music,"{'0:00': 'Music isn\'t music until your brain makes it so. Sounds can be noise in one context and music in another. We can all tell when someone is speaking vs. when they\'re singing, but as Diana Deutsch discovered if you take a spoken sentence, pull out a phrase, repeat that phrase over and over and over again, it will begin to sound musical. Then, if you listen to the entire sentence again, it will sound as if the person bursts into song when he or she gets to the repeated part. But the sounds reaching your ear are the same in all of those cases; what\'s changed is your brain. How the brain turns sound into music remains one of the greatest mysteries of neuroscience. The vast majority of us love some kind of music; If you don\'t, you are very rare and scientists will want to study you. We call you a person with ""amusia"" - a cool new name. We don\'t all love the same music. Personally, I\'m not a huge fan of smooth jazz, and you might not like opera. This characteristic of music, the fact that it\'s universally loved, but highly subjective, has ensured that it continues to baffle us. We all need certain things to survive and reproduce: food, water, sex. Our minds have evolved in such a way that when we don\'t have those things, we seek them out. They become enjoyable; we call them ""biological reinforcers."" But music is just a bunch of sounds strung together, it doesn\'t provide us with the essential nutrients; it doesn\'t bind to our neurons the way drugs do; it doesn\'t ensure that our genes live on although that might be debatable. Why do we love music? It\'s a question I\'ve struggled to answer, and I can\'t promise you a full, complete solution today, but I like to share with you some of the scientific insights that had made me a better musician, and some of the artistic insights I hope will help neuroscientists solve this mystery. I come from a family of physicians: two anesthesiologists, a gastroenterologist, a generalist, an orthopedic surgeon, an ophthalmic surgeon, and an ER doctor. Thanksgiving dinner at our house is the safest place to be outside of the hospital. (Laughter) so I can\'t guarantee it\'s the most fun. Then there is my mother; she is a conductor, much to my two-year old son\'s dismay, not of the locomotive kind but very much of the music kind. Growing up, I saw how difficult it is to make a living as a musician in a society where music is universally loved but hopelessly undervalued. She works long hours, she still sacrifices every holiday, and there is a part of her that never stops wondering what people thought of her last performance. If you count up all the awards, the recognitions, and distinctions, she\'s by far, the most successful member of our family, but she certainly wouldn\'t think so. Not that being a doctor isn\'t stressful - it is - but at the end of the day, you\'ve spent your time trying to extend or enhance a person\'s life, and who can argue the value of that? So when it was my turn to decide what to do with my professional life, the choice seemed pretty straight forward: go to medical school, and in your free time, continue up your musical training. But then I watched my brother trained to become an orthopedic surgeon, and I realized there is no such thing as free time in med school and especially in the years that follow. I didn\'t want to give up the most important years of my vocal training. I also couldn\'t see how I could support myself and pay for those expensive singing lessons if I didn\'t have some other way to make money. So I turned to neuroscience. To me, it was the a perfect blend of science and poetry. Like pretty much every other neuroscientist of my generation, I devoured the writings of Oliver Sacks; I studied topics like autobiographical memory, analogical reasoning, creativity. So you\'d think then I\'d turn to science to help me become a better musician. After all, if I was using science to understand something as elusive as insight, wouldn\'t it make sense to turn there to learn the things that I loved? But the truth is the more I looked at anatomical drawings of the larynx, the tongue, and the diaphragm, the less I felt I understood about my instrument; I couldn\'t see how knowing what parts of the brain were active or even enhanced in musicians would make me sing better. For a while, I even tried very hard to give up singing, because, after all, there are so many great singers in the world. We all need to get one-on-one care from a physician, but many hundreds of thousands of us can be moved by the same musician. So wouldn\'t I, and maybe the world, be better off if I stuck to medical research? The problem was that the more time I let elapse between singing engagements, the more I felt there was something really important missing from my life. The more I felt that I couldn\'t be the person I needed to be, I became moody, irritable, a little irrational, often mean; and I found too often I would cap off a difficult day in the lab with a martini or two and an hour of self-loathing. So when I finished my neuroscience PhD, I decided to dedicate myself full time to music; I enrolled in a Master\'s of Music program. Classical musical training follows the apprenticeship model where you study with one or two teachers for many years until you can produce the sounds that you hear in your imagination on your instrument. But the one thing that kept gnawing at me over and over again was how little neuroscience had trickled down into this model. After all, most of the techniques are built upon performing the same exercises over and over and over again, often, in the same way, everyday; until you build those skills. To demonstrate this, I want to introduce to you one of my favorite collaborators, Keisuke Nakagoshi. (Applause) Keisuke is going to give us an example of what a typical piano training exercise sounds like. (Piano music starts) (Piano music ends) Over and over and over again! But the truth is if you want to take what you\'re learning, what you\'re developing in that skill, and apply it to any piece of music, research in motor learning suggests that you should in fact interleave and space out your trials introducing some randomness - what we call ""desirable difficulties."" There is even a study of pianists demonstrating this effect, but so many teachers have never heard of such a thing. So then I began to wonder, ""What would happen if I actually try it on myself?"" as most scientists use themselves as guinea pigs, and I found that I started to improve much more rapidly. So I developed a course called Training the Musical Brain; how to use neuroscience to develop more effective practice strategies which I now teach at the Conservatory of Music here in San Francisco. I started to wonder, ""Are there other ways that science can make me a better musician that I couldn\'t see ten years ago?"" When I was a child, I remember one of my evaluations at the Royal Conservatory of Music; it\'ll always stick with me. I was a kid, I sang all my pieces well, I didn\'t make any mistakes, the judges said my tone was very good, I had good technique, but my performance was deemed ""unmusical."" I was devastated. How could these judges gauge my musicality? Couldn\'t they see that I feel and understand this music deeply? But the truth is feeling the music and producing music other people feel are two different skills. In the rehearsal room, I can cry as much as I need to when my character is dying, but when I get on stage, it\'s your time to cry not mine. So what could science tell me about that? That\'s when my two worlds collided; because after all, art and science are after the same thing: the goal is to understand the human experience. Science does it by extracting general principles about the world, and art uses individual experience to highlight what\'s universal. So here is what I learned in a nutshell: your brain is primed to search for meaning, for patterns, in a random, chaotic world. We look for these things everywhere, and we\'ve evolved in such a way that it\'s enjoyable when we make a new connection, when we learn something new, when we understand something meaningful. We find pleasure in it. We see things that are meaningful to us even when they are not there. We see faces everywhere; they are important to us. We anthropomorphize or attribute human-like traits to our pets, or cars, or digital devices. When we hear repeated sounds, and we know what they mean, we call it music. Speech becomes song just by repetition. In fact, repetition is the one quality of music that seems to be common across all cultures and genres, even in the one genre in which it\'s explicitly avoided - we call this classical contemporary music composition."" Elizabeth Margulis found if you artificially insert repetition into these pieces, people find them more enjoyable, more interesting, more likely to be rated as having been composed by a human being rather than a computer. Why? Because repetition signals intention, it frames the pattern, it shows you that there is something meaningful here to listen to. But that\'s not enough to explain a human obsession. After all, music can cause riots, topple governments, raise the hairs on the back of your neck. What can science tell us about that? It turns out that when your brain is enjoying a piece of music that might even give you the chills, it\'s awash with a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine, despite its widespread fame, has actually been undersold in many ways; people think of it as the ""pleasure chemical,"" but that\'s not all it does. A better term for it is the ""salience chemical,"" because it\'s awash in some parts of your brain when you\'re trying to hold important things in mind, when you\'re nauseated, when you want something, when there is a meaning to be found. The way that dopamine\'s awash in the brain while you\'re getting the chills from music is very specific to when and where it happens. There\'s a paper from Robert Zatorre\'s lab at McGill with Valorie Salimpoor, the first author that documents these changes and showed me, finally, what it means to be musical. Even as a master\'s student, I self-doubted my ability to sing musically; it was a bit like being cool: everyone seemed to know what it was and how to do it, but if you even asked the question, it showed that you weren\'t cool. I guess the fact I turned to science for help puts the nail in the coffin of my coolness. (Laughter) Even though in the practice room, I\'d spend almost all my time perfecting my high notes, after all, that\'s what gets you hired. They come at the climax of the piece; they get the biggest reaction from the audience; and if you screw them up, they are the most memorable. But my singing teacher would say to me, ""It\'s all the notes that are leading up to the high note that are more important than the high note, and that\'s what you should practice."" I understood that from a technical perspective but not from a musical one until I read the Salimpoor paper. In the Salimpoor paper, they show that there are two regions of the brain that mediate getting the chills from music and they tracked dopamine in these regions. They are the caudate and the nucleus accumbens. You can think of the caudate as your parent: it tells you that your behavior has consequences, it tracks how the things that you see, hear, observe, and do have outcomes; it sets up the expectation of a reward of pleasure and ensures, in the future, you will behave in such a way that you will seek reward and avoid the things that led to punishment. The caudate is awash with dopamine when you are leading up to the special moment that will give you the chills. But when you get to the moment that give you the chills, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens. Your nucleus accumbens is your BFF, it\'s your best friend for life, because more dopamine in the nucleus accumbens correlates with a bigger high. In the 1950s, Olds and Milner stuck electrodes into the nucleus accumbens of a bunch of rats. Then, they taught those rats to press the lever; and every time they pressed the lever, they\'d get a little electric current that stimulates their nucleus accumbens. Those rats wanted nothing more than to press that lever. One rat pressed it 7,500 times in 12 hours, suggesting that it would starve rather than stop pressing. The nucleus accumbens likes, but the caudate wants. The intensity of the chills that you feel from music depends on how much dopamine there is in your nucleus accumbens, but the number of times you get the chills or, if you get them at all, depends on the amount of dopamine in your caudate. That\'s what I learned, that\'s what it means to be musical. You need to set up the musical intention for your audience so that they will pay attention, so that the caudate will know that there is a reward to be had, and we better pay attention. Then, as a musician, you use all kinds of tools, once you\'ve set up the tension, to delay it, to delay the release. There\'s all kinds of music tools you can use to increase the desire, the expectation, the motivation for the reward, because, after all, pleasure is the death of desire. But the more desire there is, the better the pleasure. That\'s what I learned. So let me demonstrate to you this little theory in practice. One of my favorite opera is ""La Traviata"" by Verdi. It tells the story of a Parisian courtesan, a high class prostitute, who is dying of tuberculosis, as lots of sopranos do. (Laughter) She is entertaining a lavish party because she\'s giving everybody pleasure. That\'s what she does for a living, she gives pleasure, and she gets exhausted by the party; but at the party, she meets this young man who has been sitting outside her window while she was ill, unable to give pleasure when all her friends had abandoned her, and he was waiting for her because he really loved her. And now, alone in her room, she wonders, ""What would it be like to feel true love?"" ""What is this mysterious thing, this pulse of the universe?"" She realizes that it\'s a double-edged sword, that love is both torture and delight, (Italian) ""croce e delizia."" That\'s the intention I want to communicate to you, musically, because, of course, the idea is much more complicated than we can say. In order to do that, I\'ll first sing a repeat of what the tenor\'s saying earlier in the act. Clever Verdi! We like things better the second time around; repetition. Then I will set up the expectation, I\'ll tell you straight off, there will be a high note - Setting that up? - but I will delay that high note as long as possible to increase your motivation to get dopamine into your caudates, so that by the time we relax that tension, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens. (Laughter) (Piano music starts) (Singing) (Singing and piano music end) (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We repeat and/or believe what people tell us to believe - about others and about ourselves. So why not tell stories that are empowering and aspirational and challenge us to be better? (Applause) That is exactly what superhero stories do. The history of comics is about the misfit, the unlikely hero, the ability to create greatness where there was once doubt. The unassuming Peter Parker, the wallflower who\'s picked on and misunderstood, gets bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him extraordinary powers and extraordinary responsibilities. Yet his path is filled with villains who would doubt his determination, who would threaten those he loves, threaten his life choices. And yet Spider-Man, being the hero that he is, would always swing back, he\'d always beat the bad guy and he\'d always get the girl. Or girls, in Spider-Man\'s case. Lots of love drama there. For 75 years, Marvel has been telling the tale of the outcast behind the mask. It\'s through his flaws and desires that we connect with the heart of the character so that when he emerges as a hero, we have a real reason to champion him because we understand those struggles too, don\'t we? And we also want to move past them. Heroes make a choice to fight injustice, to protect the innocent, to put the balance back on the side of the good, no matter how much they sacrifice of themselves. They\'re willing to die for it because they\'ve chosen who they are. And they will defend it no matter what. So when that little girl sat rapt to attention, all those years ago at her television screen, watching the X-Men, it wasn\'t just because they had taken her on an astonishing adventure. It\'s because they told her that it was okay to be different. In fact, you had to fight for it. Because we all want to be heroes, don\'t we? And wouldn\'t it be amazing if heroes looked just like us? So why does a character like Kamala Khan resonate with so many people? Like the first African-American and Latino Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Kamala Khan is so much larger than just a pop-culture icon. She came together in response to that global subconscious desire for representation for those Muslim American, bacon-sniffing, short, nerdy girls like me and for anyone else, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, religion, who just feel like misfits themselves. In the actual Ms. Marvel series, Kamala Khan is just a girl trying to fit in. She\'s constantly negotiating, renegotiating who she is and all of the rules that come with it. Where does she belong? She has no idea. She\'s still figuring out that journey to her authentic self. But all she knows is that she does not want to be limited by the labels imposed upon her. So really, Kamala Khan\'s story is everyone\'s. It\'s about confronting the labels you\'ve been assigned and sculpting them and redefining them until you figure out who you truly are and what you actually believe. One of my favorite mottos - actually I have it written on a post-it over my computer. I look at it every single day, and it was said by a poet named Rumi. And it goes, ""Do not be satisfied with stories, that which has come before. Unfold your own myth."" And that is our challenge. Every single one of us, no matter the categories we\'ve inherited, we must unfold our own myth. And it won\'t be easy. We\'re constantly navigating, rearranging, reinventing others\' expectations of ourselves every day. But every word we write in the narrative of our own lives, we come closer to uncovering what\'s beneath our own masks, maybe even embracing that true misfit, that true crazy one within. Oh, it\'ll be a fight, that\'s for sure. But that battle for your soul, for your authentic self, it\'s worth it, isn\'t it? It\'s bold; it\'s brave. In fact, I would say it\'s heroic. So now it\'s your turn. Tell me your story. Thank you.

""What happened to her?"" ""Why is she in a wheelchair?"" I think, subconsciously, people are hoping that I will talk about it. That I say what it is, tell them about it, open up about it. But the truth is, I\'ve already had enough of it. I\'ve had enough of everyone asking me. I\'ve had enough of explaining it to everyone. So what I\'ve decided to do lately is to start making things up. Every time someone has asked what happened, I make up a completely different story. Like I was attacked by a shark, I jumped off a cliff and survived. Or one time, a little boy asked me what had happened, and, very dramatically, I look at him and say to him, ""I\'m just doing a social experiment to see how people react when confronted with a wheelchair."" Very surprised, he looks at me and says, ""No way. Really? Let me see. Stand up."" The experiment was completely ruined. (Laughter) I believe the problem is not that people are interested in knowing why I am in a wheelchair, that\'s just simply curiosity. I believe the problem is that they ask me about it before asking my name. For me, starting to use a wheelchair was like discovering a new world. A world that, in reality, was always there. Everyone sees it, but not everyone is familiar with it. For me, it was like a change of outlook, a change of routine. Just like any other big change that can occur in your life, whether it\'s, I don\'t know, having a kid, moving to another house, losing a loved one, or changing jobs, it\'s adapting to a new routine. I didn\'t stop doing things; I learned to do things differently. I believe - For me, it was like a change in perspective, really. I went from seeing the world from 5\' 7"" to seeing it from the average height of an 8-year-old kid. The whole world started to be at a different height too. Mirrors, most of all. In 99% of mirrors, the only thing I can see is my forehead. And I come up to here. (Laughter) I discovered that there are things that are made for people like me. When I started to use a wheelchair, I stopped using the women\'s bathroom. I started going to a third bathroom, that bathroom that\'s made for people like me. I stopped entering places where everyone else went in, because most times the main entrances are not accessible. And the entrances for people like me are around the corner, the side door, through the utility room or the garage. I discovered the power of a ramp. For me, accessibility literally means opportunity. Whether or not there is a ramp up on the other side of the street, for me, means whether I can or can\'t cross over. But we live in a world where sometimes not many such opportunities exist. I had to change schools once I started using a wheelchair: the school I\'d been attending my whole life had not been adapted in a way that would allow me to keep going to it. Also, one of the things I found the most difficult were the looks. When you\'re in a wheelchair and you go down the street, everyone is going to look at you. It\'s inevitable. You can\'t avoid someone noticing you went out today without combing your hair. You can\'t avoid not greeting someone that you don\'t feel like greeting. Everyone is going to look at you, or, on the other hand, avoid looking at you. But one of the things that still surprises me the most is that, sometimes, it\'s as if I feel the world is trying to save me. It\'s as if, subconsciously, I go down the street, and people give me saint cards. They invite me to pray to the saints. They recommend doctors. Or they feel the need to give me a message of support. Like, ""Everything\'s going to be fine,"" (Laughter) ""you can do it, if you really want to,"" (Laughter) or they congratulate my friends for being my friends. (Laughter) I don\'t get it. (Applause) I believe - Often I don\'t know how to react to these things because I know people indubitably do it with the best of intentions, But it makes me wonder what a wheelchair is associated with. What the big picture is. Yes, I am in a wheelchair, but ... I\'m fine. I\'m not worried about my life. I don\'t want anyone to come and save me. To me, one of the greatest ironies is that it doesn\'t matter where I am, what I\'m doing, whom I\'m with, whether I\'m in a nightclub dancing the cumbia, people look at me ... and think, ""Wow, what genius!"" (Laughter) ""Wow, what an inspiration!"" (Laughter) ""What an example!"" (Laughter) I could be a serial killer who kills people at night, but, to the world, I\'m an example. (Applause) And that makes me wonder: ""Why do people train, study, take such great pains to be someone in life?"" Better to buy a wheelchair; you become exemplary automatically. (Applause) Sometimes disability is like a taboo. Words are used to name that which is not named. When I sat myself in a wheelchair, automatically, to the world, I became a special person. I became an angel. I became a being of light. (Laughter) And I also came to have different capabilities. I\'ve never really understood these different capabilities, because, I don\'t want to disappoint them, but I can\'t fly. (Laughter) I don\'t have superpowers. I believe the only way I\'m differently abled to all of you is that I have a horn. (Horn) (Applause) I don\'t think any of you have a horn. A disability does not make you better or worse than anyone else. For me, getting used to a wheelchair was a process. A long process. But I always think that it would have been easier if I had met with an environment that had already been adapted, and for it not to have been me who had to adapt to the environment. Everything would have been easier if disability wasn\'t a taboo or a bad word. If people didn\'t think being in a wheelchair meant something was wrong. If being able to get a job, using a public convenience, or getting on a bus, did not have to be a privilege. Everything would be easier if people with disabilities could indeed be examples, could indeed be inspirations, but for their ideas, for their talents, for their passions; not for the mere fact that crossing the street is a challenge. I want to live in a world in which I can come here, I can talk to you for an hour about whatever, about whichever, and be able to leave here without any of you still wondering why, with everything that she said, she at no point told us why she is in a wheelchair. Thank you.

What if sharks -- creatures we see as a threat to life -- could help fix it? Microbiologist Ethan Mann explains how the unusual qualities of shark skin could lead to a new generation of medical devices that reduce bacterial infection.,,,52446,2019-07-30T17:26:29+00:00,"['medical research', 'microbiology', 'technology', 'health', 'fish']","['English', 'Français', 'Galego', 'Italiano', 'Português brasileiro', 'Русский', '中文 (繁體)']",Ethan Mann,Microbiology Maverick,"{'0:00': 'The US Navy has always had this frustrating problem with their fleet. It\'s something called ""fouling."" Now, for all you non-seafaring folk, fouling is when things like algae and barnacles and other marine materials get stuck to the sides of ships and submarines. Used to be able to prevent this fouling by coating ships and submarines with toxic agents, like heavy metals, but these heavy metals aren\'t as effective at keeping ships clean as they used to be. And we want clean ships because fouling on these vessels actually makes them less efficient in the water and can be easier for enemies to detect. This is not good. So several years ago, the US Office of Naval Research called on one of my colleagues, engineer scientist Dr. Anthony Brennan, to devise a solution to prevent fouling without the use of these heavy metals. See, Dr. Brennan was already investigating how things like surface roughness can prevent the attachment of organisms like algae. But Dr. Brennan was struggling. All of the engineered surfaces he came up with algae eventually overcame. And then Brennan found himself at a conference in Hawaii, of all places, and noticed something rather intriguing. Take a look at these three animals: a manatee, a whale and a shark. What do you notice? Well, right. So the whale and the manatee are filthy, but the shark is squeaky clean. This is a property unique to all sharks. The next time you watch Shark Week, you\'ll notice each and every shark you see is pristine. (Laughter) Why? Brennan wanted to find out. So with the help of some brave graduate students, they set out to find a shark. (Laughter) They found one in the shallow water and carefully took a mold of its skin using a dental impression material. Don\'t worry. The shark wasn\'t harmed in the process, although I\'m sure he didn\'t appreciate it. (Laughter) So the students took the mold back to the lab and put it under a microscope, and this is what it looks like. The sharkskin is comprised of little denticles, and they overlap to create a diamond-shape repeating pattern on the sharkskin. Upon further investigation, Brennan and his team noticed that the texture on these denticles is actually what\'s responsible for keeping sharks clean. I\'m a microbiologist and infectious disease expert, and I find this fascinating. I\'ve spent my career trying to keep surfaces clean, especially the surfaces of medical devices. In hospitals this is a massive problem. See, what happens is bacteria who are really normally good find themselves in places they shouldn\'t be as a result of some medical procedure. Sometime during or after surgery, bacteria latch onto the surface of a medical device, stay there, and cause a serious infection; and this makes it impossible for the body to heal. Take a look at these surgical wires used to close a patient\'s sternum following open-heart surgery. Notice the tiny clusters of bacteria on the surface? This patient didn\'t heal for months until the wires were removed, and replaced with clean ones. You know, it used to be we just used antibiotics to treat these types of infections. Antibiotics were an amazing drug, for a while. But eventually, bacteria were exposed to antibiotics so frequently they were forced to adapt. And survival is the key driver of evolution, and that\'s what we\'re talking about here: bacterial evolution. Perhaps you\'ve heard about this in the news. It\'s referred to as ""Antimicrobial Resistance."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call antimicrobial resistance one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. Illnesses that were once easily treatable are now untreatable. In the US alone every year, more than two million people will get an antibiotic resistant infection, and over 23,000 people will die as a result of that infection. The pharmaceutical industry is rushing to develop more and more and more antimicrobials, desperately trying to outpace antimicrobial resistance. But bacteria and germs, they evolve so much more quickly than we could innovate ways to kill them. It\'s clear the antimicrobial era is coming to an end, so we have to think about this in a whole new way. What if instead of trying to kill bacteria after they cause infections, we simply make it harder for bacteria to stick to the surfaces of medical devices in the first place? In other words, we prevent these infections from occurring altogether. That\'s what brings me back to what we\'ve learned from sharks. It\'s the texture of sharkskin that makes them resistant to fouling. So what if we change the texture of medical devices to make them resistant to bacteria causing so many problems? Dr. Brennan knew he had a major medical breakthrough on his hands. He called up some trusted friends right here in Denver Colorado, and they started a company, and they called it Sharklet Technologies. In 2013, I joined the team, and together we used engineered surfaces mimicking the skin of sharks to prevent bacteria and other medical complications. Our first commercial device is a urological catheter, which doctors began using for patients just last year. (Applause) Take a look at these example images. The surface on the left is a smooth surface, and the one on the right is a sharkskin-like texture. Notice how much bacteria\'s on the smooth surface compared to the sharkskin-like surface? This is because the sharkskin-like texture creates an inhospitable surface for bacterial attachment and growth. It works on sharks, and it works here too because the texture takes advantage of principles of surface energy. Now, surface energy is really a description of a detailed property of a surface. It can include things like water interaction or material stiffness. The roughened sharkskin-like texture creates a surface with greater surface energy. You know, we interact with surface energy changes all the time. We often just don\'t notice it. For example, we like when rain beads up and runs off our car, right? Well, this happens best with a nice coat of wax. Wax is a material with greater surface energy characteristics. Now, we can\'t coat medical devices in wax, but we can change their surface texture. And this approach works on all types of medical devices, from catheters to pacemakers, and it\'s effective against all types of bacteria and germs. As it turns out, we can actually do more than just bacteria-proof medical devices. We can prevent other medical complications through understanding the power of surface energy, things like frequent clogging, excessive blood clotting or poor healing interactions. The next generation of medical device surfaces inspired by the skin of sharks will actually expand how medical devices are made. Really the core issue is that we create all types of sophisticated medical devices, things to pump fluid into our blood, keep our heart beating on pace, or even stimulate brain activity. But bad things happen when these devices don\'t interact well with our bodies\' natural mechanisms. We\'ve actually discovered that we can improve how medical devices are tolerated through subtly tuning the surface energy characteristics, like for example, we can prevent a lot of the excessive clotting that\'s occurring here on the smooth surface, compared to the sharkskin-like texture. This means that we can actually match the required surface energy with the medical use to prevent complications, all with the power of sharks. Ultimately, as we continue to engineer smart surfaces, we\'ll require fewer antimicrobials, fewer chemicals and fewer harsh additives, and this will make life-saving medical technology safer for all of us to use. This is innovation in its purest form, to be sure. But it\'s also a good reminder of just how important it is to observe the subtle cues in the raw mystery of the world around us. Thank you.

It was a few weeks before my twelfth birthday, and my father had just died. My mother, who had no professional training, found it very hard to spend the fees for our school fees. And my three brothers and me, she took the help of friends and scholarships in order to educate us. She didn\'t make a difference between my brothers and me. All she wanted was that all of us should excel. When I was 20, I had a semi-arranged marriage, and my husband was posted, in 1954, to England, and I went with him. And I took advantage of being there for three years and studied law. When I returned to India, I was required to train with a senior before I could practice law. So I decided I should get the best lawyer, join the best lawyer, and I zeroed down on someone called Sachin Chaudhary. But it was extremely difficult to get an appointment with him. After great difficulty, I did, and I was full of trepidation when I went to meet him. But I put on a brave front, just as I am doing now. (Laughter) (Applause) He had some idea why I had come, but he wanted to be completely clear. So I told him that I wanted to practice law and I wanted to join his chambers. He was not in favor of women joining the law, so he tried to dissuade me. He said, ""Young woman, instead of joining the legal profession, go and get married."" (Laughter) So I said to him, ""Sir, I am already married."" (Laughter) ""Then go and have a child,"" he advised. ""I already have a child."" (Laughter) ""It\'s not fair to the child to be alone, so you should have a second child."" (Laughter) I said, ""Mr. Chaudhary, I have two children."" (Laughter) So, taken aback for the third time, he said, ""Come and join my chambers. You\'re a persistent young woman, and you will do well at the bar."" After about 20 years of practice, I was appointed a judge at the Delhi High Court, and in 1991, I was the first woman to be chief justice of a state high court. (Applause) As I mentioned earlier, I was 20 when I got married, and my fiancee and his family never demanded a dowry or anything else. We had a simple celebration. We served vanilla ice cream and salted cashew nuts. But we still had fun, and we enjoyed ourselves. So, you can see, that you don\'t need anything extra. But I, now, I\'m happily married for the last 64 years. (Applause) Every woman, every mother, wants her daughter to be married. And when she meets a young man, she tries to size him up to find out if he\'s a suitable boy. But at the back of her mind is worry. Does he want a dowry? If so, how much? In fact, it\'s the curse of dowry that makes parents not want to have girls. In the old days, when girls and boys didn\'t have equal inheritance, a young girl was given stridhan, which is bride\'s wealth, at the time of her marriage. It was something that was passed from a mother to her daughter and consisted of jewelry. It was her personal property. But even that was often taken away by the bride-groom\'s parents and given to the groom\'s sister when she was getting married. So the bride had nothing. Slowly, the prevalence of dowries started. This meant gifts were given not only to the bride but to the bride-groom and to his family. And demands, dowry demands, were negotiated at the time of an arranged marriage. Parents were worried as to how they would meet these demands, which sometimes increased from day to day and from hour to hour as the wedding date approached. Sometimes, just as the wedding ceremony was about to take place, a fresh demand would be made. It was a great trauma for parents, especially those who had more than one daughter. They were bankrupt, spent more than they had, and the extortion sometimes continued even after the wedding. So instead of loving their daughters and wanting to have them, they considered them a curse. And they resorted to something like female feticide or female infanticide. In order to prevent this evil of dowry, an act was passed. It was called the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Before the act, dowries were displayed openly. After the act, the displays stopped. But the giving and taking of dowry continued, and the demand for ostentatious functions and feasts by the bride-groom\'s family, to be paid for by the bride\'s family, continued. This was really terrible. And very few parents would reject a young man if he or his family demanded a dowry. Most would not, even though they knew it was illegal to give or take a dowry. Let me give you an example. The year was 1991. A very senior Supreme Court of India judge had arranged his daughter\'s wedding. I asked him, ""Are you going to give a dowry?"" Remember, this was 30 years after the passing of the Dowry Prohibition Act. He was quiet. And then he said, ""I\'ll tell you the honest truth. I will indeed give a dowry for my daughter because I cannot sacrifice her happiness and her life. In my community, she cannot get married without a dowry. But I promise you, I will not take a dowry for my son."" This is not what I wanted to hear, but at least it was half a step forward. So what do you think? Can the passing of laws change attitudes? In India, with a very patriarchal society, changing attitudes and changing mindsets is extremely difficult, and it\'s a slow process, but we need to fast-forward it. I had hoped that with the succession laws being changed and daughters getting some inheritance rights, the law would have had some effect on the evil of dowry. In 1956, the Hindu Succession Act was passed, and in that year, it was provided in the act that daughters and sons would get equally from their father\'s property which was self-acquired. This, of course, should have made a difference. But it didn\'t seem to have done that. In fact, women were not willing to assert. Let me tell you of an incident. I was a judge at the Delhi High Court. Three young men came for me and wanted - their father had died, he hadn\'t left a will, and they wanted their property to be divided into three parts. I found they had three sisters. So I said to them, ""I will divide it into six parts because that\'s what the law says, and each sibling should get one share."" They protested. They said, ""Our sisters are married, our sisters have got dowries, and they have given us relinquishment deeds."" I was not happy, so I insisted they bring the sisters to court because I was not sure whether the sisters had been coerced into giving their relinquishment deeds or they didn\'t know the law. When the women came, I asked them, ""Do you know the law?"" And they said, ""Yes."" ""So then why are you giving up your share?"" And this is what they said: ""We do not want to have any problems with our brothers or spoil our relationships with our brothers because if in the future we need anything of any sort, to whom shall we turn except our brothers, our natal family?"" So they knew what was happening. And I said to the young men, ""If you were six brothers, you would have happily shared and got one-sixth each, so why are you depriving your sisters?"" But they were adamant, and their sisters also were not willing to withdraw their relinquishment deeds. So, though they were aware, they were not willing to assert. Many people are not aware that since 2005 - that\'s almost 10 years ago - the daughters\' rights of inheritance have been widened and now include not only the self-acquired property of the father but also the ancestral property - unless, of course, the father wills away the property to someone else. So fathers, we tell you, do not will the property away to your sons or daughters. Make sure your daughters get their legitimate share. (Applause) You know, it reminds me of the story of Sudha Goel because daughters need to have control of their property, they need to feel secure, and Sudha Goel had been given a dowry. One December night, the neighbors heard her screaming: ""Bachao! Bachao! Save me! Save me!"" So they rushed and forced their way into the flat and found her in flames. Her mother-in-law and her husband were simply sitting there. She said, ""These people have killed me. They have taken my gold and everything."" There are hundreds of such cases in India every year. How do we do it? How do we take steps to stop this? I think that I can summarize it in four words. First, awareness. Second, assertion. Third, attitude change. And fourth, action. So, sisters, don\'t be blackmailed by - emotionally blackmailed by your brothers. Don\'t take dowries; don\'t take after dowries. Demand your inheritance. Brothers, husbands, and fathers, make sure that your daughter gets her legitimate share. And make sure that she has that confidence that is important for her. Do the legal thing, not the illegal. So when you look forward, make sure your daughters get what they deserve. You should not let your daughters down, and they will not let you down. (Applause) So this is the mantra: Inheritance, not dowry. Inheritance, not dowry. Repeat it, act upon it, and get others to act upon it as well. I\'d like to end with an appeal by a daughter to her parents. ""Father, why do you discriminate against me when I can be as good as my brother? Mother, nurture, nourish, and educate me, and you will see that I will not be a burden but will control my own destiny. And you will have nothing to fear when Brother is not there. I will look after both of you in your old age. I ask only to be treated equally. Will you not dare? So that I have the freedom to choose and the right to care and am no longer the prisoner of my own gender, unable to resist or retaliate against injustice. Oh Father, give me a chance. Just give me a chance. Oh Mother, break the bonds of tradition and let me into the sunlight to dance, to dance, to dance.""

I get to live in two universes. When I go to bed, I don\'t know to which world my dreams will take me. And when I\'m underwater, I\'m weightless, I can move in three dimensions. I can spend all day staring into the blue or marveling at the extraordinary, beautiful, mysterious, sometimes fearsome creatures that live in the sea. To be a human underwater is a completely different sensory experience. But it also strikes fear into me, not me as a human, but me as the fish that I spend my life trying to understand. Because the ocean can be a place full of danger and full of seemingly impossible challenges. Let me give you the example of the perilous life cycle of a coral reef fish. So we\'re all familiar with the brightly colored beautiful fish that live on coral reefs - cities of life full of color. But each year, these fish produce eggs, and the eggs hatch into tiny, almost microscopic larvae, and they spend several weeks at sea developing, only the size of a grain of rice. And after about two or three weeks, they\'re competent, ready to return to a coral reef where hopefully, once they found the right reef, they can gradually mature and join their adult community. Now, this seems paradoxical: you live in the perfect environment, and yet you send your offspring out to sea. Why would that be so? I\'ve spent my life trying to understand some of the processes that make this life cycle possible. In particular, how to fish find a reef? You\'re out at sea, at the mercy of ocean currents. How on earth, if you\'re the size of a grain of rice, do you find home? How do you choose the right place to live? How do you find a hiding place? These are the challenges that I try to tackle with some of the research that I do. Now, how would you do it? If you were this tiny fish at sea, what what information would you want to try and make that life cycle possible? Well, we know that some fish are able to smell different components of their environment. Some fish are able to look at the position of the sun in the sky, even the way sunlight shines through the clouds, perhaps even use celestial nighttime visual cues. Some fish even have a magnetic sense. So is that enough information to get these fish home? Well certainly, one thing that they probably can\'t use is sound, right? 60 years ago, Jacques Cousteau brought into the living rooms of the world, for the first time, the wonder of our underwater world. He invented scuba, to be able to take cameras underwater and beam those images back to people around the world. It was a remarkable film in so many ways, except perhaps for the title. You see, Jacques Cousteau told us that the ocean was a silent world. But when we go into the ocean, we know that\'s not true. Without scuba, we hear whales singing. This is the love song of a humpback whale. And whales can communicate over tens of miles, sometimes hundreds of miles, as they interact with each other. When we look on a coral reef, we realize it\'s not just whales and dolphins making sound; the fish can speak too. Fish produce popping, grunting, whooping, trumpeting sounds, and they do this to warn each other of predators, to be able to call each other over when they find food, and sometimes, particularly around the breeding season, to try and really impress each other. And so they have some amazing songs within the world of fish. Here\'s some of the croaking sounds of sergeant majors, the whooping sound of an ambo-damselfish and the deep grunting love song, in this case of a cod. So fish use sound; it\'s essential to their lives. And it\'s not even just the fish. When we start looking at the invertebrates that live on the reef too, we realize that lobsters can play their antennae like a fiddler would play the violin, and snapping shrimp, that probably are no bigger than the size of your thumb, with a claw no bigger than the size of your thumbnail, are able to produce one of the loudest underwater explosions every time they open their claw and push a bubble forwards into the water which implodes with a flash of light and an enormous bang. And all together, that creates a crackling sound that gives coral reefs its soundscape. So 18 years ago, I asked a question which, at the time, almost everybody I was working with on the Great Barrier Reef thought was crazy: is it possible that fish could use sound as a way of finding their way home? Now, to ask that question, my first approach was to take light traps - light traps are bright boxes with clear glass windows which have slits in them, like letter boxes - and when you shine a bright light underwater on the edge of the reef, you can intercept the larval fish, the baby fish, as they come back to the reef. Many fish, like moths, are attracted to light, and we can catch them in our traps and we can count them as they return. But just to mix it up a little bit, I then hung underneath a trap a speaker. These are underwater speakers sold for synchronized-swimming teams to be able to keep beat underwater, but we use these speakers to playback recordings of coral reefs, to ask the question, ""Are fish, at this tiny early stage in their life, several weeks old, attracted to coral reef sound?"" And sure enough, three months later, putting these traps out night after night, we found that we caught more than twice as many fish in our noisy traps compared to the quiet ones. And then, to test whether this really was enough for a fish to choose where it wanted to make its home, we hung the speakers over small piles of dead coral rubble, artificial reefs that we built on the sand flats. And sure enough, the fish came swimming in when we were playing our sound. So sound is clearly a cue that these fish were using to hear their way home. So I\'ve spent the last 15 years listening to the ocean, trying to interpret what these fish can hear. What is it, what information is available that gives fish this sensory experience that encourages them home? Now, as a marine biologist, one of the privileges is getting to play with some very big, very expensive toys. And I\'m just going to share two of mine with you today. The first is the good ship Masifa, which we invented as a way of being able to sail a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, over the reefs so that we could start to understand the rich tapestry of sound that\'s made as you travel from different types of reef. And then the second one is my hydrosaur. This is a - you could see at the time that funding for marine bio acoustics was in its early stages. This is an inflatable dinosaur, but I was able to strap my microphone to this and leave it out overnight, and by doing that, we started to realize there were patterns in the soundscape. At dusk, all of the nocturnal fish, the predators, emerge from their caves, and they start calling to each other as they go looking for food. So we get a dusk chorus. And then at dawn, these fish disappear back into the reef but out come all the daytime fish, and they\'ve got to reestablish their territories, much like birds would do in a forest, and so we get a dawn chorus too. The reef is alive with noise, and that noise has patterns. And we\'ve explored this by combining recordings with underwater surveys. And with our underwater surveys, we realize that we can hear whether there are coral there. We can hear which species live there. We realize that the fish at sea are doing much what we would do if we were moving to a new city: we\'d perhaps get on the internet and do some research into different suburbs that we might want to live in. We think fish can do the same thing by listening to their environment and choosing where they want to live. We now know that reefs all sound different; they have signature sounds. Baby fish can select the best habitat for their kind by using sound. And amazingly, it turns out so can many other animals on coral reefs: crabs, lobsters, clams, oysters, even corals themselves. Here\'s a few places that we\'ve worked. This is Balicasag, which is a marine protected area in the Philippines. You can see it\'s full of life. It\'s highly protected, there\'s no fishing, and as a result, when we listen to it, it\'s a wonderful soundscape. You can hear the fish communicating, you can hear the snapping shrimp. Now sadly, if we go three bays around the corner to Bilang-Bilangan, we find a more typical Filipino reef. This is a reef that\'s been heavily overfished, so there are no herbivores to graze away at the algae, which now smothers the reef. You can even see craters from dynamite fishing, and when we listen to it ... you can just about hear it. So a tiny fish would have to pretty much swim into this reef before it found it. The next generation are not coming home. We are changing the soundtrack of the ocean through overfishing and poor environmental protection. Let\'s go somewhere better: to the Great Barrier Reef. This is, for marine biologists, the benchmark. This is where we go to see what coral reefs once were like, what coral reefs can be like with really effective management, highly protected marine reserves, long distances away from cities, from pollution, and as a result, beautiful bustling underwater cities full of life. You can hear the Great Barrier Reef; it\'s a wonderful thing. And we\'ve studied this for 15 years to make reference to the reefs around the world. At least, we have until three years ago, when tragedy struck. With painful predictability, we saw the water temperature starting to rise. Oceanographic conditions meant the water was staying in one location, and for three weeks, the Great Barrier Reef cooked. We saw the reef in front of our eyes dying. And when we go back to the Great Barrier Reef now, we see in the northern part, where we do our research, 80% of it is dead. When we listen to that reef, it\'s 75% quieter. The snapping shrimp have gone. The complexity, the diversity of the sound is missing; it\'s become an acoustic desert. And so we realize, with climate change, we are changing the soundtrack of the ocean. These, in some ways, are gradual changes - overfishing, poor management, climate change - but we also realize when we take our recordings on a day-to-day basis, we change the soundtrack of the ocean by driving motor boats around. Millions of motor boats every day drive around coral reef environments, with engines that rattle, with propellers that cavitate, creating bubbles which screech in the water as they burst. And we\'ve realized that their sound causes stress to all of the animals that experience it. And with stress comes poor decisions: the fish are no longer able to respond to predators, to be able to find food, to be able to court, to be able to successfully reproduce. This motorboat noise is a form of noise pollution that makes us realize we are changing the soundtrack of the ocean. Now, if this was the end of the talk, it would be a sorry tale, but as a scientist, I asked myself, ""What is my role? Why am I trying to do the science that I\'m doing? Is my duty simply to monitor, to measure, to assess how the world is changing and to report that? Or can we take that knowledge, and can we actually turn it into practical solutions?"" So here\'s the spiny chromis, wonderful fish, lives on the Great Barrier Reef in monogamous pairs, a male and female living together. They lay their eggs in the reef, and their eggs hatch, and unusually, they bring their young through those first few weeks on the reef, they protect them, and you can see their baby fish out here, the larvae of the spiny chromis. Now, if we monitor how well they do near to boating channels, we realize that that motorboat noise means the adults don\'t feed as well, they don\'t defend the larvae against predators in the same way, and the larvae fail to develop, less larvae make it through. So, is that a real tragic story of how with noise pollution we\'re affecting reproduction? Or could it be that actually, if we turn it on its head, we realize our comparison is what happens if the boats aren\'t there: we see more reproduction, we see better behavior in the adults, more feeding, more defense against predators. Could we be talking here about a story of acoustic protection? If we go to the Great Barrier Reef and we play those sad recordings of the current state of the Great Barrier Reef, the fish no longer arrive in the numbers that we would hope for. If we play the recordings of the Great Barrier Reef as it used to be, the fish still come. So here, are we talking about a story of the loss of a sensory cue that\'s essential to close the loop of the life cycle? Or could this be a story about the potential value of acoustic enrichment? This is something that my group now are actively pursuing around the world, and we\'re hugely excited that there are tools with acoustics that we\'re realizing might be part of the solution. So we realize it\'s our gift to change the soundtrack of the ocean in this generation, but to change it for the better, not the worse. With technology, we can improve the sound outputs of boat engines - modern engines are far quieter. With environmental protection, we can keep boats away from breeding grounds, from nursery grounds. We can give quiet nights to allow the fish to come in and settle. And with acoustic enrichment, we can potentially accelerate the recovery of habitats that have been worst hit. Thank you for listening.

I\'m from India. The home of ancient mathematics. But me, I just hated math. (Laughter) Until it saved my life. I grew up in Akola, a small town 700 miles away from the capital city. In my community, we never had a culture of girls attending school beyond the age of 10 or 12 years. In fact, some women would tell me, ""Why do you need education? Just learn the household work so that you can take care of your family."" But I never wanted to abide myself by the ""normal"" rules for girls. And I would think to myself, instead of just learning the household work, why not learn how to make money so that I can actually take care of my family? (Laughter) I knew if I had to do something different, I would have to stay in school. But that was hard. As it was socially not accepted, everybody was against it. But I was a stubborn young girl. I did everything I could to continue studying, even if that meant stitching school uniforms or making festival greeting cards. I did all that. Well, I had excellent grades in all subjects. All except one. You guessed it: math. All these calculations, formulas, multiplication; I just couldn\'t get them right. After I finished college, I realized I had no future in Akola, so I decided to do something almost nobody in my town had ever done before: to leave my home town, by myself, a single woman. Nobody wanted me to do that. I remember when I walked up to my mom and told her, ""Mama, I\'m leaving."" She looked at me and said, ""Uma, I know how difficult it is for you and even for me, and I cannot even support you openly, but I want you to have this."" And she hands me a gold bangle. That was the only jewelry left with her. She said, ""I don\'t have much but this is for you to buy the bus ticket."" You can see the bus ticket here. It\'s been ten years. I still have this. As a promise that I won\'t let my mom sacrifice anything more for me. So, on 22nd of July, 2007, I arrived in Pune, a city of four million people. I had never been out of my village before  so being in the city for the first time, I was mesmerized and excited. And scared as well. I didn\'t even know if I could trust the taxi driver while taking the taxi for the first time in an unknown city. Life in the city was extremely hard at first. I was away from my family, didn\'t have any friends. I had brought very little money with me; around three and a half dollars. So I used to eat every second day - every other day - so that I can save as much as I can. Yes, good things take time, but they do happen. And finally, it happened to me. I was given an opportunity to work in a primary school, as a teacher. Wow, I was so happy. Until I got to know the subject they gave me to teach. (Laughter) Yes, it was math. (Laughter) And I\'m like, ""Oh God, how will I teach something I hate so much?"" (Laughter) But I had no choice so I started teaching math. You know, the basics like multiplication tables. I remember I struggled every night to figure out lessons for my students. I was hating it. And I was afraid if I didn\'t do well, I might not make it. But the more I worked on it, trying to make it interesting, trying to make it fun, the more I realized the pattern in these numbers. As if these multiplication tables were sending me a message, I sensed as if these numbers were talking to me. And that\'s when I figured out the magic these odd and even numbers have; the poetry, the symmetry they have. Let me show you what I mean: Let\'s look at table of three for example. Feels like we are back in school? (Laughter) Three, we all know it\'s an odd number. And if I multiply three with another odd number, it gives me a result which is definitely an odd number. Like this one here: Three times three gives us nine.  An odd number. And then I noticed something very interesting about it. If I multiply an odd number with an even number, it ultimately becomes an even number, like this one here. Three times four gives us 12. An even number. So, odd multiplied with odd, the result has to definitely be an odd number. But odd multiplied with something even, no matter how many times you do it, it will definitely give us an even number. And I\'m like, this is quite me. With all the odds I was up against, if I multiply my odd situation, with my odd behavior ... (Laughter) (Applause) So what happens? I get myself into another odd situation. (Laughter) But the magic is, if I multiply my odd situations with my even behavior, with my positive behavior, it gets me to better results, to even results. And if one doesn\'t stop when the situations are odd like this, if one keeps pushing himself, keeps multiplying his blessings, keeps multiplying his skills, even though the beginning is, the end will never be odd. Wow, so once I got to know this, I was like, if something odd can teach me such a valuable lesson of life, I\'m sure there is something interesting about the even numbers as well. (Laughter) So, let\'s look at table of two, for example. What I notice here is every time, right from the beginning to the end, all multiplication results are even, without any odds. And how is it possible? That\'s possible because the number itself which is getting multiplied, is an even number. This tells me if I am even to myself, as an individual, nothing odd will come my way. (Laughter) Now this of course doesn\'t mean I don\'t come across any odd or bad situations. I certainly do. But facing them with even attitude makes the whole difference. That\'s how, even though I have to struggle hard for my basic rights, instead of being upset and angry, I am happy and even to myself, because the struggle made me stronger, made me who I am today. Now I have these learnings, these secrets from all different multiplication tables. One of my favorites is table of 11. And I think most of us liked, when we were in school, because that is the easiest one to multiply. What I love about this is the perfect symmetry in it. The one and one, the two and two. Isn\'t that beautiful? And easy, of course. For me, the question was: How can I have my life this similarly easy and beautiful? For me these two symmetrical numbers reflect the outside me and the inside me. I can live in harmony, I can live in peace  only when my outside matches my inner being. Isn\'t this all we\'re looking for? We can be anybody; maybe two, maybe three. Whoever we are, unless or until our inside personality matches our outside personality, our outside personality matches our inside personality, we cannot live in peace, we cannot live in harmony. Now, because math became my art, became my reminder, my guide of what I needed to do, and what my goal was, I started loving math. Because of this, I was not only able to keep my job, but also make it interesting for others. Now ten years down the line, I have a wonderful job in a great company. I am able to move my entire family to Pune to live with me. Now nobody says I shouldn\'t have done this. Rather everyone appreciates for what I stood for. As kids, we all are asked to solve math problems. But in reality, math solved many of my problems. Thank you for having me. Dhanyavaad (Thank you).

The prerequisite for these rules? We need to make robots smarter. Ayanna Howard explains how robots can become smarter (hint: it is related to how smart we humans are).",0:06:13,6.216666667,44437,2020-06-08T17:32:55+00:00,"['technology', 'education', 'robot', 'robots', 'TED-Ed', 'animation', 'design', 'invention']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Magyar', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Русский', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Ayanna Howard,Roboticist,"{'00:20': 'So how many of you have a robot at home? OK, I see about 20, 30 hands. That\'s actually pretty good. How many of you would want your own personal robot at home? I know I would! OK, so why doesn\'t this exist? Why can\'t I go to the convenience store or the department store and, you know, go up to the cashier and say, ""Yeah, I want my personal robot""? Well, I\'m going to talk to you about how to make that happen. The thing that we need to do is to make robots smarter. Now, no one will argue that we don\'t have robots. We have rovers that are going to Mars and are getting science data and expanding our understanding of the world. We have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars that we drive today. We even have robots that are helping our military, that are out disposing of bombs so our soldiers can come home safely. So we have all this, so why don\'t we have the personal robot? Why don\'t I have my robot chef? Because I can\'t cook. (Laughter) So, here\'s one of my robots, this is a simple walking robot, but it is by no means smart. And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition of what a robot is. How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start designing and getting our hands dirty, we have to come up with rules, kind of the laws, rules of conduct. And why is this? Because if these robots are smart, they might be capable of more than we want. And so we have to come up with rules. Thou, robot, shall not harm a human. Thou shall obey me, and only me. Thou shall always protect me at all possible times. So we have to lay the boundaries, the rules of engagement, before we actually start designing. And then we have to come up with tools. So I believe that the way to make robots smarter is to mimic people. Now, our brains are complex, there\'s a lot going on in there, and so, it\'d be hard to try to open up the brain and actually figure out how to mimic humans. The best way is to observe, is to actually watch people do things, and figure out what are they doing, what are their thoughts, what are their actions, what are their emotions? And so, part of making robots smarter is actually trying to mimic humans, mimic how we do things, so maybe they can do it a little bit better. And so, some of the tools are varied. And so, I\'m classically trained as an electrical engineer. I never thought I\'d have to understand things like child psychology, infant development. So, understanding that the way infants develop to children, develop to adults, and how they learn and interact is actually important for robotics. I didn\'t understand that I\'d actually have to watch tapes of monkeys interacting and communicating, because they have a whole social kind of mechanism where they learn from each other, and so that\'s really good to make robots smarter. And, of course, neuroscience, I\'ve always been fascinated with neuroscience, but I never understood that I had to figure out why do the neurons fire, what about the environment helps us to learn, and all of those really contribute to making robots a little bit smarter. And so, some of the things that I do -- and this is just a little snapshot -- one of the things is mirroring. So they say our ability to look in a mirror and wave and actually recognize that the person on the other side is us, that self-awareness, is a sign of intelligence, and that allows us to then look at someone pitch a ball and figure out, ""OK, I know how to pitch a ball, I\'m going to mirror their improvement."" And so I actually have a robot where we are trying to design a robot health coach. And so, I have an exercise physiologist showing the robot how to do some exercises. You know, we want to get strong. And then, the other thing is learning. So, learning is important. We do this as children, we do this even as adults, we do this as elder. And yet, one form of learning is muscle memory. So how many of you play an instrument? OK, so when you start off, for example, if you think about the violin, you start off and your instructor might actually come and move your hand a little bit or maybe move your bow a little bit up. So they actually touch you in order to give you muscle memory. And that helps you understand how to do things a little better. And so we actually have a learning methodology where of course, we\'re not going to take the motors and move the legs, and so we have to Nunchuk to give our robot muscle memory in terms of how to do dance moves. And then, lastly, is creativity. So, you might ask, ""Robots? Creativity? I don\'t get this. Why does the robot have to be creative? What about creativity makes them smarter?"" Well, creativity and imagination, those are the things that allow us to create problems when we don\'t know how to attack it. They allow us to make something out of nothing. I mean, if you look at the apps that at out there and the tablets, and the iPads, and the iPhones, and the Androids -- 20 years ago they didn\'t exist. So, how is it that we got from something where there was nothing and expanded? It was our imagination. It was our creativity. And these are the things that allow us to figure out new things. And so, I have a robot that is creative, it plays piano, is a composer, and if you listen, it plays ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."" (Music) So, all of this together, the last thing is interaction. So, you have a robot, you want it to be your playmate, your teacher, your instructor, you want it to interact. And isn\'t it so cute? (Laughter) So, interaction is key, it is key to understanding how to work in our world with us, and so the interaction piece is very important. It deals with communication, it deals with understanding, it deals with gaze, it deals with attention. All of these things together allow that interaction and our robots to be smart. And so these are just some of the tools that we use in order to make robots smarter. So, I want to leave you with one thought. So, I\'m all for robots and smart robots. I mean, that\'s what I do, I\'d be out of a job if I didn\'t believe in that. But yet, where does it end? How far do we push it? How far and how smart should we make our smart robots? Thank you.

Alongside videos of Bailey providing emotional support to the patients at a Yokohama children's clinic, Morita makes the case for bringing dogs (and their healthcare professional handlers) into hospitals everywhere.",,,43211,2019-04-05T21:43:28+00:00,"['health', 'animals', 'emotions', 'healthcare', 'humanity']","['English', '日本語']",Yuko Morita,,"{'0:00': ""The second bond is: between a facility dog and their hander, who live together twenty-four seven. We always spend holidays together too. This is very important; just getting together while working and saying 'Bye-Bye' after five doesn't make any sense. We sleep at night and Bailey sleeps with his head on my arm. The bond between a facility dog and their handler is the basis on which a facility dog works professionally. Only the bond with me can convince Bailey to trust me to work together. But the truth is; you may think that a training dog will do anything I say, Bailey is a stubborn guy who goes only where he wants. To a direction he doesn't to want to go, he does like this. Can you see he is hanging on with all his might? Planting his feet firmly on the ground, digging his nails into it, he never goes where he doesn't want to. While walking on the street, I sometimes struggle with Bailey sitting there. People passing by always say laughing, 'That's troublesome'. But he has never refused to go to the hospital. On the contrary, he sometimes refuses to go home, squatting there, going back into the hospital ward. Dogs easily understand what people are thinking about them. Because there are many people who love him, Bailey loves the hospital very much. Both a dog and people are mutually affected; that is where the facility dog belongs. This is why non-sentient toy dogs cannot make this happen. A robot dog can not make this happen. The third bond is between Bailey and the medical staff. The handler of a facility dog is a medical staff. The reason why only medical staff can be a handler of a facility dog is: that a facility dog's work includes not only healing mentally, but also curing physically. Bailey and I sometimes take a part in the conversations where treatment courses of patients are decided. I also figure out how our patient kids are and work out how to approach this patient. I also write on the medical charts. In this way, to be involved with specific purpose is what only facility dogs are capable of, and why a handler of a facility dog must be certified medical staff. It has been five years since Bailey and I started working in Japan. We have met thousands of children. We once met a kid in the terminal phase of disease and the kid could not eat. He wanted to but he couldn't eat; that was his situation. Given a short span of time, both his family and nurses wished that he could enjoy whatever little amount of food he could. Then there was a suggestion made Bailey attended at his dinner table. With Bailey, the kid was happy to sit up smiling. Saying, 'Bailey, look at me', though it was only a few mouthful, but he could managed to grab spaghetti into his mouth. He could also enjoy ice cream, not being forced to do so, but willingly to do so. Only the presence of Bailey bedside could make that level of change. The bad impression of a hospital changed so much as to make children say, 'I want to be hospitalised to see Bailey'. With Bailey, kids can double their fun. With Bailey, kids can share tears and fears. Most children are discharged from hospital safe and sound. But sadly, some kids have to leave this world forever, and Bailey sometimes sleeps with them till just before their last moments. We say 'You know, Bailey's with you', 'It's warm, isn't?' to kids. The time goes on sadly but warmly. We sometimes attend a funeral for children. When parents have to close the lid of their own child's coffin, can you imagine how they feel? In fact every family says 'We were really happy to have Bailey with us'. They always say that. 'Before Bailey, the hospital stay had been just so heart-wrenching'. 'With Bailey our kid's life changed so much'. These are what bereaved families said to us. A family who lost their child will reflect on their child everyday, through their long span of life. Remembering their child as 'a poor soul who went through so many painful operations; or remembering their child as 'a laughing kid sleeping with Bailey just before death; their feelings are completely different, aren't they? We wish to make a small portion of happiness in their heartbreaking memory. We wish the bereaved family remember as many smiles of their kid as possible. The Facility Dog Programme is not an option, but necessity for hospital care, that's what I strongly feel about it. Japan's medical care is said to be the highest in the world. Not just curing disease, but also having an environment for healing disease more proactively is necessary, I think. For patients, they can't have too much fun. There are a lot of facility dogs in Europe and the US, but in Japan we have only two. I would like to have facility dogs as a standard in Japanese hospitals and make Japanese hospitals a fun place to be in, even for patients who have medical conditions. So many children who passed away are watching for us from heaven. For those kids, I would like to make the Japanese medical front a place where I can be proud to say, 'Hey, it's a good hospital, isn't it?'

Blending into the background, analyzing and observing a situation, is where I find the most comfort, or, as I\'ll get to later on in this talk, when I\'m on the road by myself. Unless this lady is with me. Yes, I\'m referring to my camera as a lady. (Laughter) She is my safety blanket, and I\'ve spent more time with my camera than with most people in my life. I\'m an artist, I am a photographer, I\'m a self-described nomadic creator. It\'s one of those creative professions that when you tell people, they say, ""Wow, I wish I could do that!"" Or, ""What do you really do for work?"" (Laughter) Or my personal favorite, ""Did you go to school for this?""

Now, I could stand here and I can talk about how I\'ve brushed shoulders with world leaders, and my surreal five minutes that I spent with President Obama. Or I could talk about photographing Hillary Clinton a week before the election, after a rally in North Carolina. Or the tremendous emotional weight for myself photographing Darren Wilson a year after the events in Ferguson, Missouri, for the New Yorker, to then, only a year later, photograph Bryan Stevenson, and he is an advocate and a lawyer based out of Mobile, Alabama, who fights for the under-represented, and we had a conversation about race that still stays with me today. Or just what\'s the easiest and what most people can relate to: celebrity. So, I could talk about Agelina Jolie, or I could talk about the TV icon that\'s Sarah Jessica Parker, or I can just talk about the numerous actors and musicians and notable people that I\'ve interacted with over the last decade. And I love my job and I love my work, but that\'s not what I\'m here to talk to you about. I\'m going to talk about when I\'m in my 2003 Buick, driving cross-country for weeks at a time, and how that\'s when I\'m feeling the most fulfilled. But first, I need to give a little backstory on me and why I do what I do. So, think of it like in an abridged episode of ""This American Life,"" just not that long. (Laughter) So, I am a white, cis, queer man from a working-class family in New York, and with all things being relative, I didn\'t grow up with the utmost privilege, and it wasn\'t uniquely terrible either. My parents, however, were too involved with their own demons for me to ever truly feel seen or heard. And it wasn\'t necessarily their fault. It was merely just a casualty of their reality. Depression, addiction, anger, resentment overwhelmed both of them. When I was seven, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. It was the first of a decade-long battle that she ended up surviving from. It was also the same time that she showed me how to make her a screwdriver. When I was ten, I knew that I was queer, or that I at least liked boys, and by 13, my mother outed me. It was an experience that let me feeling like my identity was stripped from me. By 14, my dad had a DUI or two, I don\'t really remember. By 16, he moved out of the house, and by 18, I didn\'t really speak to either of them. So, my world up until this point made me feel that my experiences and my feelings would never actually compare to that of my parents. And intellectually, I knew better, but I didn\'t actually know what would make me feel differently. All I knew was that I didn\'t want anyone that came into my life to ever feel like they were not seen. And then, I picked up a camera. For me, photography was always really interesting because of the immediacy and collaborative nature of it. It would be a way for me to meet people that were outside of the safe mental bubble that I had created for myself. And so, I started photographing, and as I started interacting with other people, I realized that the interaction itself was actually more interesting to me than the photograph. When I started realizing that, and I thought about my dad, who had recently got sober, I wanted him to feel seen. So, at this point, he and I were still very estranged, and I was in graduate school and my professor, Collier Schorr, said something to me that still echoes in my head pretty much every day: my work was ""too easy,"" and just because I could make something that ""looked good"" did not mean that it was interesting. And so, I needed to challenge myself and my craft. Ironically enough, after years of spending my time making myself feel comfortable, I needed to be uncomfortable again. So, I asked my dad if he would be willing to sit for a portrait. This was the first one that I took of him. Then, I took a break because I needed to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out what it was that I actually wanted to do with him. And so, I continued to photograph him and we started to have a dialogue, but it was through photographs. And I even actually started taking portraits of myself with him because I wanted to, at first, just have a close physical proximity to him. And the idea of this made me realize I needed full immersion, I needed no easy escape plan. And so, I asked him, kind of not even thinking it would happen, if he would go on the road trip that we never took when I was a kid, and surprisingly, he said, ""Yeah, sure, let\'s do it."" And so, he and I hit the road, and as this happened, we started creating this fantasy relationship that never actually existed. (Laughter) But the experience of making these photographs created a bond between the two of us that we were incapable of doing otherwise. It was my a-ha moment for photography. I was using my camera as a therapist. It became this third party that allowed the two of us to communicate with each other even when we weren\'t actually talking. We finally actually saw each other. So, fast-forward about a decade later, and I am no longer working with my dad, but I am photographing strangers spontaneously that I meet on the road. Now, about a month before the election, I was having tremendous anxiety and feeling very stagnant about my work in general. I began seeing friends withdraw and the overall feeling of frustration on social media. And to be quite honest, I just wanted to escape. And so, I hit the road, and I didn\'t have any destinations in mind. I just knew I wanted to drive cross-country and I wanted to escape. And then, about a day into being on the road, I realized I needed to be doing something while I was on the road, because being just with yourself can lead to a lot, a lot of soul-searching. So, once I realized I wanted to be doing something, I thought back to the time with my dad and how pivotal and also very cathartic it was for me, for my craft and also my mental health. And so, I wanted to do that with strangers, and I went on Instagram, I went on Facebook, I downloaded all of the dating and hook-up apps, and I started messaging everyone that I could within every town that I stopped in. Now, when a stranger approaches you online, it leads to a little hesitation. And I say ""stranger"" and I just want to let you know I\'m utilizing a community that is already comfortable for me, and that\'s of gay or queer-identifying men. And so, I would send messages with a brief little description of what I was doing. I wanted to come and meet you, I wanted to come to your home, we could meet in public, and I wanted to take your portrait - I got the majority of [them] being noes, and a lot of variations of, ""That\'s creepy"" or - (Laughter) ""I don\'t really photograph well."" But there was something that did come up pretty often, and it was, ""Why me?"" And it was that other a-ha moment for me. There didn\'t need to be a ""why me."" I wanted everyone that I interacted with to not only feel special, but to also feel like their stories could be heard. So, this body of work, it\'s called ""The Day of The Lone Wolf,"" and it\'s from a book called ""The Secret [Language] of Birthdays,"" and it happens to be the day that I was born on. Now, I casually mentioned my mother earlier, and it was by no accident. Her and I are still estranged, but I wanted to take this moment to thank her. When I was younger, she read to me from The Secret Language of Birthdays, and she used the personality traits that were depicted for The Day of The Lone Wolf, both to criticize and also occasionally appraise me, such as emotionally ""sensitive,"" and ""impulsive,"" and ""contradictory."" Now in my mid 30\'s I\'ve reclaimed my identity as a queer man and I\'ve also reclaimed The Day of The Lone Wolf, and I\'m creating in honor of it. So, since that first road trip, I\'ve gotten cross-country two more times, and the only thing that you actually know about these photographs is the common denominator is me. Now, everyone has a story, you\'ve been listening to mine - And so, while you may not know the particulars of their struggles or of their achievements or even of their privilege, there is one thing that you do know: they allowed themselves to be vulnerable with a stranger, and that\'s what I\'ve done with you today. Thank you.

A story of owning your truth in the face of adversity.",,,40655,2018-10-26T18:16:11+00:00,"['LGBT', 'sports', 'identity', 'culture', 'social change']","['English', 'Português brasileiro']",Shane Wickes,Student,"{'0:00': 'I love football. I started playing when I was 12 years old. It has been a dominant presence in my life ever since. From youth football, to high-school, and college, and now as a coach. Football has played a huge role in shaping me as a person. Recently, I achieved my dream job of becoming varsity line coach at my high-school alma mater. Last March I was at a coaching clinic. It was late in the afternoon and I was tired. These coaching clinics can tend to be a bit of a drag at times. Hours and hours, and days and days of the presentations on the x\'s and o\'s of football. There was one presentation, though, that looked interesting. It was titled ""Disneyland."" This presentation changed my life. This talk was not about the x\'s and o\'s of football. But rather about the emotional truth of why we coaches coach. We are coaches so that we can have a meaningful impact on young people\'s lives, and help them become better people. As coaches, we want to have the kind of impact that assure that one day our players can hold hands with their children and walk into Disneyland. The moral of this incredible message was this: as coaches, we can preach to our players that it is more important for them be better people than it is great football players. But if we are not honest with them and do not practice what we preach, it will never work. In other words, teenagers are adept at sensing bullshit. (Laughter) As coaches, we must be willing to share our truth. And sharing our truth is the only way we can have the kind of impact we truly want to have. The coach who gave this presentation, his truth was that his son became a drug addict due to the bullying and pressure he was subjected to from his dad being the head football coach at his school in Eagle, Idaho, a program that at the time was not very succesful. I went from a presentation on how to run the power against a 3-4 defense to the most honest, emotional and inspirational talks on coaching philosophy I\'d ever heard. So it got me thinking. What\'s my bullshit? What is unique about me that I bring to the table that will have a meaningful impact? What is my truth? My truth is this. I\'m a former college football player. I\'m a current high-school football coach. And I am gay. I battled with this truth for a long time. Personally, professionally and certainly in my coaching and athletic career. It was an identity crisis that had a tremendous impact on my life. Long before I heard this presentation on Disneyland I thought about coming out in football. In the beginning, I told myself ""You\'re gay and you will take it to the grave."" Now, I\'ve come a long way since that day. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you. I\'ve come a long way since that day, but the process almost cost me my life. I chose to come out to family and friends starting in August of 2014. I told my immediate family first, and then I carefully picked my way through family and friends, trying to choose the right time and place. Only being part way out of the closet meant that I had to be two different people and always be very aware of where I was and whom I was with. It caused a constant state of panic and anxiety. So the question became, ""Is it important for me to come out publicly?"" Yes it is, and here is why. My time in-and-out of the closet helped my realize that there are other people in my situation. And it is not a pretty one. It also helped me realize that coming out is not about sharing my bedroom habits, but about giving myself permission to live my life in its entirety. Let me explain. After talking to one of my fellow coaches, he told me:  ""I don\'t talk about my sex life with players, why would you?"" And it\'s a legitimate question, but a common misconception about coming out. Again, I\'m not talking about my sex life. I\'m talking about my life. It\'s often said that your private life is your private life. But imagine you are put in a situation where going virtually anywhere and doing very normal, healthy, human activities with your significant other could have substantial consequences on your life, reputation and career. You gain a very new perspective on what your private life actually is. That\'s how being in the closet affected my life. It was quite literally a closet. No space, no freedom and no comfort. It\'s a suffocating lifestyle with measurable effects. It wore me down until eventually I was abusing alcohol and prescription medications to keep my anxiety in check. It was a horrible time in my life. When you are put in a situation of having to live a double life, it strips you off dignity and normal coping mechanisms. At that time the only place I felt somewhat safe was at home. I was living with my parents, who had been nothing but supportive, but I did not feel comfortable bringing guys around them yet. So there I was. No safe place, no place to be myself,  facing a new lifestyle I did not know how to navigate, the anxiety and depression were inescapable. And I responded the only way I felt I could at the time. Drugs and alcohol. Football teaches so many great life lessons to those who play or coach. Perseverance, toughness, respect, self-esteem. But the one negative thing that it does teach is that being gay is not OK. To be frank, the word ""faggot"" is used almost as much as the word ""football."" There is a misconception about the prominence of gay men in football, and it has serious consequences. I\'m the perfect example of this issue. An all-state player in high-school. A two-year varsity captain among a select few in school history to go play for a top tier division 1 football program. The youngest line coach in the history of the school. And I was ready to kill myself. Because I thought that even though this program was like a second family to me, I feared they would shun me. It was a crushing weight that I was carrying with me all the time. Months and months of sleep deprivation, severe anxiety and depression. And honestly, a lack of the will to live began to catch up with me. It was too much. I was desperate for a way out. Any way out. One night I reached for a bottle of vodka and a couple of pills. I didn\'t see a way out. I just wanted it to be over. If I couldn\'t be me and still live my life, what was the point? I passed out on the bathroom floor, and my mom found me. I was fortunate to wake up the next day. I escaped an overdose. It was the scariest moment of my life. When I woke up the next day, I knew I really wasn\'t ready to give up. And when I heard that talk on Disneyland, I knew how, when and why it was important for me to share my story. I worried for so long about how the football community would react. And while at this point only time will tell, my experience has given me a theory. It\'s simple. One day, being gay in football will be normal. But in order for that to happen, those of us who are gay need to stand up and own it. The coaches I know are perfect examples of this. I have been met with nothing but love and support from my fellow coaching friends. But now the challenge is to change this. And not just on the private level. The odds of a gay teen or young adult abusing drugs, alcohol, or experiencing anxiety, depression, or even attempting suicide are drastically high. When it comes to football, the social norm that we\'ve created leaves many without hope. We\'ve made incredible progress  in the equal rights movement under the law. But now we must tackle a different problem. Social equality and the message we send to young people who play football. Continue to use sports to inspire, connect and to share a positive message. A healthy person cannot live life in the dark. And if you are out there, stand up and own it. Thank you.

My siblings and I were waiting for our mom to come back from the hospital, where my grandmother was having surgery for advanced cancer. Finally, the doors opened, and my mom said, ""She didn\'t survive the operation."" She burst into tears and between sobs, said, ""Your grandmother\'s last wish was to be buried in her home, in Korea.""', '00:47': 'I was only 12 when this happened, and when I recovered from the initial shock, my mom\'s words echoed in my ears: Grandma wanted to be buried in her ""home."" We had emigrated from Korea to Argentina six years earlier. We knew no Spanish, or how we were going to make a living. We were immigrants in a new land, where we had lost everything on account of a scam, and we had worked very hard to rebuild our lives. That\'s why I couldn\'t imagine that after so many years, our home would still be Korea. It made me wonder: Where do I want to be buried someday? Where is my home? To be honest, I didn\'t have an answer to these questions, and that really worried me.', '01:50': 'This episode triggered an existential search for my identity. I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi, and I grew up in Argentina, where there was always meat on the table; truly, it would not be surprising if today I were 80 percent cow.', '02:09': '(Laughter)', '02:10': 'I was educated in the United States, where I became addicted to peanut butter. During childhood, I honestly felt very Argentine, but my appearance always gave me away.', '02:23': 'I remember the first day of high school, my literature teacher entered the classroom, carefully looked at everyone, stopped in front of me and prophesized: ""You won\'t pass this class unless you get a private tutor."" But by then, I was speaking perfect Spanish -- better than I speak it now, I think, because it\'s been years since I left. And I felt forced to choose between my Argentine identity and my Korean one. Apparently, I couldn\'t be both, and I had to abandon my previous identity in order to adopt the new one.', '03:03': ""So when I turned 18, I went to Korea to see if I could find this home that I could call my place in the world. In Korea, people assumed I was a foreigner, and they'd ask me, “Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent?”"", '03:19': '(Laughter)', '03:21': ""Apparently, I was too Korean to be Argentine, but too Argentine to be Korean. Realizing that, honestly, was very transformative. I decided not to try and change what I can't change and accept it. In fact, I was inspired by one of my grandmother's stories."", '03:42': 'My grandmother never learned Spanish, but she was very independent and managed on her own. She would walk all around the streets of Buenos Aires, even in the most dangerous areas. One afternoon, she was attacked and threatened at gunpoint. They put the gun to her head and said, ""The ring! The ring! Give me your ring!"" They wanted her gold ring, which was her most prized possession back then. Well, my grandmother looked the criminal in the eyes, sat down on the sidewalk, and a peaceful smile came onto her face. My grandmother thought they were saying ""anyó"" instead of ""ring,"" which in Korean, means ""sit down.""', '04:25': '(Laughter)', '04:26': 'She thought, ""Well, it\'s the last day of my life, so if I\'m leaving, let\'s leave with a smile."" She gracefully accepted her fate. Imagine the face of her attacker -- he must have thought my poor grandmother was a creature from another planet, and he took off running, bewildered.', '04:47': ""That experience inspired me to accept my new reality with optimism. I hadn't managed to find that place in the world that I could call home. But then I wondered: How many Koreans with Latino mannerisms that speak Korean with a Spanish accent are there in the world? Maybe it could be an advantage, a useful tool, a way to stand out in a world where things are changing very quickly, where qualities and abilities can sometimes become obsolete from one day to the next."", '05:28': ""So I decided not to focus on having 100 percent in common with people I met, Instead, I realized that I was frequently the only intersection between groups of people that didn't have much in common and that were even, at times, in conflict among themselves. So with this new perspective, I proudly accepted the different versions of myself and even, at times, allowed me to reinvent myself."", '06:02': 'For example, I have to confess that in high school I was what we call a bookworm -- I had thick glasses, had no fashion sense whatsoever. What\'s more, I think the only reason I had friends was because I let them copy my homework every morning. That\'s true. Once I went to college, I was able to find a new identity, and the ""worm"" became a popular girl. OK, granted, it was MIT, so I don\'t think the bar was very high -- (Laughter) but at least I could maintain that identity. I changed majors so many times that my advisor told me that instead of chemical engineering, I should get a degree in random studies.', '06:48': '(Laughter)', '06:50': 'Over the years, I\'ve had a lot of identities: academic, scientist, social innovator, inventor entrepreneur, investor; most recently, networker, teacher and, most importantly, a mother, three years ago. I was so confused that even my accent couldn\'t decide who it was. My friends would joke and say that it was of such an unknown origin that I was the only person in the world who spoke this language, ""Rebecanese.""', '07:24': 'Reinventing oneself can be hard. For example, when I was finishing my doctorate, I was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug. So suddenly, writing a 400-page thesis in an office in a basement seemed less appealing than starting my own company. So I had the job of telling this to my parents, who are traditional Asian immigrants -- whereas my siblings and I are the first to attend college -- in other words, that education is the most important thing in my family. You can imagine the reaction awaiting me upon telling my parents I was abandoning my studies. So I went to my parents, but with a secret weapon: a chart showing the average income of people who graduated with doctorates from Stanford compared to the average incomes of Stanford students who abandoned their thesis or doctorate. Now, I have to confess that the chart was really skewed by the founders of Google.', '08:30': '(Laughter)', '08:31': 'My mom looked at the chart and without blinking, said, ""I\'ve always said you should follow your heart.""', '08:39': '(Laughter)', '08:43': ""My search for identity these days isn't about finding my tribe. Really, it's about finding and accepting all the different possible permutations of myself. It's about cultivating diversity within myself, instead of just around me. Currently, my kids are three years old and six months old, just turned, and they were born into three nationalities and four languages -- and I need to clarify that I married a Danish guy, in case I didn't have enough cultural confusion in my life, I ended up marrying a Viking. I think my kids will be the only Vikings that won't be able to grow a beard when they grow up. It'll be hard for them."", '09:36': '(Laughter)', '09:37': ""I hope that my kids will have a multidimensionality that works for them; that they see it as a tool for creating connections in a world that's every day more global and also more divided. I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried that they don't fit into a predefined box, that they can feel free to experiment and take control of their life narratives in their own way. I hope they can use the unique combination of values, cultures, languages and abilities that they have to create a world where their identities are used to unite peoples and people, and not as an excuse to generate intolerance -- because identity can be a double-edged sword: we can use it to differentiate ourselves from others, or to find points of connection. And when we accept our multiplicity, we amplify this power of connection and forget about the differences a little."", '10:50': ""Now, back to my grandmother: her last wish was also her final life lesson for me. It turns out that after many years, I found out why she wanted to be buried in Korea. It wasn't a question of patriotism or nationality. She wanted to rest in peace next to her son, who had died many years before she emigrated to Argentina."", '11:18': ""My grandmother lived a life full of deep connections and indestructible ties, including those separated by distances or oceans or even death. She had many identities: matriarch, farmer, businesswoman, Korean, immigrant, mother, grandmother. With her last wish, she taught me that finding our home isn't about putting down roots somewhere. It's about intertwining those roots with the roots of others who enrich our lives."", '12:00': 'Thank you.', '12:01': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, I want you to picture ancient Rome. What images come to mind? The gladiators, Colosseum, Julius Caesar? Or maybe armies wearing scale mail, perhaps a bit like this. Now, I want to change your focus to a modern-day oncology unit, specifically women who are undergoing radiotherapy breast cancer treatment. Can you see a connection? Now, there\'s nothing obvious; I can grant you that, but today I would like to talk to you about two of my major science projects, both of which were inspired by the past: scale mail and ancient Egyptian water clocks, to help solve two very different problems. I\'m 16 years old, and I love science and engineering, in case you hadn\'t guessed from the T-shirt. As a scientist, I am, along with so many others, constantly thinking about where we\'ll be in five years, in 10 years, even in 50 years\' time, the question which constantly drives our curiosity and our imagination to help solve global problems with simple answers. Whether this be clean energy or health, there are major concerns facing our planet today. Now, not only is our generation going to inherit these problems, but we\'re also creating new ones for ourselves. But I believe that when it comes to coming up with solutions, we can look to the past. We can use the past to change the future, taking things that have been used before and repurposing them in a different way. Now, if you\'ve ever gone to the dentist for an X-ray, you\'ll be familiar with this scene: the dentist comes into the room, they place a lead apron over the top of you whilst they quickly jump out, and you get your X-ray. Well, this is a similar type shield that might be used if you\'re undergoing radiotherapy breast cancer treatment, but it isn\'t failsafe. The lead that they use is toxic, it costs a lot of money, and it costs a lot of time for the centers, which is why they tend to opt out of this decision. However, this means that the women who are undergoing this treatment will receive harmful unwanted radiation to their contralateral breast, which is just a fancy word for the breast that\'s not being treated, and this is an unwanted byproduct of being free of cancer. Studies have shown that one in 14 women who undergo this treatment will develop a second primary cancer in this breast later in their lifetime, which is where my idea for scale mail comes in, something which I\'ve learned about in movies and museums. Could this ancient shielding technique be more effective than what we\'re using today? Now, some early forms of scale mail were documented by the Chinese, who used them to protect their horses during battle. The Japanese samurai used to beat individual leaves, replicating that of fish scales, [which] was also found in Roman and Persian armies and is also found on this very cute animal called the pangolin, which is very effective for protection. So this is my device called the SMART armor, which stands for ""Scale Mail Armor for Radiation Therapy."" So I made this by meticulously and painfully interweaving these individual scales together, using pliers and jump rings for what felt like an eternity. So, to test my device, I used what we would consider a typical breast cancer treatment. And this was found that I could reduce doses to the contralateral breast by up to 80%, reducing the radiation levels to this breast by 80%. Now, what makes this device different, which you may have already noticed, is not only the use of scale mail, but also the use of copper. Now, I found that copper was 20% more effective at the skin level than lead, something that contradicts global standards that we should be using lead. Now, I\'ve performed all of my testing at the Chris O\'Brien Lifehouse, and I\'m overwhelmed and absolutely ecstatic at the response. It has approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, which means that it\'s ready for clinical use. I have a provisional patent on it, so don\'t go thinking you can steal it. And my paper is soon to be published in the Journal of Applied Medical Physics, which is based in North America. Now, there\'s still, of course, a lot of work to be done, but through experimentation, through curiosity, and a bit of imagination, this just shows how an ancient technology can be refocused for future scientific breakthrough. The ancient curving, conforming nature of this material made it ideal for its new purpose, potentially saving lives. Now, I\'d like to change your focus a bit to a problem where I\'ve also focused my thinking: solar panels, which are expensive to buy, difficult to install, and thus become almost impractical when helping to solve the developing world\'s great energy crisis. Many millions of dollars and thousands of researchers across the world are looking to improve solar panel efficiency by one or two percent. I discovered that I could improve a solar panel\'s power output by up to 72% through the combination of ancient technology and the modern solar panels. Now, on a different note for a second, 71% of our world is covered in water; 96.5% of this is found in the oceans. Now, of all of this water that covers our planet, only one percent is able to be drunk, and only one percent holds the basic properties needed to make it consumable. Now, I want you guys to remember this because this becomes important a little bit later. But for centuries, humans have used water to scientifically aid our existence. In 1500 BC, the ancient Egyptians created the first clock, which was a water clock where they used a water-dripping vessel which was calibrated against the movements of the Sun to tell the time. Now, interestingly enough, it was the most accurate time measurement until the 17th century, when the pendulum clock was invented. Water has also been used to further exemplify beauty and magnify what we know as beautiful and as nature. So my idea was to apply this ancient water-dropping technique to solar panels in order to make a solar panel mechanically track the Sun. It\'s called ""The Solar System."" Now, this water-drip system works by matching the water tanks on one side of the solar panel to the force and strength applied by a spring system on the other side. Now, this means that I\'m able to control the drip amount and slowly rotate the panel throughout the day, matching the path of the Sun. The Solar System could be an exciting tool for developing communities as it\'s able to provide both water and power by filtering the water once it comes out of this water-drip system. We can provide developing communities with a safe access, a safe reliable water source and power. A 72% increase in power output shows you how ancient technology can be refocused, and how we can bring the past into the future. When Thomas Edison was asked, ""How did it feel to fail countless times?"" he replied, ""I didn\'t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps."" Now, I know that I\'m going to fail, and I\'m going to be disappointed constantly, but when this happens, it just means that you need to get up, it means that you need to try harder, and it means that you need to try something different. We need to start experimenting with a childlike curiosity and imagination, which can be inspired by the past. And don\'t let anyone tell you that your age matters. Don\'t let anyone tell you that your gender matters. Anyone can find simple solutions to global problems. The answers are out there. Someone just needs to go and rediscover them. Start by using the past to change the future. Thank you.

Writer. Realistic Idealist.,"{'0:00': 'In May of this year, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue on his show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" about his newborn son who was diagnosed with a rare heart defect after an astute nurse noticed something wasn\'t quite right with the baby just hours after his birth. Kimmel sang the praises of this nurse and the entire healthcare team who cared for his son through the process of open-heart surgery. His monologue highlighted the reality that no one, not even a celebrity, is immune from unexpected health crises. At some point, each one of us will be profoundly affected by illness, be it in you, or in someone you love. And every health crisis benefits from an open-hearted nurse who is willing to come alongside the patient and family in some of the most challenging times of life. I\'m a critical care nurse, and like many of my colleagues, I went into nursing because I wanted to be a therapeutic presence for others. I envisioned the profession to be one where I lived on the highs - not from being elevated by a celebrity\'s monologue, but from feeling like I was always doing something meaningful and helpful for others. I thought that the highs alone would be enough to help me cope with the intense stress and heartache that come from taking care of so many sick and sometimes dying patients. But as I rode the roller coaster of suffering with my patients and their families, I quickly understood that I was going to need something more than the intermittent feel-good moments to sustain me through the lows. And this isn\'t just true for me. Recent literature shows that nurses everywhere are battling this challenge. Currently, 25 to 33% of critical care nurses show symptoms of severe burnout, which is not just emotional and physical exhaustion but also a feeling of personal detachment from their job. Current annual turnover rates among critical care nurses range between 13 to 20%, which is higher than the overall turnover rate for other professions. These statistics can be disheartening, given that many of us will rely on a nurse at some point in our lives. In our times of weakness, vulnerability and helplessness, we need nurses who have found a way to preserve meaning, and commitment to their work. While many external factors contributing to burnout have been studied, I\'ve been asking what we nurses are to do with the internal issue of grief - not in terms of caring for others in their grief, but working through our own grief on a deeper level as we are affected by the suffering of our patients and their families. How do I endure through the lows that come with this profession? I endure by allowing my natural response of grief to teach me its life-giving lessons. Grief kind of has a bad rap. It\'s seen as something unnatural, something to be avoided as much as possible in order to survive. It\'s seen as a thief of life. But consider this: When I spend an entire 12-hour shift with a patient who, just a few days prior, was a healthy, free-wheeling teenager who jumped into a pool the wrong way and has now been told that he will never use his arms or legs again because of a severed spinal cord, grief will be one of the most natural and predominant emotions for him, his family, and for me as his nurse. We can think of this grief like a river running downstream, and as the nurse, I\'m on this life raft together with my patient and his family. Grief is strong, it\'s scary, and no one really knows for sure where it\'s going to take us. But for this patient, his family, and for all of us, when we find ourselves in this kind of situation, it\'s natural. So if my endurance strategy as a nurse is to try to swim upstream against grief by way of suppression, and against the next stream and the next stream, I\'m not going to win. Eventually, I\'m not going to last. Rather than resisting grief and saying, ""It\'s just too hard to think about these issues,"" I can choose a different perspective as I accept the inevitable fact that I will be affected by grief. I can embrace my grief as a natural teacher about the deeper things I need in order to endure as a nurse. Resilience in the midst of exhaustion. Meaning in the midst of despair.  I can redefine my purpose.  When my initial idealism about life has been shaken, I can instead transform my grief and choose to use it to cultivate greater empathy for my patients and their families. These are the life-giving lessons of grief that can ultimately empower me to endure as a nurse. Research is slowly growing on the topic of grief in healthcare professionals. Marion Conti-O\'Hare is a nurse researcher who developed this perspective into a theory known as ""The Nurse as Wounded Healer,"" where the nurse learns to transform and rise above grief such that the nurse is all the more able to care for others. Along these lines, another researcher who studied post-traumatic stress in nurses has concluded that staying self-aware in grief and working through questions about the meaning of suffering can eventually grow the nurse in maturity and wisdom, both of which are life-giving tools for endurance. I have two daughters; they\'re two and four years old. About a year ago, I took care of a patient who reminded me a great deal of my younger child. No one could explain, beyond a suspected brain infection, what had made this child so sick to the point that he was not expected to survive. I was with his family in his final moments before we withdrew his life support. It was a privilege for me to be with his mother in her grief because I could very much imagine myself in her shoes, so in the moment, it was very intuitive to me how to care for her. But for a few weeks after that, I was shipwrecked by grief. It was difficult to function normally at home, and it was very difficult to go back to work. It was the kind of low in nursing that I simply couldn\'t anticipate, much less really prepare myself for, even years into the profession. I hadn\'t yet learned, at that point in my life and my career as a nurse, how to manage my own fairly new maternal instincts as they collided with this mother\'s grief. I couldn\'t navigate those new waters alone. It was a shipwreck moment for me. But it was also the moment when I learned my next life-giving lesson from my grief. I learned to develop new levels of life-giving relationships. Specifically, I\'ve slowly begun to find people in my life who courageously look at grief with me through this new lens, who look at grief not as a thief of life to be avoided at all costs, but as a difficult - yes - complicated - yes - but a natural, powerful, and irreplaceable teacher of endurance for my life as a nurse. There are amazing highs in nursing, like being able to walk with Jimmy Kimmel and his son through successful open-heart surgery. The purpose and joy in those experiences are clear. But when the lows come, the stress and heartache can be so strong that they can muddle motivation and make you question your ability to endure in the profession. But burnout does not have to be  the inevitable result of constantly giving oneself to the suffering of others. Allowing my natural response of grief to teach me its life-giving lessons may very well be the way in which I as a nurse can rise up and move forward with purposeful endurance in my profession.

It\'s customary for meadowlarks to sing toward the rising sun. This one, however, was mistaken by the lights of Rapid City at 2 AM. Despite being 60 miles south of the Rapid City border and well within the boundaries of Wind Cave National Park, this songbird was singing out much too late to attract a mate. Have you ever tried attracting a mate by calling them at 2 AM? (Laughter) My mother told me nothing good happens after midnight. (Laughter) So why was this songbird so confused, mistaking the bright lights of Rapid City for the rising sun at 2 AM? Improper lighting and the over-illumination of residential neighborhoods, business signage, and street lights brighten our night sky, creating an orange hue above the city for miles outside its border. Over 100 years ago, all creatures could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky. But now, eight out of ten children will never see the Milky Way from where they live. Light pollution doesn\'t only impact our view of the universe, it also impacts our environment, our individual health, and energy consumption. The three main components of light pollution include sky glow as well as glare and light trespass, which I will also explain. Glare is the excessive brightness that causes us visual discomfort. We often illuminate areas in attempt to increase safety. As children, we\'re afraid of the dark, so we flip on a night switch because ""the night is dark and full of terrors."" And as adults, we do that now on a much grander scale. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health looked at statistics where researchers studied lights that were turned on at certain hours, dimmed, or turned off completely, and found that it had no impact on traffic collisions or crime. I want you to take a very close look at this picture. Mentally note what you see. With properly shielded lights, we can actually see what was there the entire time. Brighter does not mean safer. The third component of light pollution is light trespass. To understand this, I want you to envision your bedroom. Could you sleep at night with no curtains? Or do you need those blackout shades tucked into every single crevice of that window pane, just in order to get a good night\'s sleep? If so, that is because of light trespass, the shining of light where it\'s unneeded, and unintended, and unwanted, from another source originating somewhere other than your own. Now that we\'ve looked at what causes light pollution, let\'s take a look at where light pollution is. Here is a global map with light pollution depicted by various colors. Let\'s zoom in to our local area of impact. This is Rapid City. We are on the front lines of a battle of lights versus dark. Zooming in closer to South Dakota, I want you to envision that you\'re downtown at Main Street Square, you\'ve got your blanket, your chair, you\'re ready to stargaze. And then you look up, and you realize you can see relatively very few stars. You cannot even see the Big Dipper. So you pack up all your belongings,  you get in the car, you drive to the city limits, where now you\'re in the orange zone, where eight out of ten Americans live, and we have a local observatory. You look up, you still cannot see the Milky Way. You keep on driving, you go deep into the Black Hills National Forest, and then you see it, the sky glow the meadowlark was singing toward. To get to a naturally dark sky, you would have to drive two hours north, to the corner of northwest South Dakota, an area called Slim Buttes, which has a Class 1 dark sky, a naturally lit sky, where the stars from the Milky Way shine so bright it will cast a shadow of you on the ground. Rapid City is a Class 9 sky, the brightest depicted on the map, where light pollution is 100 up to 200 times brighter than our natural darkness. You cannot make out the North Star. But the thing is Rapid City is not alone. Light pollution plagues every modern city and town. The good news, however, is that light pollution could possibly be the simplest problem to solve and could literally be done overnight, simply with the flip of a switch. So if at any point in this presentation you decide that it\'s important to protect our dark skies, I ask you to turn off your light in front of you, simply by twisting it off. Now just like in real life, here\'s a hint: You can ask your neighbor to shut off their light as well if their light is trespassing into your area and inhibiting your view of a TEDx presentation. (Laughter) Even if we all turn out our lights, more is needed to be done. One hundred years ago, this is the view from Skyline Drive you would have seen. Today, this is a picture taken this year during the Rapid City Dark Earth Hour. Which one do you prefer? So what are we going to do if we all turn out our lights and it\'s still bright? We need to protect nocturnal habitats, stargazing opportunities, and our nocturnal plants and animals. Now, bats. There\'s an idea. I know what we can do. Let\'s call Batman! He\'ll know what to do! Send the bat signal! Right? Oh, wait, maybe he didn\'t get the memo either. So let\'s shift our focus to nocturnal plants. In the Black Hills, there\'s a moonflower that blooms only in dark nights. (Music) (Music ends) Earth evolved with bright days and dark nights. Another example of nocturnal life that needs darkness is the owl. Owls see five times brighter than we do as humans because in their eyes they have light detecting rods that are numbered at one million rods per square millimeter. Just because we can see with lights at night doesn\'t mean other creatures can. But even though we can see with artificial light at night, doesn\'t mean that it\'s healthy for us. The American Medical Association states ""all creatures need darkness to survive."" As light travels through our eye, it goes to a tract of a nucleus cluster of thousands of cells that send messages to our glands. Those glands secrete a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin. The great thing about melatonin is it has great antioxidant qualities that rid our brain and body of free radicals that cause damage to our brain and body. The Journal of Epidemiology Research shows that exposure to artificial light at night has been linked to an increase in Alzheimer\'s, breast cancer, obesity, and depression. Let\'s take a look now at what our future holds. The map I showed you of South Dakota is a one from 1997, when in all reality, tonight\'s dark skies is much more closely, really, like the map of 2025. In only eight years, it\'s estimated that just eight dark sky places will remain in the United States. So if we can\'t call Batman, what are we supposed to do? OK, I have another idea, hold on with me, this is a little bit better. Let\'s join the Dark Side. Maybe Kylo Ren and Darth Vader had it right all along. But all joking aside, there really is something about the color spectrum. This is a color Kelvin chart, rating color by its temperature. The International Dark Sky Association rates colors below 3,000 Kelvins as dark sky friendly because it doesn\'t impair night vision. What else can we do? Address our fixtures, because dark skies doesn\'t have to mean dark ground. We can point lights down, where the light is intended. The International Dark Sky Association estimates that all of the outdoor lighting wastes 30 percent of light that goes outward and upward where it is not needed or intended, wasting money and creating more carbon emissions. In addition, this is a sample of a front porch light that could be converted into a full cutoff fixture, reducing glare, sky glow, and light trespass. Streetlights that point light outward and upward could be retrofitted to point the light downward. Paris, the City of Light, took solving light pollution to a whole new level. They enacted a lights-out curfew of 1 AM or one hour past the last employee\'s departure time. I challenge you to find your reason for #LightsOut. I wish you all a very dark night.

""My body belongs to me"" has become a statement so banal that French ministers have the phrase tattooed on their arms. Philosopher Gaspard Koenig thinks we should stop taking ownership of our bodies for granted. In this funny, example-driven talk, Koenig delves into the myriad ways we lose agency over our mortal flesh to legal, moral and corporate authorities. (In French with English subtitles)",,,33552,2018-05-25T15:11:44+00:00,"['identity', 'life', 'self', 'philosophy', 'biology', 'bioethics', 'TEDx']","['Eesti keel', 'English', 'Español', 'Français']",Gaspard Koenig,Philosopher,"{'0:00': 'I\'d like to start by showing you someone who is dressed even worse than I am. [Who is this?] You may notice, aside from the color harmony, a tattoo saying: ""My body belongs to me."" But who is this person? Is it a punk, who borrowed clothes from their grandmother\'s wardrobe? Is it a teenager, from the 16th arrondissement of Paris, who feels like rebelling? No. This is our Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, standing on the steps of the Élysée. And this was last year, to celebrate the 40th year of the Veil Abortion Act, which enables women to take control of their bodies, through a voluntary interruption of their pregnancy. ""My body belongs to me"" has become banal -- everyone says it. By the way, for once, the entire National Assembly has voted in favor of a symbolic law in order to reapprove the Veil Law. It\'s a banality, even ministers have it tattooed on their arm. However, it\'s not entirely true. I would like to give you a few examples, that are a little extreme, honestly even shocking, which will demonstrate that for many people and in a lot of cases, well, my body doesn\'t belong to me. Firstly, it doesn\'t belong to me as long as I\'m alive. I am not allowed to rent my belly. I am not allowed in many countries to sell my sexuality. I am not allowed to define the gender that I belong to, since I have to face a doctor or be in front of a judge, and declare to the civil registrar whether I am a man, woman, or other. I am also not allowed to do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I can\'t do this. [Dwarf-tossing] So, You might recognize Leonardo Di Caprio, in this great dwarf-tossing scene. But some versions of it exist that are a little less chic, notably the one that was practiced by the great community of Morsang-sur-Orge from l\'Essonne, in the beginning of the 90s. The mayor of Morsang-sur-Orge said: ""This can\'t go on -- we can\'t toss dwarfs.""\x94 And so he prohibited dwarf-tossing. And who was to protest? Dwarf-tossers found other activities to do on Sundays. They probably went back to fishing. It\'s the dwarves themselves who protested, because they had a breadwinner, and a certain renown, apparently a certain success with women. And the Morsang-sur-Orges Council of State\'s decision, which jurists know well, said: ""No, this is forbidden."" I also cannot do whatever I want with my body in order to die. I am not allowed to be euthanized, but I am also not allowed to be eaten. In 2001, a charming German engineer posted an announcement saying: ""I am looking for a volunteer to eat."" He received several candidates, made a selection, conducted a few final interviews, and in the end finally found Bernt, who agreed wholeheartedly. So they began by cutting off Bernt\'s genital and eating it together, probably by candlelight. (Laughter) Obviously satisfied by this first course, they chose to proceed -- and by the way this all on video so you can watch it. I recommend it to you, it\'s really nice -- ""Armine ate Bernt."" But be aware that this is prohibited. It\'s crazy, considering they haven\'t hurt anyone. But it is indeed prohibited to be eaten. Well, even after my death I can\'t do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I am not allowed to practice sea-immersion whereas diving is allowed while I am alive. I am also not allowed to be embalmed, unless my name is Lenin, Mao, or Valéry Giscard d\'Estaing. (Laughter) (Applause) And I am also not allowed -- and this is even worse -- to be cryogenized. You know, some people -- have themselves frozen, hoping that in 10 years, 100 years, or a million years, we would defrost them, as by then we will have already found ways to resuscitate them, or found cures to the illnesses that have killed them. This has been somewhat a success. In Russia and the United States, there are some cryogenic sites, where one can see the coffins. Some put their entire body, while others only their head -- it\'s cheaper. (laughter) And in France, a doctor named Martineau, felt that it was a great idea to freeze his wife first. (Laughter) And as it seemed to be going well, he decided to follow her with the freezing. Forever united in a frozen sleep, inside a castle. And then someone found out and filed a complaint: There are some people frozen in the village, do you realize that?\x94 (Laughter) Their son was delighted. He would go to see them from time to time. It\'s better than gathering around a grave. And the Council of State, that same one, said: ""This can\'t be happening. You need to defrost and burn them! Put it all on fire. Then there was a trial, and Martineau\'s son was forced to burn his parents. Can you imagine, this poor couple who imagined being united for millions of years and resuscitate in a future where sexuality is completely open, completely vivified and rejuvenated. Well, unfortunately, there is only a heap of ashes left. (Laughter) So behind these tragedies -- they don\'t concern us all if we don\'t wish to be eaten, frozen, or tossed -- who cares. But the problem is that it actually applies to each one of us. It\'s the Civil Code via the bioethics law of 1994 that says so. The conventions -- as you can read -- are that there is no private ownership or patrimoniality over the body, because we say that the person is unavailable under law. And so the body itself isn\'t patrimonial. You don\'t have an ownership of your body. And so you might tell me: ""So what, everything in France is forbidden anyway."" (Laughter) But even in the US, a country supposedly liberal, it\'s the same story. It has, by the way, been declared very clearly at a trial in the Supreme Court of California. The John Moore case. John Moore was a patient suffering from leukemia, in the 80s, and the doctors had to remove his spleen. They discovered that his cells had extraordinary properties for producing certain kind of proteins. So the doctors extracted, without telling John Moore, many of his cells. They extracted blood, sperm, and parts of the spinal cord. They apparently told him that in order to treat his leukemia they had to remove some sperm -- that\'s apparently what happened. (Laughter) And they made a cell line out of it. John Moore\'s cell line. Which they then sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars to big pharmaceutical institutions. And John Moore, upon realizing what has happened, said: ""Wait a minute, I don\'t get to have a say? These are my cells, if you don\'t mind."" And so there was a big trial, and the judge concluded that, no, they aren\'t his cells in fact, given that he doesn\'t have ownership over his cells. So, where does all of this come from? There are good reasons to think that it came from a monotheistic heritage. This idea -- as Saint Paul put it: ""The body is for the Lord and the Lord is for the body."" -- is that in the big monotheism, particularly within Judeo-Christian religions, my body doesn\'t belong to me because it belongs to God. My body is the expression of the soul, as per Thomas d\'Aquin. The body is the reflection of my soul, my soul is immortal. It joins the kingdom of heaven. By the way, I can even be resuscitated if the Council of State hasn\'t burned me first. (Laughter) Pope Pie XII has claimed it very explicitly -- this is the first time I\'m quoting Pope Pie XII publicly. In 1954, at a medical congress, he explained that Man is merely a usufructuary of his body, not its full owner. So within our secular law system, a secularized system, it is not a matter of God anymore, well the concept of God has been replaced by the concept of dignity. Going back to that trial in Morsang-sur-Orge, this is the reason why the Council of State has prohibited dwarf-tossing, because a human being\'s dignity is viewed as being part of the public order. It means that today, this transcendence we have abolished, this divine transcendence, is being retaken by the State, or by society if you prefer, defining everyone\'s dignity. So dignity is sacredness without God. It\'s the idea that, nonetheless, the body is sacred. We cannot do whatever we want with it. I suggest that you try and go to the end of the modernity logic. And if we are really, completely within immanence, to whom does the body belong, if not to me? Who can define its dignity, if not me? That\'s what John Lock did, not John Moore, but John Locke. Indeed, there are many Johns. He was the first person to have written, to my knowledge, that each person has ownership over their own personhood. It\'s not a coincidence that he is the one who wrote that, He was a doctor, and well-acquainted with flesh, the body\'s reactions. And also because he was in the midst of the glorious British revolution, the Bill of Rights Revolution. So this whole theory about social contract rights, about elementary, fundamental rights, about civil disobedience, also means that one has natural rights that are predetermined among which, the right of ownership of oneself. He went even further by saying: ""If can have ownership over exterior things, if I can acquire the world by working on it, by adding value to it,"" -- this idea of property was first born out of the appropriation of myself. And think about it, if we have ownership over the body, we have, according to classical themes, the usus, fructus and abusus. Usus means -- it\'s always nice using Latin terms -- usus means usage. So if I have usus over the body, the dwarfs can do their work with dignity. Then, fructus, we have it fructified and so John Moore can have access to his cell money. And then you have abusus, I can abuse it and do whatever I want with it, and if I want to have it cryogenized, that\'s my problem. It appears to me that this new generation is a generation that rejects predetermined structures, one that wants to define their own career, that wants to define their life by traveling, and to build themselves, their own self, be their own creator. And we can see, anecdotally, sociologically, to what extent this generation who appropriates their own body with tattoos for instance, It\'s also a way to define one\'s sexuality in a much more fluid way. There is a study that came out which showed that generation Z - it\'s not even Y anymore, it\'s Z -- Generation Z is post-gender. It\'s not even bi anymore, everyone defines their own sexuality by adding a little bit of this or that. So this results in many things. For instance, one can be half-sexual, Grey-sexual, gyno-sexual, pan-sexual, Strauss-Kahn sexual -- No, not that. Anyway, there are many versions. I don\'t know all of them, and can\'t describe them on stage. But it\'s interesting, you should look them up. And more importantly, it will allow us to tackle the three big themes of the future: The subject of human augmentation, the enhancement of oneself, the theme of transhumanism, and the theme of data. If tomorrow I can, and I already can enhance myself, that\'s to say building my own artificial arms, enhancing my limbs, enhancing my brain abilities, even modifying my own DNA. If I modify my own DNA, I must be its owner. If tomorrow I want to test, I want to explore immortality, be it through cryogenisation -- here is that nice example again. Or for instance, as Ray Kurzweil, the Pope of transhumanism, envisions it, by transferring my consciousness onto a USB key. Well, similarly, I am going to define, even contractually, the way in which my body relates to the world. And then there is a third question that might seem a little marginal, the question of data. We produce, a large amount of data, and its value is humongous. as in Europe, it\'s estimated be worth a thousand billion euros by 2020. However, this data, which is worth so much money and with which some companies make so much money, well, your personal data doesn\'t belong to you. In the same way there isn\'t a patrimoniality of the body, there isn\'t a patrimoniality of data. For the exact same reasons, because data is considered to be an expression of your personality, and as we saw, within the law, the personality is inalienable and the body isn\'t patrimonial. If tomorrow we find, that we are able to build a private property for data, which will be to the digital age what intellectual property was to the industrial revolution, you will then become an owner, in truly legal and financial terms, of your own data, which you will be able to negotiate. In other words: you will finally get paid for using Facebook. So, ""my body belongs to me"" isn\'t a platitude. It\'s a tattoo we would finally all wear. Because this brand new generation will have to confront all these problems. Transhumanism is coming, bioethical committees are already outdated. And in order for everyone to able to choose their own values, in this complex universe, we must first own our own bodies.

I\'d like to talk to you about laughter and the importance of laughter as a skill. And to do so, I\'m going to start by discussing some American foreign policy because that\'s always - (Laughter) absolutely hilarious. (Laughter) Back in 1995, towards the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia, they\'d been a very ill-tempered speech given by Boris Yeltsin at the UN about the involvement of the Russian Federation in NATO, and then he had a meeting with Bill Clinton, in which some of these same issues were coming up, and it was considered to be, likely to be a bit of a row. So, what actually happened when these two men came out? They gave a press conference about their summit. And can we learn anything about laughter if we watch this? (Video) Host: Good afternoon. Bill Clinton: Mr. President. (On stage) Sophie Scott: Watch Bill Clinton. (Video) Boris Yeltsin: (In Russian) Ladies and gentlemen, SS: Yeltsin - (Video) BY: (In Russian) dear journalists, SS: ... doesn\'t sound very happy. (Video) BY: (In Russian) First of all, I have to say that I was coming to this meeting at the invitation of the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, not with the same optimism as I am feeling right now. Interpreter: I want to say, first of all, that when I came here to the United States for this visit at the invitation of the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, I did not, at that time, have the degree of optimism with which I now am departing. BY: And this is all because of you - SS: (Laughter) (Video) BY: because even in all today\'s newspapers, based on my yesterday\'s statement at the United Nations, you predicted that our meeting today would be a failure. Interpreter: And this is all due to you, because coming from my statement yesterday in the United Nations, and if you looked at the press reports, one could see that what you were writing was that today\'s meeting with President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster. (Laughter) SS: A big laugh. (Video) BY: And now, for the first time, I\'m telling you that you have failed. Interpreter: But now, for the first time, I can tell you that you\'re a disaster. (Laughter) SS: Enormous laugh. (Laughter) Helpless with the laughter. (Laughter) (Video) BC: Be sure you get the right attribution there. (Laughter) SS: Boris Yeltsin now starts laughing. (Laughter) (Laughter) No one\'s able to get anything done for a while now. That tends to happen with laughter. (Laughter) (Laughter) These guys. (Laughter) So what is laughter? Clearly, that was quite an enjoyable thing in a rather surprising setting. Laughter, actually, is a very interesting behaviour. We tend to associate it with comedy and humour, but laughter is primarily a social behaviour. You\'re 30 times more likely to laugh with somebody else than if you\'re on your own. And frequently, this means your laughter happens when you\'re in conversation, because that tends to be what happens when you\'re with other people. And very often, that laughter is simply contagious laughter. You laugh just because other people are laughing. You just catch a laugh. You\'re much more likely to catch a laugh from someone you know than someone you don\'t know, and in conversations. We\'re still currently not laughing at jokes and humour with punchlines necessarily. We\'re laughing to show agreement. We\'re laughing to show understanding. We\'re laughing to show that we agree and we see where somebody\'s coming from. We share that experience. We laugh much more with people we know and people we feel comfortable around. We laugh - we don\'t laugh rather if we\'re feeling exposed or we\'re feeling awkward. When we\'re comfortable, when we can relax, when we\'re with people familiar to us, people we like, people with whom we share affection, we laugh even more. When we\'re children, we learn to laugh, and we learn to laugh primarily in play. And play is a very important behaviour, and we frequently use laughter to indicate that we are playing. The same behaviour could simply be pure aggression (Laughter) where not for the marking of it as play. And this is done with laughter primarily. We will use laughter, not just to show that we\'re part of the same group of somebody - we like them, we understand them, we agree with them. We will also use laughter to sort of show we understand that they may be trying to make us laugh; we pick up on their intentions. And we\'ll also use laughter to try and control situations. We\'ll use laughter to try and make ourselves feel better. And it only works if everybody joins in. If one person\'s going, ""Hahahahaha,"" and no one else is laughing, that tends not to make anybody feel better at all. (Laughter) If everybody joins in, laughter is actually an effective way of improving the positive mood of a group of people. And people can use laughter because of this link, with sort of de-escalation from stress. People will use laughter to show that they\'re OK. ""I\'m angry that you\'ve poured yellow paint all over me. I\'m delighted. This is exactly how I hoped my day would go."" (Laughter) Charles Darwin, very interestingly, got a lot of stuff right about the sort of how we started to look at emotions in the study of psychology over the next 150 years after his writing. He wrote about things like anger and disgust and fear, but he also wrote a lot about laughter, and we largely ignored that. There\'s actually very, very little scientific research into laughter. But Charles Darwin thought that laughter was really important, and he thought that at its heart, it was an expression of joy; it\'s a joyful emotion. And it\'s joy in play, it\'s joy in company, it\'s joy in the company of those we love. I think it\'s really important to think about that when we think about laughter. We also think about how that could go wrong. Because we learn to laugh. Babies will laugh when they\'re tickled or somebody plays peek-a-boo with them. But it\'s a behaviour we can encourage. We learn what laughter means. We learn to understand laughter. And we can see that going wrong. So this is a study that I did with my colleague Essi Viding at UCL last year, where we were studying teenage boys who are at risk of psychopathy. They have conduct disorders, and they have high inputs called callous-unemotional traits. So they\'re not behaving well, and they don\'t care if they hurt people. And what we find, when they listen to laughter compared to control teenage boys, who are normally developing, is that behaviourally, they don\'t find laughter contagious. They don\'t join in when somebody else laughs, and they don\'t want to join in when somebody else laughs. If we look at their brain where normally, when people hear laughter, you can see this priming response, you can see people getting ready to join in, they show a significantly reduced effect. Now, we don\'t know, in this context, if we\'re seeing this because those boys have always had a problem learning to laugh because of these conduct disorders and these callous-unemotional traits that they have, has that affected how they engage with laughter, or have they never had the opportunity to learn to laugh? Had they not been laughed with? Have they not been played with? Of course, we need a lot more research to look into this. There\'s an even more extreme condition called ""gelotophobia,"" where people not only don\'t want to join in when they hear laughter, they are actively frightened and respond aggressively to laughter. They\'re the kind of person who\'s walking down the streets, hears laughter, think they\'re being laughed at and they punch that person. And you never find gelotophobia outside of the most profound psychological disturbances. So in fact, we can see laughter and the reaction to laughter spanning a huge different quality and properties of human experience, and kind of lives that we can live.  It can be an incredibly positive social tool, or it can be something that you fear depending on your experiences. So, thinking about that, can we go back to that bit of film and think about why on earth Bill Clinton was laughing. Well, from the start, he\'s watching Boris Yeltsin like a hawk. All his attention is on him. And he looks like - actually, he\'s waiting for a reason to laugh. And then he gets his reason, because Boris Yeltsin says his name, Bill Clinton, and he laughs then. It\'s pure laugh of recognition: ""Yes, ha ha ha, my name is Bill Clinton."" (Laughter) Don\'t knock it, if it gets a laugh, it gets a laugh. So that\'s his reason. He\'s got going. And then Boris Yeltsin says the line about that you thought it would be a disaster but you\'re the disaster. Actually, that\'s a mistranslation; he used the word ""failure,"" and it\'s mistranslated by the Russian-American interpreter. People have said that Bill Clinton is laughing at this mistranslation. I don\'t know if that\'s giving, but possibly he is. Most people probably didn\'t pick up on that. It\'s likely that he\'s now just using that as a reason both to escalate the laughter and also to reframe what is quite an insulting comment by Boris Yeltsin as a joke. He\'s de-escalating the situation and he\'s re-presenting it to us as: This guy is hilarious. (Laughter) It completely changes our perception and importantly Boris Yeltsin\'s perception of what\'s going on. Boris Yeltsin, ""So yeah, I am killing it here."" (Laughter) ""This is very funny.""  (Laughter) And he carries on; he now gets a smile out of Yeltsin who cracks, and then he gets his laugh. Boris Yeltsin starts to laugh, and he is laughing primarily here through pure contagion. For a while, they\'re both incapacitated by the laughter, and that happens with laughter; it will stop you doing anything else for a short amount of time. And then they go back. OK, they\'re doing OK. So why - why was Bill Clinton laughing? Well, we\'ve got the recognition, and then we\'ve got the the kind of comment, the joke of reframing, and that\'s actually really important. He is de-escalating and reframes the whole thing. The atmosphere was tense, and he turns that into a positive situation. So he\'s de-escalating the stress, and he\'s just reframing everything as ""This is great fun we\'re having, and this is just hilarious. This guy\'s so funny."" He\'s also showing that he is quite comfortable in that situation. We don\'t laugh when we feel exposed or awkward. So Clinton\'s showing he\'s confident: ""This is fine. You guys might have been worried about this. I know we\'re golden. This guy\'s hilarious."" And that really matters to us. We learn, when we are very, very young, to use our parents laughter as a way of working out whether a situation is serious or not. Children of 12 months old will use their parents laughter, or their absence of laughter, to work out if an unfamiliar situation is something they should worry about. We continue doing that, so it matters that Bill Clinton is doing this. And he\'s also showing that he\'s affiliated with Yeltsin. He\'s showing that he feels affection towards him. And Yeltsin does the same thing. We don\'t catch laughs off people we don\'t like. We don\'t catch laughs off people we don\'t know. So actually, they\'re marking their bond there. And the final point that I think is really intriguing is Bill Clinton, at no stage, makes it look like he\'s laughing at Boris Yeltsin. He goes to great pains to include him. He\'s not going, ""This guy is an idiot. Let\'s laugh at him."" It would mean something very, very different if he did. In fact, I think generally, in American foreign policy, anybody\'s foreign policy, don\'t laugh in the face of a premier state from another country. It\'s probably eight-o\'clock day-one of a rule. He includes him in that laughter. And this is a really important factor about laughter. Because laughter is about making and maintaining social bonds, people are very cautious about working out where they are in relation to that. And this does mean you can\'t just take a difficult situation and throw a squirt of laughter at it; you\'ve got to make sure people feel included in that laughter. They\'re not feeling excluded or offended by that laughter. And this leads us back to perhaps a more important aspect of laughter. It\'s an important social skill that we learn to do. We learn about the social use of laughter throughout our entire early adult life, and it\'s probably one of the more important social skills that we acquire. And we should probably take this a lot more seriously. We should think about the things that can affect our laughter. We can think about the things that we could do to encourage our understanding of our laughter. And perhaps the takeaway message is take laughter seriously. Think about your laughter. Don\'t undervalue or trivialise your laughter. It matters. It matters a lot. It can sound like friendship. It can sometimes sound a lot like love. Thank you.

She wants us to reconnect, to understand how energy drives our world: ""Energy makes everything we do possible, yet we treat it as an insignificant other."" In an energetic talk, Wirfs-Brock shows us the four things we need to know about the energy we use.",,,30851,2018-12-06T00:24:19+00:00,"['sustainability', 'energy', 'electricity', 'social change']","['English', 'Español', 'Magyar', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)']",Jordan Wirfs-Brock,Energy Storyteller,"{'0:00': 'I\'m an energy journalist and a self-proclaimed energy nerd, but today, if you\'re cool with it, I\'d like to try out a new career, and you guys are going to be my guinea pigs. I\'ll be taking on the role of relationship counselor. Okay, okay. I\'m talking about our relationship with energy, with electricity, gasoline, wind turbines, all of it. Or rather, for most of us, it\'s a lack of a relationship. See, us and energy, we don\'t talk. We\'re disconnected, estranged. Here\'s an example: When I first started covering energy, I asked a bunch of friends what questions they had. And one of my best friends, a physics professor, super smart, asked: ""Are we still burning coal?"" And I was like, huh. Are we still burning coal? Here we were, a physics PhD and an energy journalist with an engineering degree, stumped. Because here\'s the thing, ""Are we still burning coal?"" is a totally reasonable question. It\'s so easy to go through life using energy every day, every moment, while knowing next to nothing about it. Energy makes everything we do possible, and yet we treat it as an insignificant other. And because us and energy, we don\'t really talk, we\'re embarrassed to even ask questions like, ""Are we still burning coal?"" And in case you\'re curious, yes, we are; a lot of it. As a journalist, though, I get this amazing license to ask questions, however basic. And I\'ve spent nearly three years asking questions to everyone from power grid engineers to energy economists. What have I learned? It\'s a problem that most of us are on the outs with energy. I don\'t have to remind you that we\'re facing some major energy challenges, and we can\'t solve them if we treat energy as an insignificant other. But there\'s good news. The tools we need to rekindle the relationship are already here. So, to kick off our counseling session, let\'s take a step back and figure out how we ended up with this energy estrangement, this communication breakdown. What is energy, anyway? That\'s a good place to start. The physics definition in five words: energy is the capacity to do work. All that means is anything that has to move or change, energy is the stuff that makes it possible. It comes in many forms. Chilling a beer in your fridge, that takes energy. The beer itself: energy too, calories. While drinking said beer, brainstorming what you\'re going to be for Halloween, neurons are moving around in your brain using energy. And making that sweet Oompa Loompa costume - (Laughter) more energy. Yeah, that\'s me. (Laughter) No, this is important: We can move energy around, change it from one form to another, like when we burn coal to make electricity, but we can never create or destroy it. Pending advancements in space travel, what\'s here on earth and what\'s coming from the sun, that\'s all we got. Okay, on to our relationship history, the movie montage version. Jumping to pre-agricultural humans, 50,000 years ago or so, we took in energy as food, plants and animals, and we used it by doing stuff: chopping wood, going for a walk. We straight-up humans were our own industrial complex. A power plant, factory, supercomputer all rolled into one kick-ass body. And our energy use was limited by how much we could eat and how much we could move: a few thousand calories a day. Then, big breakthrough: we domesticated animals, using them as batteries, essentially storing energy for us. Now, we\'re commanding energy outside our bodies. Then comes the water wheel, the windmill, we invent the steam engine, we\'re burning coal, and by 1900, not that long ago, we\'re here, using about 12,000 calories a day per person. Then we built the modern electric grid, the world\'s largest machine, we figure out nuclear power, we\'ve got the ability to send humans to the freaking moon, finally the digital revolution, those giant data servers off in the desert, and boom: here we are in 2016, where each American uses the equivalent of 208,000 calories a day. Seriously. It\'s like we\'ve each got a 100-person battalion at our disposal. It\'s on the order of the energy in a lightning bolt. We\'re all Zeuses! And most of this change happened in barely more than a century. So, as we turned into Zeuses, how did our relationship change? Well, I can tell you exactly what it felt like in the pre-Zeus era. No, I\'m not a time traveler, but I do run ultramarathons. Last month, I- woo, yeah! I ran a hundred mile race in the mountains of Idaho, up and down mountains, over scree, through mud. (Applause) Thank you! (Applause) (Cheers) For almost 29 hours, burning 15,000 calories, give or take. And during that ordeal, energy and me, we were super tight. I had my caloric intake planned out to the minute, and I was constantly checking in. Eat this gel now, back off the pace, drink more water, go hard down that hill, no, not that hard, now you\'re getting bloated, and oh! There comes the vomit!  (Laughter) You can only ramp up a human power plant so much before it breaks down. And to avoid that, I had to be intimately connected with my energy. I imagine maybe that\'s what it was like to be a human, hundreds of years ago. But now, as our energy use skyrocketed, we grew less aware of it. We stopped constantly checking in, and we began to blindly trust our energy. We went from using things we could see and touch, to using machines operating hundreds of miles away. Say you want to make a peanut butter banana smoothie and you turn on a blender. That blender is connected to the outlet, the substation down the street, the transmission lines; it\'s an uninterrupted chain all the way back to a power plant. And when you hit blend, a generator in that power plant spins slightly faster or slower to accommodate you. For real! But you don\'t see that, right? You just see the smoothie. That invisible system, it\'s like magic. You trust that it\'ll work. Over the past century, we left that close, instinctual energy awareness behind, and we began to blindly trust our energy. And as we did, we took that relationship for granted. And that\'s how energy became our insignificant other. So, implications... Well, as we grew to think about our energy systems less, we also grew to depend on them more. And that dependency only shows itself when energy\'s gone, when the power goes out and you find yourself eating a cold can of beans for dinner. Now here\'s what\'s dangerous: not just that our energy appetites have grown, but that most of us don\'t realize how much they\'ve grown, or what our energy appetites even are, so that when we need to tackle challenges involving our energy, we\'re so disengaged, we\'ve got no idea where to start. When I was running that hundred mile race, I hit some energy complications. Remember the vomit? But, I was able to handle them because I was dialed in to my energy. In any relationship, problems will pop up. With energy, these involve climate change,  the economy, geopolitics, energy poverty. The crux of a good relationship is being able to face problems, together. But when it comes to our energy, how can we face problems if we\'re not even on speaking terms? There are all kinds of technological fixes out there, but they\'ll be rendered useless if we can\'t change the relationship. Relax, take a breath. I\'m not going to leave you with bleakness. As your energy relationship counselor, I\'ve got some practical advice, but as I said, this is a new role for me, so I consulted the WikiHow illustrated guide on how to fix a relationship in four easy steps. Because of course that exists, right? Okay. Step one: understand the problem. Well, just by being here, you\'ve got a great start. With energy, a key problem is that we\'ve grown habituated to having such a fabulous, reliable partner, a partner we took for granted, so we stopped checking in. Which brings us to step two: learn to discuss better. (Laughter) There\'s no need to bottle up those energy questions. It\'s okay to ask, ""Are we still burning coal?"" or ""Can I put a wind turbine on my house?"" And you can practice some listening skills too. Maybe next month actually read your utility bill, the one you\'ve got setup on auto-pay. (Laughter) It\'s okay, I do too. So, communication, it takes two sides, and that poor communication we\'re accustomed to, it\'s not actually your fault. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to have a real discussion with your energy even in your own home. Utilities track every bit of electricity from a power plant to your house, but your house itself is a black box. There\'s no itemized list on that bill you get, so how much goes to your computer, your lights, or poof! just dissipated as lost heat, who knows? That\'s changing. Advancements like smart meters and smart appliances, these let us peek inside the black box. But, information alone will not repair our broken relationship, so step three: you\'ve got to reconnect. Things like holding hands and gazing into each others\' eyes, these can go a long way toward rekindling the flame. Let\'s be real, energy is not the only relationship in our lives so those ways to reconnect need to be simple, and they can\'t add to our information overload. Here\'s a fun one I\'ve been trying: going back to those 208,000 calories a day we each consume, pick an activity, say, binge-watching the latest season of Orange is the New Black. And now think, if I had to eat the amount of calories that matched the energy my TV uses, it would be a nice big slice of chocolate cake, and that\'s not even counting those data servers off in the desert. So, you don\'t need cutting edge technology to reconnect, you just need a creative, open mind. Slipping on your energy goggles and starting to see those connections out in the world, it will change your relationship. So, we\'ve understood the problem, we\'re discussing better, we\'re practicing that connection. Now we\'re ready for step four: figuring out how to move forward. I\'m really excited for the future. Our relationship with energy is changing on a personal level and a societal one too. The 20th century grid was designed to be magic and invisible, to keep energy at a distance. But innovations happening now can bring you back into the relationship. Things like electricity prices that change dynamically, the ability to generate and store power in your own home, detailed data on our energy behavior, these things can drastically reduce our energy use and costs, but getting them right requires us all taking a more active role in our relationship. You don\'t have to be like me running a hundred mile race and constantly obsessing over your energy. But you can check in every once and a while. Because when we treat energy as a significant other, a true partner, instead of just seeing energy problems, we\'re able to see energy solutions. Thank you!

I\'m here to talk about dogs, but more specifically, I\'m here to talk about bad dogs, and why I love them. I\'m a conservation biologist, meaning I study weird species and try to count them. And I\'m also a trainer of detection dogs, and where those two worlds meet is where I live, and where I work. Most of the dogs that we get for this kind of work, we scour shelters for because these are bad dogs, and they don\'t make great pets. And you know these dogs. You go to your friend\'s barbecue, and that dog comes up, and she is so happy to see you she pees on your feet, and she drops this big, slabbery ball in your lap, and you just throw it to try to get as much distance between yourself and this dog as possible, and it comes back, and then by 950th throw you\'re just thinking, ""Oh, just why didn\'t they get rid of this dog?"" And often they do. They end up in shelters because they often have this overwhelming desire to bring you things. (Laughter) They think that you\'re really enjoying this. The dog is so happy, thinking that you\'re all enjoying this game because you\'re throwing something and it\'s bringing it to you. And they\'re telling you where this thing is, and that\'s what we\'ve asked them to do over the evolution of time, our companionship with dogs, we\'ve asked them to bring us stuff. And they do a great job. They bring us our livestock, and they bring us food and game, and this is the only species on the planet that can be bothered to bring us stuff and bothered to tell us what they know. I mean you can ask a camel or a bear, or you can ask your cat, and you get nothing. (Laughter) But dogs love telling you what they know. And the ones that really really really love this, they are over the top, they have this unbelievable energy, just unrelenting go and drive. And we categorize that often as just a reject dog. It is just too much, it\'s destructive, it\'s all of these things. But those are the characteristics I like to work with in dogs. Inability to quit: it\'s not even a desire, it\'s an inability to quit, It\'s what resilience is. For a dog that doesn\'t stop, you can train that dog to do lots of things and bring you information. I\'d like to tell you a little bit about this particular dog, his name is Ruger. And he\'s a really bad dog. He is the first anti-poaching dog in Zambia, lives right next to a national park where animals are being poached and snared and trafficked out of the park, and even, you know, elephant ivory from the Congo Basin is moving through Tanzania and through Zambia out to ports to be shipped abroad. And this dog is trained to find ivory and rhino horn, bush meat, other wild life contraband and guns and ammunition. I trained him, and I found him to be a horrible dog. He bit and snapped at people, he was scary to approach, he was everything you fear in a dog, and it turns out he was going blind. So I take this dog to Zambia, and I pair him with these scouts who don\'t have any history of having pets or being with dogs except throwing rocks at village dogs. And they learned to think of this dog as a colleague. And after four months of intensive training with dogs, they started setting up roadblocks and looking for illegal contraband being trafficked in vehicles along the roads outside this park. And they checked vehicles, and by a human doing it, it can take hours, especially for a bus loaded with luggage and food, like this one up in the top corner. And Ruger just checked it in a few minutes as this is their first practice training on a roadblock. And he alerted, which means he sat, and he stared at his handler, and the handler was like, ""Oh, dear!"" They searched it, looked through it, and they found nothing, and so their spirits dropped. But they unloaded that minivan, and they have luggage out, and again Ruger picked a piece of luggage and he sat, and they searched through it and found nothing. And Ruger insisted, and they went back, and then Ruger hit on a tiny matchbox wrapped in a plastic bag inside clothes. And inside that matchbox was a primer cap, which is an illegal firing pin for a handmade rifle. And so everyone, all the passengers on that bus, all the scouts, they suddenly believed. They believed that Ruger knew what he was doing because he didn\'t quit. He has an even more interesting backstory.  He came off of an Indian reservation, the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. And he was a horrible puppy, and the owner of this litter shot all of the dogs. Somehow Ruger escaped, he ended up in a shelter in Helena. Someone found him and noticed how bad he was and brought him to us to be trained as a conservation detection dog. He has made a huge difference. Because of his unrelenting energy and desire to work and love of work, he brings us amazing information. Then there is another dog I\'d like you to meet. His name is Pepin, and he is with our executive, Dr. Pete Coppolillo, who is going to tell you a little bit more, and I\'m going to work Pepin for you. PC: Well, Megan, Pepin get ready. I\'ll give you a little update on Ruger. The four months after he made his first find in the minibus, he detected and the scouts he works with confiscated 15 guns. Mostly homemade muzzleloaders, which are their gun of preference for elephant poaching. They\'re also used because guns are hard to come by in Africa, by sometimes seven, sometimes 10, sometimes more different poachers. So, as of now, there may be 100-150 different poachers who are out of business thanks to Ruger. (Applause) (Cheers) And for these exceptional, really high-drive dogs, you know, Ruger is really the rule rather than the exception. And I\'ll tell you about a couple more. This is Seamus. Seamus is trained to detect dyer’s woad, which is the weed that\'s in that pot there. And speaking of resilience, dyer’s woad drops between 12,000 and 15,000 seeds a year. So it\'s a noxious weed,  and when it gets established, it\'s very hard to get rid of. So people were working on getting rid of it on Mount Sentinel in Missoula for about 10 years, and they weren\'t making any progress. So in 2011, we brought in Seamus. And Seamus is able to do something that we human searchers can\'t, which is find it by smell before it flowers. Seamus has knocked back dyer’s woad by over 95 percent.  Thanks to him, we\'re going to do something that was unthinkable just a few years ago, which is eradicate a noxious weed, a bad infestation of a noxious weed. And this is Wicket. Wicket is one of the best stories. She was in a shelter in Anaconda, Montana, and when we came to get her, the director of the shelter said, ""You don\'t want that dog. That dog is crazy."" (Laughter) And now Aimee famously said, ""I think she might be the right kind of crazy."" Wicket is now the most accomplished conservation detection dog in the world. She\'s worked on three continents, she\'s worked in dozens of US states, and here she is searching a boat for zebra mussels which have a microscopic larval stage that we can\'t see. Speaking of accomplished and crazy, (Laughter) now you guys will get to watch Pepin do his thing. So Meg\'s put his vest on. That is his signal that it\'s time to work. You can see he\'s low-focused. (Laughter) He is ready to go. So I hid ivory. I hid some ivory in the room. Pepin is one of the ivory dogs, and I hid some ivory in the room. You, guys, just stay put. He\'s also not trained on narcotics, so no one has to make a run, (Laughter) for the door or anything like that, and when Meg tells him to go, he\'ll do his thing. So what you\'re going to see is you\'re going to see him work, and you can watch his head, he\'ll move his head up and down, it\'s a little hard indoors because there\'s not much air moving around in here. But he\'ll search, and you may see him whip around, change directions, his alert is something we call ""passive alert."" He sits. And the reason he does that is because we have him trained not to disturb the samples. Sometimes it\'s a crime scene, so they want to collect evidence. Sometimes we collect scats for DNA or things like that. Normally, he works in big open places. He is trained on grizzly bear, he is trained on wolverine, so he runs on big, high meadows and pastures, but he\'s also trained on containers, vehicles and buildings. And he\'s checking there. You see he\'s got scent now. There he goes. Good job, pal! That\'s his alert. And she has a command that is, ""Show me!"" And he\'ll show where it is. So that\'s a broken ivory tusk. (Applause) Well done. Thank you! (Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now the population is over seven billion, which is due to a change in our way of life from over 10,000 years ago. Some of your and my ancestors saw the potential in certain wild plants and animals and started domesticating them. This happened through continuous cultivation and selection of those plants with a special capacity - only a small part of wild plants and animals can be domesticated at all. Let's have a look at this plant, for example. Isn't it amazing that out of this wild cabbage, kale, cauliflower and all the other cabbage varieties were developed? This development into a culture plant did, of course, not happen overnight but took thousands of years, and it took several hundreds of generations of humans. That's why they are a real cultural heritage, just like the Eiffel Tower or a Van Gogh painting. So, maybe the next time you bite into a cauliflower, be aware that you're eating a kind of Mona Lisa. (Laughter) Through domestication process, a huge diversity arose. For almost every part of the world, species and varieties that fit the special conditions were found. In Switzerland, for example, there were distinct varieties in almost every village, like the Küttiger carrot or the Uster apple. I like to watch the reactions of people at exhibitions of traditional varieties. It is clearly split by age. Older the people say, 'Oh, I remember this variety from my grandmother's garden.' And younger people, they are just amazed and say, 'I didn't know there were so many different ones', and then they take out their phone and take a picture. (Laughter) But apart from being a cultural heritage or simply being beautiful, do we really need this much diversity? Would not one single variety of each crop be enough? What happens if a population depends too much on a single variety was highlighted in Ireland in the mid 19th century. The Irish were mostly cultivating a potato variety called the Lumper. Potatoes of the same variety are clones and thus genetically identical. So when a new disease arrived with the potato blight, it had a very easy game, and it destroyed the crops in consecutive years. The sad consequence was that about a million people died, and one and a half million Irish had to emigrate. We can see from this that nature does not agree with monocultures, as they can be easily wiped out by a single disease. The natives in South America, for example, do not grow only one single potato variety but many, many different ones. Like this, they always have a yield, as the varieties differ in their reaction to pests and drier or wetter years. A more current example to show that monocultures are only short living is the banana. It may well be that in a few years, you will not be able to eat one anymore. The trade relies to 95 percent on a single variety which is grown on large plantations. These are now threatened by the Panama disease. There is no other variety to replace it at the moment. And to make my point for diversity very clear, let's look at it from a completely different angle. If you were so lucky to be a millionaire, you would not put all your money on the same stock, but you would diversify because the risk of losing everything is too big. But, in agriculture, instead of diversifying and minimising the risk, what we are doing is the exact opposite. And this funnel represents the concentration which is taking place at every level. Firstly, it represents the people working in agriculture. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was 60 percent of the population. Now, it is down to three percent. And it stands for the seed companies. In 1970, there were 7,000 companies, and none had a market share of over 0.5%. Now, the top five hold 60 percent of the market. And it stands for the huge loss in diversity. In the last 150 years, we lost 75 percent of all varieties ever selected by humans. They have gone forever. One reason for this huge loss is the industrialisation of every culture and with it the appearance of modern hybrid seeds. For farmers and gardeners, hybrid seeds are a dead end because they do not stay true to type when you take the seeds. You have to buy them every year, and thus, they are an extremely good business model, as you have to rely on the companies. Traditional varieties, on the other hand, can be regrown by everybody who wants to, year after year, by saving your own seeds. With traditional varieties, many ways are possible, and this is what makes them powerful. They can be the base for a more sustainable agricultural future. We do not know what challenges lie ahead and what new traits will be necessary, but the more diversity we can safeguard now, the better the chances are that we will have the suitable varieties at hand for the future. And that is why I would like this funnel to be reversed again. With urban gardening and farming and community supported agriculture, reversing this process has already started. And that is why we from the ProSpecieRara Foundation try to save as many different traditional varieties as possible. At the moment we're safeguarding 1,600 different vegetable varieties in our seed library here in Basel, and the number is still growing. We think it's important to sow the seeds every year so that they can adapt to changing environment. We would need a very large garden to be able to do so, but fortunately, we have the help of over 500 volunteers who grow the varieties in their own garden and then send the saved seeds back to us. Without them, our work and that of other seed saving organisations would not be possible. You can also be part in reversing this process. To be honest, seed saving is quite difficult with most crops, but some are rather easy. Tomatoes, for example, are very simple and very rewarding. Have you ever eaten a sun-ripe tomato fresh from the plant? The taste of it excels that of the supermarket type by far. And instead of eating only red and round ones, you can choose from a huge variety in color, shape and size. I'm sure you would find one that suits you. All you need is a sunny spot on your balcony or in front of your house, a pot, earth and water. When a tomato is ripe, the seeds are ripe as well. So if you want to get the seeds from a very good variety, you just put the seeds in a glass and let them sit for one or two days. Then you rinse them and let them dry. As nature is abundant, you will get a large amount of seeds, which you can share with your friends and family and resow next spring. By sowing and sharing them, you will keep a link alive to what your and my ancestors have been doing for thousands of years, and bring it into the future. I hope you will give it a try. Thank you.

In an eye-opening talk, Taylor shows why we have an unprecedented opportunity right now to end violence against children and create a better future for every child.",0:11:03,11.05,24713,2019-09-05T19:49:51+00:00,"['global issues', 'children', 'youth', 'activism', 'social change', 'violence']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Hrvatski', 'Italiano', 'Kiswahili', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Slovenščina', 'Türkçe', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'العربية', 'کوردی', 'हिन्दी', 'ગુજરાતી', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '한국어']",Howard Taylor,Child safety advocate,"{'00:06': '[This talk contains mature content]', '00:10': 'I\'m often asked what do I do. To which I reply, ""I work to end violence against children. All violence against every child in every country."" There\'s usually a pause. Sometimes, depending on the setting, ""Whoa, that\'s a conversation killer."" And then the questions: ""What sort of violence are you talking about?"" ""How much violence is there?"" ""Where is it happening, is it happening here?"" And when I answer those questions, people tend to be shocked. Shocked at the scale of violence, shocked at the nature of violence. But I\'m always quick to make sure that people aren\'t left with a sense of doom and gloom.', '00:51': ""I believe we have an unprecedented historical opportunity in this generation to end violence against children. There's a nascent movement building around this. Governments, national governments, city governments, provinces and others are joining that movement. And when we succeed -- and it will take all of us -- we will change the course of human history."", '01:13': 'What do I mean by violence against children? I mean all of the physical violence, sexual, psychological and emotional violence that happens to children at home, at school, online and in their communities. We work with partners right across the world and from those partners, we hear disturbing stories of individual children.', '01:34': ""For example, Sarah, age 10. Raped repeatedly by her stepfather and threatened with violence if she tells anyone. Faisal, hit across the knuckles at school with a cable, shamed and called a donkey, made to stand outside in the cold when he gets the answers wrong. And from the partners we work with to make the internet safer for children, we hear stories like that of Angelika. Twelve years old, and forced to commit sexual acts on her uncle, which are live-streamed to paying adults the other side of the world. One in 10 girls experiences sexual abuse before the age of 20. Half of children live in countries where corporal punishment has not been fully prohibited. And last year alone, in the US, 45 million reports were made of images and videos of violent and sexual abuse of children online. Twice the number the year before. Now these forms of violence and other forms of violence roll up into some truly staggering numbers. One billion children globally every year who experience some kind of violence. That's one in two children. This is a universal issue."", '02:48': 'So what gives me optimism? Let me talk about Sweden and Uganda. Probably about as different as two countries you might imagine. If you speak to an economist, they might tell you that Sweden has a per capita average income of around 50,000 dollars a year. In Uganda, it\'s 2,000 dollars. A historian might tell you Sweden hasn\'t been in a national conflict for about 200 years. Uganda is still struggling with an insurgency in the north of the country. A musician might tell you that Uganda, the national anthem, ""Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty,"" is one of the shortest in the world. In fact, so short, it\'s often played more than once. I believe Swedes play theirs and sing theirs for a little longer.', '03:30': 'But more seriously, Sweden and Uganda have made a commitment, they have a common bond and shared purpose, a commitment to end violence against children, and they are taking action to try and get their countries on a pathway to zero violence against children by 2030. And many other countries, cities and states are joining them, all over the world.', '03:52': ""But what does it really mean, what does it mean in practice? When they make that commitment, what do they do? It means high-level political commitment and leadership. Enacting and implementing legislation. And launching initiatives, changing policy, starting a national conversation that begins to raise awareness on a journey to changing attitudes and making it socially unacceptable to have any violence and abuse of children in a country. It means recognizing that violence against children cuts across many sectors, and therefore the response, the answer, has to be a systems approach. You can't just do one piece of it. It requires multiple agencies within and beyond government. It requires faith groups, the private sector, media, academia, civil society organizations and others. And it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us, but using national-level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country. And using that data to inform the national response, but also using it to measure and track progress. And share what's working, being honest about when things aren't working. And sharing inspiration when we see success and violence declining."", '05:04': ""But can we really do this on a global scale? One billion children a year experiencing violence. I think we can. In 2015, 193 world leaders committed their countries to end violence, abuse and neglect of children by 2030. Violence against children undermines all the other investments in them: in their health, in their education. Often with multi-year, sometimes lifelong and intergenerational consequences and transmission. But it's not just about international agreements and governments. They really matter. I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated. Think of the #MeToo movement, and how sector after sector, industry after industry, calling out perpetrators, bringing and holding them to account. It's a journey, but we've embarked upon it. Look at what's happened in the aid industry. Following some abuses of power, the aid industry is now taking very seriously the safeguarding of children across the world."", '06:08': ""But maybe even more than that. Children and young people themselves, part aided by technology, but they have a voice now that they may not, I don't think, have had before. And they are using that voice, not just to advocate for the situation they see around them or what they know needs to improve, but to be part of the solutions of things that actually inform and affect their lives. Think of those young activists who speak out against female genital mutilation, child marriage, cyber bullying, safe schools, harming conflict -- the list goes on and on. Those children really matter."", '06:46': ""So we have political leadership, we have youth activism, we have evidence-based solutions, we have public awareness growing -- we're on that pathway, beginning that journey to get to zero by 2030. But what are those solutions?"", '07:02': ""Three years ago, in 2016, 10 global institutions came together and aligned behind a framework which is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to ending violence against children. It's called INSPIRE. It looks at the need for the relevant legislation, addressing social norms, parent and caregiver support, responses for children who have experienced violence and abuse. And safe schools, so children can be in a learning environment where they thrive."", '07:31': ""In Uganda, four years ago, an eight-year-old girl could be married to a 30-year-old man. That can no longer happen. In 2016, the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18. That's the I of INSPIRE: enact and implement legislation."", '07:49': ""Cambodia is rolling out parental support, parent and caregiver support across the country, so parents are equipped to raise their children and to have discipline in a nonviolent way in the home. That's the P of INSPIRE, parent and caregiver support."", '08:04': ""In the Philippines, there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide. Women and children who are either at high risk of abuse and violence or have experienced violence. That's the R of INSPIRE, response and support services."", '08:18': ""And in Uganda, a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda, equipping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline. That's the E of INSPIRE, education and life skills."", '08:33': ""That's just some bits within some of the INSPIRE framework. But more and more countries are committing to implement it, adapt it locally, inform it with the relevant data, put a plan together, work across sectors, and begin that journey to zero. Canada, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania -- I mentioned Sweden and Uganda already -- Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, more and more countries, and now cities, too. And right here in Scotland, University of Edinburgh is establishing a learning lab that's going to track the journey that cities in Scotland and the Philippines and Colombia go on together. See what works in a city, take something that's being prepared for implementation at a nationwide level and bring it down to the city level, where we believe that we can actually make probably faster and demonstrable progress in a shorter space of time. And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University."", '09:32': ""Ending violence is the right thing to do, it's a smart investment to make, we have evidence-based solutions, and we have the beginnings of a journey."", '09:41': ""But what would happen if we actually end violence against children? Let's just imagine for a moment. First of all, think of the children I mentioned. Sarah would no longer lie in her bed at night, fearful of the sound of her stepfather's footsteps coming up the stairs. Faisal would go to school and he would thrive. He would no longer fear being at school and being bullied and hit and ashamed by the teachers. And Angelika and those like her would no longer be something, a commodity brought online for the enjoyment of adults thousands of miles away."", '10:17': ""But then multiply the social, the economic, the cultural benefits of that. Multiply those by every family, every community, village, town, city, country and suddenly, you've got a new normal emerging. A generation would grow up without having experienced violence."", '10:35': 'It will take us all. But we do have an unprecedented opportunity to try, and I believe we also, as adults, have a responsibility to do this.', '10:45': 'And then when we\'re all asked, ""What do you do?"" each and every one of us can say, ""I\'m changing the course of human history. I\'m doing my bit to end violence against children."" Let\'s do this and do it now.', '11:01': 'Thank you.', '11:02': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They steal our jobs. Overweight people are lazy and undisciplined. Homosexuals are perverts, and they are a bad influence for our children. How uncomfortable, no? I'm discriminating out loud. And it's uncomfortable. But this uncomfortable feeling is a seed. A seed that demonstrates a social agreement among us that recognizes that discrimination causes harm. Poor people are poor because they don't want to work. Jews are dirty. And they steal. How much harm is caused by discrimination? As a family, we found out. By surprise, and decades after the fact, but we found out. My grandparents were Hungarian, and they emigrated to the USA before the Second World War. Meanwhile, their siblings arrived to Córdoba, Argentina, from Hungary before and after the Second World War. When questions arose about our family history, the only person left who could answer these questions was my grandfather's brother who lived here in Córdoba. I came here in 1994 to speak with him. Today, we are going to call him János. From János we learned that we were Jewish. My grandfather hid it in the USA to protect us. János, here in Córdoba, did the same. His children and grandchildren grew up unaware of their heritage. Why? Because János learned in the most definitive way how much harm discrimination can cause. In World War Two, János' son, an infant, was murdered because he was Jewish. In his wife's arms. János' sister was also murdered, with her two children. Boys aged three and seven. Along with his brother-in-law, his father- in-law, his other niece, and neighbors. Every one of them transformed into smoke in concentration camps. We had no idea. As a species, how is it possible that we are capable of such atrocities? How is it possible that they continue to happen even today? Is there anything that I, or we, can do to revert this? These are questions I visit every day. And with these questions, I always recall a memory my great-uncle shared with me -- one of the many gifts he bestowed me: In the spring of 1944, the last year of the war, they began to march the Jews from the ghetto where they were enclosed to the train station. They did not know where they were going. Despite the rumors, they could not imagine what destiny awaited them. When they crossed the familiar city center, they saw a ghost town. No one dared to come outside. If you were a Jewish sympathizer, your life was at risk. Either you discriminated, or you died. My family members were among the last group marching out of the ghetto that spring. Despite the silent streets, someone walked with them. Despite the risk to his life, he walked with them. An older man, a Christian, a neighbor who had been a friend of our family. He could not raise his voice. He could not save the lives of his friends who were different. But he could be a witness. This was his seed; and he planted it where he was, in the moment in history that was his to live. It is the same seed that makes us uncomfortable even today when we hear or see discrimination. How much harm is caused by discrimination? In the camps, side by side with the Jews, the homosexuals, the Gypsies, the disabled, communists, any kind of sympathizer—all were murdered. All of them transformed into smoke. Today, 73 years later, the seed our neighbor planted lives on. And it shows us how much we have evolved. But it also demonstrates that we continue to harm others, as individuals, and as a society. The Muslims are terrorists. People from the USA are brutes, and racist. Is that so? What do we achieve by perpetuating the jokes? By not looking at ourselves? More questions I visit each day. If my great-uncle could not go to the grave with our family's history, neither could I. So I wrote a book to honor all that he returned to us as a family, to honor our magical time together. And also to illustrate these ceaseless questions of mine. I was convinced that I created the book for personal reasons. Some teachers in Córdoba taught me otherwise. As soon as the book came to life, they wrote me to share that they were using the book in their classrooms. The book has a very unusual format-- it's all color, a vibrant mix of testimonies, photos, maps, art. And it's full of mystery. Right away these teachers saw something in the book that I-- despite having been immersed in this project for more than 20 years-- never saw: unique educational material that is potent and versatile for teaching a wide variety of subjects in the classroom: discrimination, identity, history, immigration, visual arts, ethics. And they could explore these topics simultaneously in different classes. I readily confess that I do not have the courage to be a school teacher. But I do have the courage to listen to them. Because for me, there is no force more potent for generating positive change in society than an inspired teacher. And I began to wonder. If just a couple teachers with a single copy of the book were so motivated by what happened in their classrooms that they wrote me to share the news, without knowing who I was, what would happen if a lot of teachers had several copies of the book? There, I found the “why” of absolutely everything that happened to us as a family and to my great-uncle and me along the way. I found our seed. It is this. How about a suitcase? That is a traveling library, that travels by bus. Free of charge for its users. With this excitement, I reached out to people I knew, and I reached out to total strangers, to help me create the traveling library. Through what are now various suitcases, we equip teachers with several copies of the book, a study guide, and a registry where each school shares its experience with the traveling library. The seed grows and grows. Each year via crowdfunding campaigns, individual sponsors from more than five countries and from all of Argentina extend their hands so that the traveling libraries —the suitcases— continue to travel to schools, museums and libraries throughout all of Argentina. They travel non-stop, and they travel without cost. Each place has the traveling library for one month. The first year, we had just one suitcase. The second year, two suitcases, then three. Now there are four. Since they began traveling in July, 2013, they have been in the hands and minds of over 6,000 people. They have visited over 150 schools. The suitcases come and go, they arrive and they take off. I'm the crazy lady at the bus station in Carlos Paz. I pick them up and send them off again. Suitcases, sponsors, students, teachers, books, buses. Time and again in the registries that accompany the traveling libraries, and in the messages from the teachers, one can read and perceive that in the encounter, there is transformation. There is empathy. I was 20 when I met my great-uncle, and I was innocent and unaware enough so as to admit to him that I didn't have much hope that the human condition was going to improve. How he yelled at me. He was not very tall. And his light blue eyes were scary. “What? How can you not be hopeful? I have seen the end of the world,” he yelled. “And it was not the end of the world. I breathed every moment of the end, and it was not the end; so then how can you, at your age, not be hopeful? You silly little girl!” Truly, a very silly little girl. Everyone János held dear, everyone close to him was murdered. Everyone. Despite that, he died in peace here in Córdoba, at 93. Not without pain, but in peace. So then how can we not follow his example? How can we not believe that it is possible to illuminate the moment in history in which we live? With encounters, with our gaze, with dialog, with ideas, with art, with music, in any way possible, wherever possible. Planting seeds.

Anybody in the audience who doesn\'t have a plastic ID? Anybody? Well, think about it. Plastic is everywhere. The buttons on your shirt, your mobile cover, the water from the plastic bottle you just had, plastic money in the wallet, maybe. It is interesting how plastic has become an integral part of our lives and how we cannot go one single day without it. Do you know what that makes me think? How my generation is inheriting not just this legacy but also the problem that comes with it: the problem of what we throw in our oceans. Hello, everybody. My name is Haaziq Kazi. I am 12 years old, and I alone have a plastic debt of roughly 66 tons and counting. So, in case you are wondering, What is plastic debt? It is the amount of non-cycled plastic which we humans leave behind on this planet. How many Indians in the house today? Raise your hands, please. According to a study, for every person in India, six tons of plastic is not recycled annually. Any Americans here? Your figures are even more astounding. Ninety tons per person of plastic which is not recycled, annually. Imagine, in a lifetime, how much plastic is left behind because of us. When we die, our bodies go back to Mother Earth, but the plastic debt is left behind as a legacy for the coming generations. Did you know that by 2050, we will have as much, or maybe more, plastic in the ocean than fish? Speaking of which, every time I see people eating fish, I wonder, ""Are they eating fish or plastic?"" Because the plastic we dispose that ends up in the ocean might have been consumed by the same fish which gets on our plate - talk about the vicious karmic cycle. The magnitude of the problem inspired me to do something about this. Hence, I came up with an idea of an invention that could help make the oceans a cleaner place: an ocean cleaner called ERVIS. ERVIS is an intelligent ship which sucks waste from the ocean surface and cleans it. It all started two years back. I saw some documentaries and a TED Talk of Boyan Slat about how he wanted to clean the oceans. A few days later, as I came home from playing football, my mom asked me to wash my hands, and as I went to the sink to get the dirt off, I observed a whirlpool of water going down the drain. An idea came to my mind, and I smiled. I drew and created a rough model, a circular ship with saucers attached, a very futuristic design, much like the USS Enterprise from Star Trek. Come on, we all love the series. Right? This was just the first draft. The propellers weren\'t automated, and it only lasted seven seconds in water before coming apart. But there it was: my ERVIS, my vision of changing the oceans. While guzzling down innumerable cups of hot chocolate - you know, I\'m still a kid, no coffee for me - I did some exhaustive research to achieve my vision of ERVIS, which is: first, to clean the current waste floating in the ocean; second, to analyze the data from the waste which we collect; and third, to stop it at source, which is getting disposed by the ships. I also realized that a circular shape was not very efficient and that I had to redesign my ship to be more hydrodynamic. So I worked with scientists and engineers to create a more bleeding edge model. So here\'s how it works. The ship is essentially a large boat powered by solar and renewable natural gas, with various compartments, and saucers surrounding it. The saucers float on the surface, gravitate to create a whirlpool to pull the waste towards its center, which is then sent through a tube to various chambers in the ship. The chambers include an oil chamber, which collects waste oil. The next four chambers are for large, medium, small, and micro-waste, respectively. Just imagine ERVIS to be a gigantic vacuum cleaner with many cleaning tubes attached to many dust bags. Once the waste enters the chambers, ERVIS analyzes, segregates, and compacts it, and pumps the filtered water back into the oceans, all without harming marine life in the process. ERVIS, the ship, is my contribution in making the Earth a better place. (Applause) And I hope, in some way, it can inspire you to find your idea which can bring a positive change in the world. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's from that period, circa 1735, that we find these bone buttons. These were made by poor persons in the almshouse. Poor persons in the almshouse were assigned various tasks to earn their keep, among them, shredding old rope for reuse, dressing hemp, picking oakum, making bone buttons, in the thought that hard work would reform these poor persons into productive members of society. The almshouse served several groups: poor needy persons, sturdy beggars, idle wandering vagabonds. And reasons to be admitted? Insanity, pregnancy, or being a widow or an orphan who could no longer pay their way.  Which makes this piece all the more interesting. This child's plate was found within the walls of the Bridewell. The Bridewell was one of the most feared and notorious prisons of its time, and it happened to have been right next door to the almshouse. In fact, there were prisons on either side of the almshouse, and at times, these institutions were so overcrowded. Prisoners and poor persons were sharing the same spaces. And while there is a lot of clamor about how can you expose children to hardened criminals, let's not forget that children as young as twelve were convicted to the Bridewell for stealing bread. What all this gives us is an insight into life in the 18th century, what it was like to be poor in the 18th century, perhaps being segregated from a portion of society, perhaps being assigned tasks to earn their keep. It was a time when three-fifths of New York City's population were living at or near the subsistence level, if not below. And 10% of the population owned more than half of the city's wealth. The past has a lot to teach us about our present and our future. I'm a firm believer that in order to have a sustainable future, we must have a well-understood past. Archaeology affords us New Yorkers and pretty much anyone in an urban center the opportunity to incorporate the knowledge of our past into our present-day dialogues, into the dialogues about our futures, incorporate the information into our shared spaces, and hopefully, it can bring all of our diverse communities within New York City, again, within any city closer together. And if I can get just one person to think a little bit differently about what they see when they walk down the city streets, or through an urban park, then I've done my job of sharing the past.

In this talk, Barnes describes how biomolecular archaeology is transforming the way we think about racial migration in prehistoric times.",,,23000,2018-07-19T15:52:16+00:00,"['Science (hard)', 'archaeology', 'history', 'biology', 'race']","['English', 'Español', 'Português de Portugal']",Professor Ian Barnes,Research leader and ancient DNA specialist,"{'0:00': 'Hello everyone. So, I\'m going to talk today about migration and movement, and particularly people moving into the British Isles in the past. And if we think about past migrations into Britain, we probably first off might have some ideas about the 20th century, people coming from the Caribbean, from east Africa, or from India, or Pakistan, or places like that. And if we have to go back a bit further in time, of course we\'ve got people like the Normans, Romans or the Vikings. But despite the fact that we\'ve noticed quite a lot of people who have moved into Britain at different times, I don\'t think we really think of ourselves as a migrant nation. We think of ourselves more outside as an island nation. But what about if we go back really a long way, we really go back far in time beyond the time when there is any notion of a Britain or an England, beyond any kind of english language, in fact beyond written history at all. In fact, we can go so far back in time that Britain is actually not even an island at all. It\'s still joined to the continent, still part of the Eurasian landmass. So that\'s what I want to talk to you about today, about Britain in prehistory, and the prehistory of migration here. So we\'re going to take a big jump back in time, but I can\'t do that with you all in one go. So we are going to take little jumps first. We are going to jump back to the late Victorian period, and we\'re going to start off here. Here, we start in Somerset at Cheddar Gorge. It is here during the last decades of the 19th century, that this guy, Richard Cox Gough, discovered and excavated and blasted out a series of caves that he made into a major tourist attraction or a showcase. But it\'s actually a year after Richard died that the really big discovery was made, the one we\'re actually interested in. So that discovery was made in December, 1903, and it was made by Richard\'s son, Arthur, who was digging a drainage ditch to try to combat the seasonal flooding that they had in the caves. They tended to make all their big discoveries in the winter because that\'s when there weren\'t any tourists around. So workmen who were working on the cave actually blasted out and uncovered  the skeleton of an adult male. And rather quickly, this skeleton made big news. Experts of the day said that perhaps it was the body of the first Englishman, and that he was of extreme importance, that he was at least 40,000 years old and perhaps as much as 80,000 years old. Well, that\'s not entirely true. What we actually know today is that ""Cheddar Man,"" as he became known, Is actually about 10,000 years old, but he is still certainly very important. He\'s extremely important for a number of reasons. Firstly because he is the only near-complete skeleton that we have from that kind of time period. He is also important because he\'s the only one where we have a complete skull or near-complete skull. And here is the skull, in this rather post-setting with the two brothers, William and Arthur, staring at it. They seem to be enjoying themselves which is what I really like about this picture. (Laughter) So what else do we know about Cheddar Man? Well, he\'s definitely a man. And that has been the subject of a little bit debate over the years because he has a rather gracile and slender skeleton. He was probably in his early twenties when he died; he was buried deliberately, it seems, and he was buried on his own. Today, he looks something like this. This guy has been better assembled, and you can see him at the Natural History Museum. He is on display a couple of galleries away from where my office is. So, we\'ve worked on Cheddar Man and a number of other individuals over the years and built together quite a large complex project exploring the history of the British Isles. And one of the things that came up as the result of that project was the opportunity to take part in a channel 4 documentary where we were going to explore Cheddar Man and his history to build up more of a story about him. So that was good because we already had quite a lengthy project working on the history of the British Isles, but what the people who put the documentary together wanted to know about was something a little bit more complicated, more detailed, and that was about his appearance, about his skin color, hair color and eye color. And what we were able to do for them was to supply that information. We passed it on to the people who made the reconstruction. Well, they came back with this, an individual with a rather small face compared to the overall size of his head, with blue eyes, dark curly hair,  and obviously with dark skin. And that was a surprise for some people, for most of the people I talked to actually. And most of them actually seem to think that this was rather cool. People who saw the show generally quite enjoyed it. We weren\'t particularly surprised by this because similar information had already been generated by a group, a couple of year previously, looking at different skeletons around Europe of a similar kind of age. They had already identified that dark skin was practically normal for people about 10,000 years ago. But what we\'ve been able to do  was better quantify exactly how dark that was. And we\'ve done that using a tool borrowed from forensic sciences. Some people didn\'t think that this was very cool. Some people I think were expecting to see something a little bit more like this, which is the results of the previous reconstruction. Both reconstructions are obviously quite different, but they do share one feature at least which is this rather wispy facial hair. And I\'m surprised about that because there\'s really no evidences either way, from the archeological genetic data, that would tend to actually suggest that. But that is perhaps their only shared feature actually. So those people, who didn\'t think it was very cool, were a bit surprised, and they made their surprise known on social media, as you might expect. And actually things got rather heated there, and you can look at that. Right now I don\'t really want to go into too much detail about it. But here\'s one of the sort of slightly odd events that happened there, one of my childhood heroes indirectly ... (Laughter) ... indirectly congratulating me on having upset some people. So that was a little bit weird actually. And that went on for a while. So, what became clear to us was something rather disappointing. As I\'ve already said to you, we had spent quite a bit of time getting a pretty good understanding of what the population history of British Isles actually looks like. So how do you get from someone like this to people in the audience today? I mean Cheddar Man obviously not Billy Bragg! So that\'s what I\'m going to go through now, what we\'re going to have a look at. Okay, but before we can do that we have to work out how exactly we\'re going to look at that information. We really have a lot of data here. The human genome has 3.2 billion base pairs and I can\'t just keep flashing that up because we\'d run out of time quite quickly. So what we need to do is find a way of crunching those data down and just pulling out the most important and interesting parts of it. And the method that we often use just to get a handle on the data initially is called the ""principal components analysis,"" and that\'s what I\'m going to show you here. So these are genome data that has been squashed down onto something that looks a bit like a graph or a plot. And so individuals who are close together are genetically similar to each other, regardless of where they might happen to come from. So let\'s start here with Cheddar Man. But all alone, like he was in Gough\'s cave, he\'s not actually doing much for us, he\'s not telling us very much. So let\'s put on the other five individuals from Britain, from which we have very small amounts of genome sequenced data, and see what happens. What happens then is that they all plot together quite neatly. Despite the fact that we have individuals here from Scotland, Wales and southwest England, they actually all look quite similar to each other. Let\'s expand the search a bit more across the rest of Europe. What we have here are some more individuals. The ones in blue are older individuals, slightly older ones from slightly earlier time periods. The ones in that kind of dark red color are of a similar age. And these are samples that have been taken from Spain, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg, all sorts of places including Britain. And what you see is that the British ones  kind of bridge the gap between the earlier and later ones. But there\'s still not much of a picture here. Where we do get a bit of a surprise is if we jump forward in time a bit more. Okay, so what we have here,  about 4000 years after Cheddar Man died, is that something quite surprising happened in Britain, and that\'s the origins of farming. So the first farmers had arrived in Europe several thousands years earlier. They had arrived in Greece. They are the red folks on that plot. They\'d made they way across Europe over several millennia and eventually arrived in Britain where we have the grey individuals on the plot. What you can see there about those grey people is that we have two important things to get out of this. They are genetically extremely different to the hunter-gatherers that were in Britain at that time. And they entirely replaced them, a complete replacement of the population. Now it\'s always tempting at these points to think of some kind of vast horde arriving and committing some kind of genocidal act on the people, the peaceful hunter-gatherer people. We don\'t have any evidence for that at all. So what we think in fact is quite plausible is that there were actually remarkably few people in the British Isles at this time. [Farmers] arrive and just take over. And they can easily take over the country. What is even more surprising  is that a very similar thing happens about 1300 years later. A second genetically very distinct group arrives in the British Isles. These are the so-called ""Beaker people"" who are called that because of the distinctive ceramic vessels that they\'re often buried with. These Beaker people were also genetically very different and seem to completely replace the Neolithic people there, the farmers that were there before. And this, it seems, is the last major population replacement that we can detect at the resolution that we can work with at the moment, with ancient DNA data. So if we bring up now the modern population across Europe, you can see that those Beaker people sit pretty much on top of current British Isles populations and, in fact, the populations of northwestern Europe continents in a bit of smear across there as well. Okay, so what can we draw from this? What do we really have to conclude here? One of the things that I realized  some time after we\'ve done this work and the documentary show was that for some people who are upset by the way we had reconstructed Cheddar Man, the issue was one of population continuity. We had challenged that notion that they had that there was a long-term population continuity in Britain. And that\'s very much not what the data seem to be saying. The history and the prehistory of Britain is one where populations are under a series of replacements. The other thing that you can also draw from this data is about migration and our modern day concerns about mass migration and how it affects society. What you can see here is that the scale of migration today, despite the advent of globalization and mass transportation, is nothing like the kind of migrations that we must have had in the past that have led to these very large-scale replacements. Thanks very much.

(Applause) And news consumers, if you want the facts, subscribe. (Applause) Read newspapers and perhaps ask, Why would journalism that's any good be free? (Applause) Why do any one of us routinely put up with baseless opinion, speculation and propaganda? And why do we waste so much time on the Kardashians? (Laughter) (Cheers) (Applause) Too much sugar just makes you fat. (Laughter) Journalists, keep going and stay humble. We may know a little about a lot, but few of us know enough about anything to have an opinion that matters. So we dig for the facts that do matter, from all sides, and then fight like hell to tell them. And potential future journalists, your country needs you. Journalism is war, a fight every day for truth. And it takes more than being curious and knowing how to write or blog or shoot a video or ask questions. It takes courage, and most of all, it takes integrity. Because journalism is only as good as the people who practice it and their willingness to stand up and fight for the stories that mean something. You will make mistakes; we all do. But with practice and instincts you may not know you have, you will learn to make less of them. You will face a lack of resources, you will be denied access, people will refuse to give you interviews, editors and executive producers will give you impossible deadlines and not enough time or space to tell your stories. This is emotionally hard and sometimes around-the-clock work. It might cause people to hate you. It might put you in danger or expose you to trauma that might give you PTSD. This I know from experience. But after nearly 40 years at this, I still stand here before you and can honestly say with all my heart: journalism is a noble calling, a way to serve people and respond like an EMT or an emergency room doctor in a crisis with information they may need. If you work for the people and not for those who pay your checks, you will make the right choices about who to interview, what to ask and how to tell your stories, and this will bring your news organizations value that will make even your bosses happy. Be incorruptible. Do it with a pure motive, earnestly, without bias and expectations. Do it even though you may never know the impact of your stories. Do it even if you know you will be criticized. But get it right, which you will find is far more important than getting it first. Attribute, (Applause) attribute whenever possible. Check, check, and then double check the facts. Ruthlessly edit out any word or phrase or tone in your work that could get in the way of people making up their own minds. This is how we build trust, by working to be worthy of it. It is time to lift truth off its knees, prize it, cherish it, defend it and watch it rise along with all of us. Thank you.

On the horizon, a shimmering vision under the blazing sun. This is not a cloud, or anything you've ever seen before. It's an enormous ship followed by dozens and dozens more. Strange men come towards you in their white robes carrying with them knowledge and treasures from a distant land. This unimaginable assemblage was led by Admiral Zheng He who established the first-ever sea route connecting the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. The influence of this voyage was so profound that it changed the local cultures wherever it landed. With navigation skills, shipbuilding techniques, Chinese etiquette and social practices on display. Even today, the impact of Admiral Zheng's armada can be traced from Africa all the way back to Asia. I'm here to tell you that another invasion is happening 600 years later and this one will impact you. This one is also led by Chinese, but this time, it's Chinese millennials. (Laughter) I know a ton has been written and said about American millennials - it's all you guys talk about! You're trying to study them, label them, define them, and most importantly, you're trying to cater to them. (Laughter) I'd like to suggest that you might be looking at the wrong group of millennials on the wrong continent. Because whether you're ready or not, we Chinese millennials are about to take over the world! (Laughter) But luckily, I'm here to help you. (Laughter) Here are five things you must know for surviving the impending Chinese millennial invasion. (Laughter) Number one: We are many! (Laughter) Do you know how many American millennials you have today? 90 million. That's a lot. Now, imagine that times five. That's how many of us there are. With a population of around 400 million, we Chinese millennials are proud to be the third biggest country in the world. Most of the talk about American millennials is related to the workplace. With almost five times the amount of American millennials, Chinese millennials are an enormous labor pool. And we're being completely overlooked in the U.S. Who would you rather hire? A new employee who is the best out of 100 people? Or a new employee who is the best out of 500? And since there are so many of us, you'll be seeing more of us in places you never thought of. Don't believe me? This guy seems pretty popular here. (Laughter) He might look old; he's actually one of us millennials. 20 years ago, who would have imagined that a seven foot-plus tall Chinese athlete would become the only non-American player to lead the NBA in all-star voting. Number two: We're well educated and super motivated. Because of the high population density and limited resources, labor is easily replaceable in China. We are required to work harder and be more motivated just to compete with our peers. We're surely not all of the labor pool in China. I contacted Dx Consulting. Today, 57 percent of Chinese millennials have a bachelor's degree; 23 percent of us have a master's degree; and 20 percent have an associate's degree. And of course, we're not just educated in China. In the U.S. in 2014 and '15, 42 percent of Chinese students were studying STEM - science, technology, engineering, mathematics - versus 12 percent for American students. 27 percent of us were studying business and management versus 16 for all students studying in the U.S. We are choosing majors that can give us a competitive edge, and in turn, higher exposure and impact in Western society. Are you having a hard time motivating your American millennial employees? (Laughter) Well, Chinese millennials don't need you to spend a dime on a Foosball table or an in-house coffee shop. (Laughter) (Applause) We are already super motivated and qualified. (Laughter) And we're more than happy to take on the tough jobs. In fact, we've been preparing for it. Number three: We are the Bruce Lee in Levi's with a smartphone who shop online every day. Chinese millennials are multicultural. I even used chopsticks to eat Georgian barbecue when I was interning here in Atlanta. And I was more devastated at this guy's death than my best scores on my Chinese exam. We are really digital. In 2017, smartphone penetration rates is almost 100 percent for those of us who are ages 18 to 34. We are also shaping mobile payment as well as the economy. According to a 2017 survey from Labbrand, 86 percent of Chinese millennials use mobile payment in physical shops at least once a week, versus 45 percent for American millennials. And according to Dx Consulting, we spend four times what American millennials spend for mobile purchases. The U.S. is the center of the digital universe. But for how much longer? If you want to buy the best digital real estate in the virtual world of the future, I suggest that China is a prime location. The good news for foreign companies hoping to capture part of the Chinese millennial market is that my cohort is extremely mobile and adventurous. Here's my personal travel map for the last couple of years. The desire to see the world dominates our consumption habits. We aren't just spending money at home, we are also making purchases and using web services from foreign companies like Airbnb and Uber when we travel overseas. Sure, you buy things from us, and we buy things from you. (Laughter) So next time you have a meeting on how to exploit millennial markets, keep in mind that Chinese millennials - not American - are the biggest emerging consumer demographic on the planet. Number four: We're big picture people. Do you know how big China is? It's around the same size as the States. But we all know that there are four time zones across the contiguous United States. In China, we've got one. In China, everything is perceived as one. One time zone, one official language, one party, despite diverse ethnicities and cultures. Our thinking always starts from the overview to the specific. The Chinese way of writing an address is country, city, and street. And we write the date: year, month, and day. And because we are such big picture people, we focus much more on growth and the future than Americans in the workplace. We tend to look at a company as a whole and see how we fit into it. And number five: We're still Confucian individualists. Granted, we Chinese millennials are acting more and more individual nowadays, but ten years of iPhone and online dating apps cannot wipe out thousands of years of Confucian cultures. A sense of hierarchy is still deeply entrenched in our understanding and construction of social relations. In my mind, a child is supposed to show respect to his parents just like if I'm a subordinate. I'm expected to show respect to a senior manager. I don't think we should disagree with our bosses or criticize them, at least not directly or publicly. (Laughter) (Laughter) My American friends are more likely to challenge authority and power, and I think that's a good thing. We might learn a little bit from American millennials on that, but I do like our respect for hierarchy and experience, and I don't want to see that go away. In 20 years, we'll all still be millennials, but we'll be 40, we'll be in bigger positions of power, and we'll have much more opportunity to change the world like we insist we know how to do right now. And I really hope we do. Everybody knows the Great Wall of China. Even those ancient walls were crossed by Admiral Zheng He 600 years ago, and our new border, if we even had one, is far beyond the old one. Whether you're trying to build your own walls, keep out what you don't want, keep in what you do, hold in your pride, keep out competition, all those things are going to happen anyway. The world is flat. It's flat! But it's tilted toward China now. (Laughter) And I can assure you, we Chinese millennials are ready to be the explorers in this new adventure from the Far East. Thank you.

In this forward-thinking talk, James Orsulak argues that the fix is to move manufacturing operations off-planet, using automated labor to mine resources and perform all those ecosystem-destabilizing processes in the void of space. ""If we do this, we reverse the human supply chain,"" he says. ""Imagine if you walked outside one day and there were no factories, power plants, refineries or oil rigs. We've now zoned the earth for residential access only.""",,,20823,2018-01-03T19:56:33+00:00,"['technology', 'space', 'manufacturing', 'environment', 'sustainability']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', '한국어']",James Orsulak,Space Entrepreneur,"{'0:00': 'All of the resources that we have ever used as a civilization have come from the same place. Everything. All the energy, the fuels, minerals, metals, construction materials. The water, the air that you\'re breathing right now. Every resource that we\'ve ever used has come from the same place: Earth. Now, this actually presents a severe problem, because when we study biological history, we very quickly see that any time there\'s a dominant species in a finite ecosystem, consuming a limited amount of resources, that species will collapse. Now, that collapse usually begins at 50%. When a species has converted 50% of its environment, the ecosystem becomes unstable, and it changes. It’s no longer suitable for that particular species. Now, here’s the scary part. There are 7 billion people on this planet. We are the dominant species. And we’ve converted 43% of the available land mass on Earth. By the year 2050, there will be 9 billion people on our planet and we will be well past 50%. That means most of the people sitting in this auditorium will see this begin. We don’t know exactly what it\'s going to look like, we don\'t know exactly what the impact is going to be, but the worst case scenario is the end of the human race. Because Earth is no longer suitable for human life. Now, the reason that this problem exists is because it’s in our nature. Human beings consume resources. They alter their environment so they can reproduce. It’s the very definition of biological life. The problem is we’re running out of room, we\'re running out of resources and now we\'re running out of time. So we need a plan. What if - what if there was a way that we could make our ecosystem bigger? If we expand our view and we look out into space, we see that all the resources we hold of value here at home - energy, fuels, metals, water - are available in nearly infinite quantities in our solar system. What if there’s a way we could use those resources to prevent the collapse of our civilization? Now, I know, that sounds impossible. It sounds like science fiction. But I have a different viewpoint than you do. I work with some of the smartest people in the world: engineers who have consistently landed robots on other planets; a lot of scientists, rocket scientists, data scientists, planetary scientists, artificial intelligence experts. I’m the head of strategic partnerships for the largest asteroid-mining company in the world. And I believe we can use the resources of space to save our planet. We have proven again and again that we know how to destroy an environment. Now it’s time for us to prove that we can save it. From my vantage point, I see that there\'s more computing power in your car’s key fob than we use to send the astronauts to the Moon. That means we can do incredible things in space with cheap, affordable robots. For the very first time in history we’ve amassed the technological toolkit that we need to dispatch autonomous robotic explorers out into the solar system to find and access these resources and put them to work. Imagine a future where the resources we need do not only come from this planet, a future where we have access to the vast resources of space and we are using them to improve life here on Earth. That’s the future I’m going to show you. It all starts with water. See, today if you want water in space you have to take that resource, you have to load it onto a rocket and launch it into space. Now, that’s a shame because there’s a lot of water in space. There’s water on asteroids, on comets, on the poles of our Moon, and on other planets. Water is everywhere in space. And that’s a good thing because water is one of the most critical resources we will need. You see, this plan involves a lot of robots, but it also involves a lot of people. People will be living and working in space to make this possible. And those people need water for sustenance, for hygiene, for growing food. But water in space is also fuel. If we pass water through an electrical field, we can produce liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. That’s high-efficiency rocket propellant. So if the source water from space and turn it into rocket propellant, we can set up fuel depots in the solar system, gas stations! And when we do that, for the first time we have access to this new resource base because we’re not trying to launch all our fuel from Earth. And now that we have access, we can turn our sights to the next step: construction. You see, asteroids are also made of pure, high-quality metals: nickel, iron, cobalt, platinum. This is the first object that was created from an asteroid. It was the 3D-printed from a meteorite. It’s very heavy, it’s very strong, you’d never want to launch something like this into space from Earth. But if you source metals from space and feed them to orbital construction robots - which by the way, that\'s already a thing, we already have that - then you can create structures that are no longer limited by size. See, this is the International Space Station. It is the most expensive object humans have ever built. It cost a hundred billion dollars. Why was it so expensive? Well, it was created using the resources of Earth, that were turned into products, loaded onto rockets, launched into space and then assembled by humans. But that’s backwards. It doesn’t make sense anymore. That’s like roughly the equivalent of you living in Europe and saying, ""I’m going to move to the United States and build a house there, but I’m going to ship all the materials to build that house across the ocean; all of the wood, the metal, the plumbing, the electrical, the shower heads, I\'m going to ship it across the ocean,\'\' when all of the resources you need are already there at your destination. It doesn\'t make sense. We can reduce the cost and logistical inefficiencies of building large livable structures in space by a factor of a hundred by simply sourcing what we need from our destination. So we can build things in space! What should we build? Well, energy is the single largest driver of resource consumption in the world. We mine for coal. We drill for oil and natural gas. We mine for metals to build our wind plants. We mine for silicon to make our solar panels. We mine for nickel to make batteries so we can store it. One thing remains the same. As the population grows, so does the energy demand, so does the resource consumption that goes with it. We\'ve always assumed that our energy production must happen here on Earth because there\'s never been an alternative, because we haven\'t built one. If we use the resources of space, we can create massive, kilometer-scale solar farms in space. These huge facilities will capture the energy of the sun, that shines in space 24 hours a day, and beam that energy back to Earth. The technology to do this exists today, but it\'s simply too expensive when we try to use the resources of Earth. But if we use the resources in space, we can create planetary-scale macrogrids. You\'ve heard of the electricity grid, maybe you\'ve heard of the microgrid. This is the opposite. This is a planetary-scale, power-generation system. It\'s the energy that we need and the energy is in space. It\'s not the resources buried under our feet. So we have water, fuel, construction capabilities, now power, we have all of the utilities we need to build cities in space. Orbital megastructures spun up to produce artificial gravity so they\'re livable for large populations. These are emerging today as commercial space stations. They\'re research labs for sovereign astronauts from around the world; hotels for adventurous tourists, certainly. But the primary function of these facilities will be manufacturing. We will build things in space. It starts with satellites and spacecraft. Why would we want to build satellites in space? Today when we build a satellite, it\'s constrained by the rocket that takes it to space. It has to be built and designed to fit on top of that rocket. And it has to be designed to survive the violent rocket launch to the atmosphere. (Mimicking a rocket) (Laughter) But if we remove that constraint, we can build things that are as big as our imagination and vastly more capable. And if we\'ve come this far, we can take the final step and we can start to solve our resource crisis. We can move our industrial manufacturing into space, all of it. You see, manufacturing is resource consumption. We use the resources of Earth, we turn them into manufactured products, so we can sell them and do useful things. That is what drives commerce on Earth. But what if we reverse that? What if we gather and harvest all of our raw materials and resources from deep space and import them to an orbital manufacturing ring around the planet, and then return only the finished products to the surface? Let\'s use your smartphone as an example. This was created using raw materials from Earth. Yet, every single one of the raw materials in this exists in infinite quantities in space. The most expensive component of your phone is platinum, and platinum is readily available in near-earth asteroids passing by us all the time. This is created here on Earth using the resources of Earth, in a factory that produces emissions, consumes resources. They use toxic chemicals like benzene to produce this. And that factory produces hazardous waste that\'s the byproduct of manufacturing. That\'s the bad stuff: poisons, toxins, heavy metals, radiation. The problem is all of the hazardous waste from manufacturing is stuck with us here in the finite ecosystem that we live in. It\'s poisoning our air, our water, our fish, our wildlife, our food our kids! Do you know where this should not be made? (Laughter) (Breathing in) (Breathing out) (Laughter) In the only breathable atmosphere that we know of anywhere, a resource that we take for granted every minute of every day. So if we do this, we reverse the human supply chain, we push all of our mining and manufacturing outside the atmosphere, what have we done? We\'ve now zoned the Earth for residential access only. Imagine if you walked outside one day and there were no factories, no power plants, no refineries, no oil rigs, no pipelines to protest, and instead we simply allowed the planet to return to a more natural state, we intentionally stabilized our environment. We\'d have more space here on Earth, more room for the population, because we\'re not trying to live on top of our consumable resource base. And to be clear, this is not a vision about scarcity. And yes, we still have to conserve all of the precious resources we have here at home. But this is a vision about abundance. It\'s about having access to all of the resources we need to grow as a civilization. They\'re simply coming from a different place. Now, I know, I know this sounds impossible, but it\'s happening fast, faster than you could ever imagine, and it\'s already started. My kids are two. By the time they\'re in high school, they will see operational asteroid mines. They\'ll grow up in a world knowing that the resources we need do not simply come from only this planet. As a parent this gives me a lot of hope, because I want to create a world for those kids that gets better and better, not worse and worse. And when someone asks them, ""Why we should be exploring space when we have so many problems here at home?"", they will know the answer to that. The resources of space are the solutions to our greatest problems. It is only by exploring space that we safeguard this world, the one that matters the most. This is what I ask of you: believe that this is possible, because for the very first time in human history, it is possible. When we access the infinite resources of space, we do so so we can protect and preserve the single most important asset that we know of anywhere in the universe, the only place that we know of that can support human life: our home, Earth. Thank you.

For many, mobile homes offer a way to break into homeownership. But owning a mobile home is risky, because these communities are virtually invisible and have few rights. Sociologist Esther Sullivan lists the reasons why mobile homeownership is so insecure, and discusses ways to preserve one of America's best options for affordable housing.",,,20152,2018-09-04T15:58:01+00:00,"['homelessness', 'life', 'architecture', 'urban planning']",['English'],Esther Sullivan,Equal Housing Maven,"{'0:00': 'Right now, there is no state in the nation where a person working full-time for minimum wage can afford rent for a fair-market, one-bedroom home. In fact, affordable housing is so hard to find you\'ll actually spend less of your income if you can afford to buy a house rather than rent. But even an entry-level home, the cheapest homes on the market, will cost you $370,000 in L.A., $245K in Boston, $222K in Denver. What if instead you could buy a brand new, three-bedroom, two-bathroom home for $45,000, which would put your total housing costs somewhere in the range of $400-700 per month? (Cheers) (Applause) Right, exactly! It seems like you\'d be crazy not to jump at the opportunity. Well, 18 million Americans are already in on the secret. They\'ve achieved the American dream of homeownership and they\'ve done it on a budget. How? You\'re totally hoping I\'m going to say ""tiny home."" (Laughter) Mmmm. Alright. Well sort of. Enter the mobile home. Okay, it lacks all the hype, but 18 million Americans live in one. In fact, one in every five new single-family homes sold is a mobile home, and that\'s a serious statistic. It\'s serious because homeownership has long been a source of stability and a principal source of wealth in the U.S. And mobile homes are a primary way that low-income households break into homeownership and start building that wealth. Mobile homes provide a massive source of owner-occupied affordable housing at a time when the U.S. has a major affordable housing problem. We hear that a lot, right? We\'re in an affordable housing crisis. But what does that really mean? It means we don\'t have enough housing to meet the needs of millions. At the lowest income levels, the people who really need housing help, we\'re short 7.4 million units. That\'s just 35 affordable units for every 100 households that need it. The good news is that cities have begun to recognize that access to quality affordable housing is good for everyone, not just those that need it, but larger communities as well. Sociologists like myself, who study housing, show us why. Housing is an incredible source of stability, which translates into positive educational outcomes, health benefits, employment opportunities, and neighborhood safety. So recognizing this, cities are building some affordable units, but many remain unaffordable for low-income people. This problem is simply too big. We can\'t just build our way out of it. If we\'re serious about solving it, we need to preserve the affordable housing that we already have. Enter, once again, the mobile home. Mobile homes are this country\'s single largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing, and could play a major role in addressing our affordable housing crisis, but there\'s a problem. One of our largest sources of affordable housing is also one of our most insecure. Mobile homes are insecure for two reasons which are like two trains heading right for each other. The first reason isn\'t the home itself; it\'s the land. About a third of mobile homes are installed in mobile home parks, where residents own the home but rent the land. Now, this is part of what makes the housing so affordable, but it also means that homeowners can be evicted at any time if the property owner decides to sell or redevelop the park. The second reason they\'re insecure is they\'re invisible. Think for a second about the mobile home park closest to your house. Some of you can probably picture it. Maybe it\'s off a highway, behind a strip mall. But many of you might not actually know where the nearest mobile home park is, and that\'s not by accident. That\'s by design. For over a century, planning and zoning regulations have required that mobile home parks be walled in, fenced off, and, in the language of planners, visually screened from view. But perhaps the most damning of these regulations comes from laws that don\'t allow mobile home parks to be established near conventional housing. As a result, mobile home parks are disproportionately located in commercial and industrial areas. So now you can see those two trains about to collide, right? When communities of homeowners that rent the land are isolated onto commercial properties owned by a third party, they\'re the first victims of urban growth. When a big-box store is looking for a place to build, a mobile home park is an easy target. Mobile home park brokers actually make a living selling off parks for redevelopment. One broker told me that Walmart is his best client. When parks are redeveloped, communities of homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades are evicted with as little as 30 days\' notice, and entire communities are dismantled. And this is happening at an alarming rate, right now. We have an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet we are allowing one of our largest sources of affordable housing to disappear. As a sociologist, I wanted to document the effects of these mass evictions, so beginning in 2012, I rented a mobile home inside closing parks, first in Florida and then in Texas. I moved in and lived beside neighbors over 17 consecutive months as they scrambled to deal with their eviction. I then followed them for six more months after they were evicted. This is what I learned. The term ""mobile home"" is a complete misnomer. Mobile homes are not RVs, they\'re not campers. They\'re not intended to be mobile once they\'re first transported from the factory. Once installed on land, just like any other home, they settle. Moving them can cause serious structural damage and cost up to $15,000, and all of that is if they can be moved. In the parks where I lived, lucky residents lost entire savings and months of their lives dealing with eviction. Unlucky residents lost everything. Their homes were not structurally sound for relocation, and they were forced to abandon them. These residents were real people, like my neighbor Stella. Stella prided herself on being able to live independently at the age of 87. Stella was blind and completely homebound, but her cheap rent and knowing every corner of her mobile home had made that possible. Stella had paid off her home many years ago, but when her park closed, she couldn\'t afford to move it on her $790 Social Security check. In the end, Stella lost her home of 20 years and her prized independence. She moved into a guest room in her son\'s apartment. Two blocks over from Stella, Randall meticulously maintained his home. It was the first home he\'d ever owned. The first time he had me over, he apologized for it being so messy, but then he later admitted he\'d just been scrubbing the cabinets. Randall learned that this home could not be moved, and he desperately searched for housing nearby so he could keep his job. But he found nothing he could afford, even after months. On the day before Randall\'s park closed, he transitioned from homeowner to homeless, and to this day, he sleeps on a park bench about a mile from where his home once was. When these parks close, residents lose homes but also neighbors and social supports. So Stella lost the neighbors who would come and check on her, and Randall lost the people who could give him a ride when he needed it. Randall and Stella are just two of about 200 evicted homeowners I met during those two years, and while everyone\'s story is a little different, the common reality is that mobile home park closures create a cycle of housing instability that extends well beyond these moments of eviction, and that affects all of us. Housing instability means that local teachers get an influx of new kids partway through the year. It means social service providers are stretched thin managing new caseloads. It means small businesses lose reliable employees. Zoning communities into invisibility creates housing instability. But more than that, it creates social vulnerability because it\'s hard to care about what you don\'t see. But there\'s hope because over the last century we\'ve solved some of our toughest housing challenges by shining a spotlight on invisible problems. We passed the first progressive tenement housing reforms only after a photojournalist showed the world the unsafe conditions in crowded slums. We passed the Fair Housing Act only after African American Vietnam vets showed us that they\'d risked their lives for this country but couldn\'t buy a home in a white neighborhood. We passed the housing measures in the Americans with Disabilities Act only after activists with disabilities demonstrated that they couldn\'t fit through a standard entrance and into a home. So perhaps we\'re primed to bring this next housing challenge into the light. And that starts by working to change some of the very regulations that keep mobile home parks invisible. We\'re ready for this. I mean, you\'re already binge-watching ""tiny house"" shows on HGTV. (Laughter) Your Facebook feed is full of them, you love them, you want to retire in one. So we\'re ready to push for new policies that better integrate different forms of housing into the fabric of our residential communities. And we\'re ready to address that underlying land ownership issue too. We already have a model to follow: the condo model, where residents own their unit and hold the condo property collectively. There are parks that have actually tried this and it\'s working. In about 200 parks across the country, nonprofit groups have helped residents collectively get a loan so that they can buy their park and run it themselves, and residents in these parks report seeing immediate improvements in the maintenance, quality, and stability of their communities. But maybe we can take an even more important step to ensure housing security for everyone. If we can reshape our thinking about the mobile home park, we can go further to imagining housing as a basic human right. The UN and most developed nations recognize and have policies that affirm a human right to housing, for all of the reasons that we\'ve been talking about. It\'s hard to have health, wealth, and stability if you don\'t have a roof over your head. Plus, housing insecurity is expensive. It has costs for social services, businesses, schools. Those are costs we all bear, so a dollar spent on housing is a dollar saved on healthcare, infrastructure, and education. Yet the U.S. remains the only developed nation that doesn\'t guarantee a fundamental human right to shelter, but perhaps it\'s time to change that. (Applause) So if we want to, then that\'s going to require enacting legislation and shifting budgetary priorities, absolutely, but we\'ve made just these kind of legislative shifts before. And it turns out that the mobile home park provides a pretty good roadmap for why and how we should do this. Parks show us the value of homeownership for all income levels. Parks even show us how we might imagine new, collective forms of property ownership. And most importantly, parks show us that entire cities can benefit when housing is secure for everyone. Housing is one of our most fundamental human needs and perhaps our biggest blindspot. Let\'s bring our attention back home so we can create communities that work for all of us. Thank you.

In premodern Italy, owners of failed businesses that had outstanding debts were taken, completely nude, to the public plaza, where they had to hit their backside against a rock while a crowd jeered at them. In 17th-century France, failed business owners were carried to the center of the marketplace, where the beginning of their bankruptcy was announced publicly. To avoid being immediately taken to jail, they had to wear a green beret so everyone knew they were a failure. Of course, these are extreme cases, but it's important to refer to the past to remember that when the laws are too punishing to failed entrepreneurs, it disincentivizes the creation of new businesses and innovation, which are the engines of economic growth of any country."", '01:27': ""Fortunately, time has passed, and now we don't publicly humiliate entrepreneurs who fail. Still, it's not common to see big business figures publish the details of their mistakes on social media. I think everyone here can relate to the pain you feel when a project fails. But that doesn't mean we share the details of those experiences with our friends. And I understand perfectly -- I've been there, too. I had a business that failed horribly. It was a very painful experience and sharing it was very difficult. In fact, sharing it took seven years, a good amount of vulnerability and the company of my friends. This is the story of my failure."", '02:18': 'When I was at college studying business, I met a group of indigenous women who lived in a very marginalized rural community in Puebla, a state in the center of Mexico. They created beautiful handmade crafts. So when I met them and became familiar with their work, I decided that I wanted to do something to help them. And I did everything just like they had taught me at business school back then: I partnered with my friends; we procured funding; we spent a lot of time building the business and training the artisans.', '02:55': ""But we soon realized that we were rookies. The truth is, the crafts didn't sell -- or better yet, we didn't know how to sell them -- and the business plan we had made wasn't realistic. We worked for years without salary, waiting for a miracle to happen, hoping that magically, a huge buyer would appear and make the business profitable and prevent the entire project from dying. But in the end, the miracle didn't happen. We had to close the business and that broke my heart, because I began the whole project in order to have a positive impact on the life of the artisans, and I felt that I had actually had a very negative impact. I felt so guilty about what happened that for years I hid it from my résumé and from my conversations."", '03:54': 'Some time later, I was out with some entrepreneur friends, and the topic of failure came up. I took the risk and confessed to them the story of my failed business that I had kept a secret for so many years. To my surprise, my friends had similar stories. And at that moment, something became very clear in my mind: I hung out with total failures!', '04:21': '(Laughter)', '04:23': ""No, but seriously, that day I realized that we all have hidden failures. Tell me if that's not true."", '04:31': '(Audience responds)', '04:33': 'That night, I realized that sharing your failures publicly makes you stronger, not weaker. Actually, for me, it was like an exorcism. It was like a weight was lifted off of me; I had nothing to hide anymore. That night, I also realized that being open to this new place of my vulnerability helped me connect with others in a much deeper and authentic way. As a result of that experience, of sharing stories of businesses that didn\'t work, we decided to create an event series so that other people could also share their stories of failed businesses. We called it ""FuckUp Nights."" And some time later, we created the Failure Institute --', '05:15': '(Laughter)', '05:17': ""the name is awesome -- the Failure Institute. It's a research center dedicated to the study of failure and its consequences on people, businesses and society. It's been really surprising and gratifying to find that when an entrepreneur gets up on stage to tell the story of their failed business, it's not a cause for humiliation or shame, as it usually was in the past. Actually, it's an opportunity to share lessons and generate empathy. We've also found that when members of the same team get together to share their stories of failure, something magical happens: collaboration becomes easier, and the bonds become stronger."", '06:03': ""In fact, over the course of the events and the research, we've found surprising things. Perhaps among my favorites are the differences between men and women when they're faced with failure. The most common behavior among men after closing their business is to open another business but in a different sector within a year, while among women, it's more common to look for a job and postpone creating a new business for the future. Our hypothesis is that this can be attributed to women's tendency to suffer more from impostor syndrome; that is, we feel like we're lacking in some way in order to be true entrepreneurs. However, I've seen that many times, we have everything necessary, and all that's missing is that we risk taking the first step. And in the case of men, it's more common that they feel they have the necessary knowledge and they just need to apply it in another place where they'd have more luck."", '07:03': ""We've also found that there are interesting regional differences in terms of the way in which entrepreneurs recuperate after the failure of our business. For example, on the European continent, it's much more common that entrepreneurs seek out a therapist to recuperate emotionally. On the other hand, on the American continent, the most common behavior is to seek out education and training."", '07:29': ""Another finding that's really changed my life is the profound impact that public policy has on the way in which entrepreneurs decide to close their business and recuperate from the experience. For example, in my country, Mexico, the regulatory framework for closing a business is so strict that closing a business in compliance with the law can take too much time and too much money. Let's start with the money part. If things go well, if your business isn't involved in big problems, if you don't have any issues with suppliers like outstanding debts, closing a business will cost you US $2,000. which in my country is a considerable amount of money. Someone who earns the minimum salary as of 2018 would have to work 15 months to come up with that money. And with respect to time, on average, closing a business takes two years. As we know, in Mexico and in many other places in the world, the average life expectancy of a business is two years. So what happens when the life expectancy of a business is so similar to the amount of time it will take you to close it if it doesn't work? Of course, this disincentivizes the creation of new businesses and promotes the informal economy. In fact, econometric research has shown that the less time and money needed to close a business, the greater the creation of new business."", '09:04': 'So in 2017, we decided to present a series of public policy recommendations for the law that governs the closing of businesses. For a year, we worked with the Association of Entrepreneurs and with the Mexican congress, and the good news is that we managed to change the law.', '09:22': '(Applause)', '09:30': ""The idea is that once the new legislation goes into effect, entrepreneurs will be able to close their business via an online process, which will be much more accessible to everyone and shorter. The truth is, when I look back and remember that night when my friends and I confessed our failures to each other six years ago, I'm surprised, because at that moment, our intention was very simple: the only thing we wanted to do was put the subject of failure on the table so more friends could see that this was a topic to be talked about. It's not a time for humiliation as in the past, nor is it a cause for celebration, as some people say."", '10:13': 'In fact, I\'ll admit that when I hear students or people from Silicon Valley brag about failing fast or frequently, as if closing a business were no big deal, the truth is, it worries me a lot. And it worries me because I think that behind the mantra of failing fast, or ""fail fast"" as they say in Silicon Valley, there\'s a dark side. On one hand, when we insist to entrepreneurs that failing fast is the only option, it\'s possible that we\'re promoting mediocrity -- that entrepreneurs don\'t give their maximum effort, and that they give up when faced with the most minor difficulty. I also think that when we talk about failing fast, we\'re minimizing that negative impact that closing a business has. Of course, I believe failing fast is a great way to accelerate learning and avoid wasting time. But we can\'t deny the negative consequences that exist behind the death of a business.', '11:11': 'For example, when my social enterprise failed, the worst part was going back to the indigenous community and confessing to the artisans that the project had died, and that I was responsible. For many, this could have been viewed as a learning opportunity. The truth is that the death of this business meant that the artisans would lose income that they desperately needed.', '11:38': 'So today, I\'d like to propose an idea. I\'d like to propose that just as we put aside the idea of publicly humiliating entrepreneurs who fail, we should also put aside the idea that to fail fast is always best. Instead, I want to propose a new mantra: fail with awareness, or ""fail mindfully"" -- experience with full attention the entire process that closing a business involves. Remember that businesses are not entities that magically appear and disappear. Businesses are made up of people. And if a business project fails, surely, some of those people will lose their jobs or lose money. And in the case of social enterprises or green businesses, when they fail, surely the closing of the project will have a negative impact on the communities or ecosystems they were intended to benefit.', '12:35': 'But what do I mean by ""fail mindfully""? For me, it means being aware of the impact that closing a business has, being aware of the lessons learned, and above all, being aware of the great responsibility to share those lessons with the world.', '13:01': 'Thank you.', '13:02': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this instructive talk, sleep researcher Dragana Rogulja outlines the damage this does to our health and suggests some ways to combat the problem.",,,17307,2019-06-03T18:51:53+00:00,"['sleep', 'evolution', 'environment', 'health', 'science']","['English', 'Русский']",Dragana Rogulja,Assistant Professor of Neurobiology,"{'0:00': 'In case you didn\'t know, 2015 is the International Year of Light. So, I thought I\'d tell you just a little bit about the impact of light on our health. My lab uses fruit flies to study sleep and wake patterns, but what I want to talk today is primarily light and its impact on health. So, of course, we live on this planet that spins around its axis as it\'s orbiting the Sun. As a consequence of that, one of the basic facts of life on Earth is that you\'re exposed to light-dark cycles every single day. Here you see the side of the Earth that\'s facing the Sun, is light, and the other one is dark, and actually, I think we have so much light here that the dark side is kind of washed-out. But if the light was a little bit lower, you could see that there are lights all over the places on Earth, at least where there\'s solid ground, just not above water. And that\'s maybe a little bit more clear from this picture which is a composite Google image of Earth from above, at night, and I think that this is a really stunning image. It\'s stunningly beautiful, but it\'s also stunning to think about the amount of light that we\'re enveloping the Earth on, and, at the time of day when, for pretty much all of our evolutionary history, the Earth has been dark. There\'s this funny story that I don\'t know if it\'s true, but I like it, I think it\'s a good story, where in 1994, in LA, police started getting reports of people seeing a strange white cloud in the sky, and they didn\'t know what this was. They wondered if they should be worried. It turned out LA had just suffered a major earthquake which resulted in citywide blackouts. So, many people for the first time in many years, or perhaps the first time in their lives, had an unobstructed view of the night sky. In fact, what they were seeing was not a trail from some alien spaceship, but it was a glimpse of our own home galaxy, the Milky Way. This may sound quite incredible to you until I show you this next picture. Here\'s a picture that this guy, Todd Carlson, from Canada, took of his house, a fairly typical-looking house, a typical-looking sky, at least for those of us living in Boston, or surrounding areas. You can even make out some stars in the sky. In 2003, there was a blackout that affected large parts of the United States and Canada, and Todd Carlson lost his electricity, and he was smart enough to take a picture of his house at that time, and this is what it looked like. And again, here you can see this strange, white cloud in the sky which is the Milky Way. The lights that we are producing as humans, due to our ingenuity, are wiping out, basically, our view of these millions of stars in the sky. So, if we think about that, this is certainly a shame, because there are a few things that are more magnificent than a view of the night sky. But we should also think about what is this doing to our health if we\'re flooding ourselves with this amount of light pollution? So I want to I tell you that all throughout your bodies, in all of your organs, you have biological clocks that keep you in sync with the light-dark cycles of your environment that result from the Earth\'s rotation. And in your heads you have a master clock, a main clock that synchronizes all of these other clocks in your bodies. The way that this works is that light travels from a source, such as the Sun, or an artificial light source, through your eyes, and that light information is then conveyed to the brain, to the master clock that\'s in a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or the SCN. So in your eyes you of course have cells that help you see the stars, that help you form visible imagery. But you also have cells that are not a part of the visual-forming pathways, but rather their role is to capture light information and basically convey it to the brain, to tell the brain what time of day it is. So, how can I convince you that you have this clock? Well, if I closed you in a dark room where you would have no external source of light, no alarm clocks, no clocks of any kind, you would still retain rhythmic sleep and wake patterns at least for a little while, because your clock was previously trained to light-dark cycles and one of the main functions of the clock is to regulate behavioral rhythmicity. This, of course, is not an experiment that many of you would be willing to subject yourselves to, but, fortunately, there\'s an experiment that most of us have participated in, which is traveling across time zones. So, I like this quote that says, ""When you travel from America to Europe, your soul takes about three days longer to get there."" And I know this is certainly true when I travel from here to Serbia, my home country. It does take me several days basically, to feel normal, to feel aligned with the population that\'s living there. And this is because your clock takes a few days to get realigned with this new schedule. And, if you think about this, this makes sense, right? So, for pretty much all of our history, except for a blink of an eye, in our evolutionary history, nobody had a way of hopping from one continent to the other in a matter of hours. We\'re changing time zones so quickly, and in this case, nature\'s not really keeping up with what we are capable of doing. So, what is this clock? And why is it important to think about light? The clock is a molecular oscillator, the details here are not important at all, I don\'t want you to look at the names of these things on the board, but I want to point out that the clock is essentially the same in animals such as fruit flies, which my lab uses in our studies, and in mammals like mice or humans. And the first glimpses of the clock, the components of the clock, and the way that it ticks were gained in the fly, actually. What I want to stress here is that the clock is tuned by light. Some of the components of this clock are actually degraded, directly degraded by light. So, that results in the state of the clock essentially oscillating throughout the day and night. You can imagine if the composition of the clock, if some of the components are degraded, the composition of the clock will change between day and night. And then the outputs of the clock between day and night will be different. So, for instance, during the day, the state of your clock is such that you are suppressing production of melatonin, which is the hormone that helps you fall asleep, but also has other functions, such as anti-cancer and antioxidant properties. So light. Let\'s talk about blue light a little bit. When you\'re outside during the day, you\'re, of course, exposed to sunlight which consists of different wavelengths of light. But the one that\'s particularly important is blue light, because of its effect on our clock. Blue light also directly elevates your mood, it boosts your attention and your alertness. So blue light during the day is very, very good, and I\'d say that most of us don\'t spend enough time in a bright light outside. You should be for 30 to 60 minutes outside in bright light, so put some sunscreen on and go outside. The flip side of this is that when you come home at night I would dare guess that pretty much none of us spend the rest of the day when we come home, in darkness, and we\'re not in tune with the natural light and dark cycles, right? So, what we do normally is we use our computers, smartphones, tablets; we are in rooms that have high amounts of LED light. And, in particular, what\'s really bad is that these devices are very, very rich in blue light. So, what you\'re doing, every evening, when you\'re using these devices is you\'re essentially tricking your clock into thinking that it\'s still day. And since the clock during day and blue light suppress melatonin production, you\'re essentially doing that at night. Now, I\'m not naive enough to suggest you never use your computer at night, I know I wouldn\'t abide by that. But one thing that you can do, is you can turn the brightness of your screen in the evening, you can download programs that filter some of the blue light or you can use glasses that block some of the blue light. I have a little bit of news for you that maybe you\'ll perceive as bad, but I think it\'s actually very good, which is that you are very much like these guys. So, this is a close-up of a fruit fly, and you may not like if I tell you that you are like these guys. But think about it for a second, this is very good for us because now we can use these animals as a model system to understand more about sleep biology, and how light influences our clock and our health, and this is what my lab is doing. So, they sleep just like we do, they sleep at night. If we deprive them of sleep, then they crash the next day during the time they would normally be active. If we deprive them of sleep for a long time, they die; so sleep is very important for them. The same genes that regulate sleep in humans regulate sleep in flies. And when they\'re asleep they\'re disconnected, at least to a large degree, disconnected from their environment, just like we are. So, if these guys are sleeping, you need a stronger intensity stimulus to get them to react than when they\'re awake. So same thing that happens to you of course, when you\'re asleep. Two people in my lab: a postdoc, Iris Titos Vivancos and a PhD student, Michelle Frank, are asking exactly what is this barrier that\'s established in the brain that prevents sensor information from coming through during sleep? How can your same physical brain exist in two fundamentally different states? So now we\'re engaged, for instance, here I\'m speaking to you, I\'m engaged, I\'m aware of you, of my surroundings, I\'m aware of my internal state; but tonight when I go to sleep, I will be in a completely different state. And another thing that we\'re asking which is relevant to what I talked about, to light, is how light coming through the eye is regulating sleep and wake patterns? A PhD student in my lab, Bryan Song, is asking exactly this, What Bryan can do is, he can-- you can see that flies have these big eyes that take up a large part of their head. What Bryan can do is he can actually trick the cells in the eye into thinking they\'re seeing light, even when they\'re not. And this results in animals having trouble falling asleep, so it takes them about an hour and a half longer to fall asleep. You can imagine that now we can use this as a model organism to understand what it is that happens in the brain when it\'s getting light information and how this is interfacing with sleep and wake centers in the brain. And so one final thing I want to tell you is well, first I want you to think again for a moment about our evolutionary history. We evolved without alarm clocks, without any external source of information of the time of day, and we\'ve developed this way that keeps us in sync with our environment. But what we\'re exposing ourselves to every day now is very much interfering with that natural system, and I think it\'s really something to think about. So when people tell you that too much light exposure at night is not good, unfortunately, they are actually right. And the last thing I want to say is please support basic science, because this is important for all of us, and this is the way forward, I think.

So ... Why do we vote on Tuesday? Does anybody know? And as a matter of fact, Michigan and Arizona are voting today. Here\'s the answer: Absolutely no good reason whatsoever. (Laughter) I\'m not joking. You will not find the answer in the Declaration of Independence, nor will you find it in the Constitution. It is just a stupid law from 1845. (Laughter) In 1845, Americans traveled by horse and buggy. As did I, evidently.

I don\'t often travel by horse and buggy, I would imagine most of you don\'t, so when I found out about this, I was fascinated.

It would move election day from Tuesday to the weekend, so that -- duh -- more people can vote. (Applause) It has only taken 167 years, but finally, we are on the verge of changing American history.

Software engineer Brian Olson has designed a powerful algorithm that transforms gerrymandered districts into vibrant, perfectly impartial state maps so that every vote counts.",,,16246,2018-10-31T21:15:17+00:00,"['politics', 'social change', 'activism', 'technology', 'democracy']","['English', 'Español', 'Italiano', 'Português brasileiro']",Brian Olson,Redistricting Advocate,"{'0:00': ""If you've ever had the suspicion that your vote doesn't really count and the deck might be stacked against you, you might be right. In many places in this country, we don't have a functioning democracy. People might go to the polls, but they might not have a real choice when they get there. In 2010, the people of Florida were trying to do something about this. They passed a ballot initiative with almost two-thirds of the vote: a new state constitutional amendment requiring that districts be fair and not biased based on race or party. It didn't work. The state legislature sued to try and get out of these new requirements, and in subsequent court battles, the maps they made were found to be racially and partisan biased. Florida is just one example of our national problem with gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is when you take a few people from one place and a few people from another place and draw a line around them on the map to create a district with some specific demographic goal. Here's an example world with 25 people: 60% green people and 40% purple people. If you split that up into five simple districts of five people each, you can preserve that ratio in the outcome and have three districts won by green people and two districts won by purple people. But if you pack enough green people into just two districts, then you can flip that outcome and wind up with three districts where there's a purple majority. Or you can crack the purple people and split them up just right so that they don't have a majority anywhere. These strategies of packing and cracking are being used in dozens of districts throughout the country. That bright blue district in northeast Florida was found to be racially biased because it packs too many black people into one district, diminishing their influence elsewhere. That was Florida in 2012, but gerrymandering has been going on for a long time, since at least 1812, when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law a map that was drawn into a political cartoon as a monstrous, dragonesque salamander, and thus was born the gerrymander. But it's gotten a lot worse lately. The joke is that instead of voters picking their politicians, politicians are picking their voters. Why is this a problem? When you have too many seats that are gerrymandered to be safe for one party or another, the political process breaks down in some ways. I have one personal example. In 2006, I was a webmaster for a congressional campaign in California. We were in a district that was gerrymandered, say, for the other party. And the incumbent in that party didn't feel the need to take part in the campaign and wouldn't agree to show up for any debates. He just felt he didn't have to. And our party wouldn't send any help; they figured we were a lost cause. Come election day, the incumbent got the expected 60/40 result. In other places, it's even worse. In 2014, there were 32 congressional districts that went unopposed - no one else on the ballot. That's over 20 million Americans with no effective choice over who their representative in Congress is. In some places, the incumbent faces a more extreme challenger from within their own party. And whether you have an extremist upstart or a long incumbent safe seat, that politician might not feel the need to reach out across the aisle and compromise on anything because they're safe, and the legislative process grinds to a halt, and voters get more cynical. What if we could have impartial districts? What if we defined what a good district was mathematically and didn't let anyone else's agenda interfere? Florida's map might look something like this. About 10 years ago, computers got powerful enough to solve for this kind of map that follows the legal requirements of having equal population per district, contiguous districts that are each all one piece, and in this case, solving for compact districts that try to tightly represent one location or region. But I didn't know it would work when I started. Previous work in this area had been on tiny toy maps like the one I showed you earlier, and they didn't think it would scale up to a full state worth of data. But I figured I was a pretty good engineer and I'd give it a shot, and I think it worked out pretty well. So, when the 2010 census data starting coming out, I set my home computer to work, and over the next six months, it came up with 137 maps for state legislature and congressional districts all over the country. And I think the results are pretty good. Let's see another one. First, the old way. North Carolina has also been in almost constant legal battles since their maps came out a little over four years ago. Most recently, they were thrown out for racial bias just as primary season was spinning up. New maps were hastily drawn up, and the primary had to be pushed back from March until June. Voters and candidates were left in disarray. That red district in the northeast reaches into and around three other districts. That pink district in the middle pinches down as narrow as possible while reaching out to grab other areas. This is nuts. These are the visual telltales of districts that have been distorted toward some political end. The opposite of a sprawling, non-local gerrymandered map is a compact map, like this. I hope you can see the difference. You can also measure it. I measure compactness as the average distance per person to the center of their district. In the old North Carolina map, that distance was 38 miles; in my map, it's 25 miles. You can measure how sprawling and non-local a gerrymandered map is and how compact a compact map is. So, it's technically possible. How's the political situation? You might expect that there would be some resistance to this kind of change, and there is, but there is also some demand for it. The republican governor of Maryland has recently called out for national help in overturning his state's democratic gerrymander. That is one of the more contorted messes of tentacled horrors of districts I have seen in any map. (Laughter) I don't know if this is the best map, but I submit that it is a legally viable map, without some of the obvious runaround and drawbacks of the old map. There are a lot of states with divided government, with the two parties fighting over redistricting. But this shouldn't be something to fight about. Redistricting should be a bureaucratic, boring process, where you get in new census data, you turn the crank, and you get out new maps for the next 10 years. In the last few years, California, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida have passed reform of one kind or another. That shows that it's possible. Those reforms might not be perfect, and they might still need some tinkering, but we can do it. This is technically possible. Open-source software, free and verifiable, running on home computers that anyone can use can solve for these kinds of impartial maps, and the results are pretty good. This is politically possible. People want reform - even some elected officials want it. And the legal mechanisms are achievable. If we could have a change now, we could have a big effect on the future of our political process. If reform comes to enough places, enough states, we might even be able to get a national standard. And a national standard might let us really hold up our core value of equal protection under the law for all.

How a house could be built? And how we could improve with the current technology, the quality of our living spaces, the affordablility, and share these with greater markets and people. We think that this is, the present and the future of architecture. And, this house that we\'ve built in Madrid, is our manifesto, our starting point. We prefabricated towards this house, You\'re seeing a civilian engineering parts, that perfectly assembled and balanced, to demonstrate that how prefabrication could be, the way to create amazing, inspiring, and affordable spaces to live. This house was based in these engineering parts, balanced in consonance and in harmony, in equilibrium with this rock of granite of 20 tons that put all their parts together. This is our house in Madrid. The Hemeroscopium House that is full of air, and full of life, to enable it, the structure, that as you can see, defers very little the house and the structure that created it. This house is a space to share with our family, It\'s a space to share in conspiracy, in communal with outdoors. in very intimate relationship with nature. This is the space that we were living in Spain and space that we would like to have here in Boston when we came at the full of harmony. This house has been built in Madrid, and when we came to Boston, we were looking for a same space, a similar space to live. We started struggling with ""0"", in the search of housings around. MIT where I work, POPLab is found that everyone want to be closer with good schools like this one, and we discovered how insane the prices are, how expensive these houses become, and also how these houses were responding to a(n) old American dream. a lifestyle, a technology, and a formal unspecialized exact was not there where we understood house should be. And also when you come as an migrant to United States, you don\'t have financial history and this was part of the problem that we have to solve so we actually went low to high. In the sea of browser, and we found the cheapest place in the area -- I think it was a cheapest place in Massachusetts and this was how our dream house. A three base garage very... unfinished yet, but with a lot of potential. (laugh) so we thought that we could build a house of our dreams I recruited a group of young architects, and tell them ""let\'s build the technology that could be available and fit the house in Brookline."" It was the same being, but very light, that could be lifted and transported easily, and that could be estrangedly insulated to the weather in Boston. So we got hands on, and without being skilled to build a house, we crafted a prefabrication putting together their technologies from their North-Amarican tradition of building houses, with our European ones. Framing but in steel instead of in wood. creating thick walls but very light filled with forth and insulating materials that could be clad with cement boards. It\'s a different material plate, but what we created was a very affordable lightweight technology that could be packed in a container, because we are going to the move to United States but not only moving our staff, our furnishing, our memory, we are going to move their full house. So we packed it in containers, And we made the trip to United States, Their house in one side and our family in the other one. When we arrived to Brookline, two blocks away from this place, It was like receiving an Amazon pack, instead of a goodie where the full house that we had to and pack. Craned and assembled together. This is what we did in Madrid, but with these pieces that came with the kitchen, the bathroom, the closets, the furnishing, everything was embedded into these walls. These walls had to be assembled with total precision as a Swiss watch. And it took 7 days, of craning, and putting all these parts together in perfect balance. We think that this is the way, architecture should move on to make it really affordable, real technological, and overall, exciting. We think that architecture has to inspire and create a point of space that make our lives better. There the house was constructed above a garage, but the garage is still there. It\'s coated with a thin layer of vegetation that hopefully will grow next spring. But it was recycle, it wasn\'t turned on, we just created a big room above, where all our family could again enjoy all their activities without separating ourselves into rooms. A big room where we could have our meals, play, study, do some work, and where we could enjoy also, the light and the vistas from the neighbors, trees, and where at night, even all that activity after their dinner, could be transformed in to a fantastic bedroom. The bed comes from the wall and we still enjoy that big space, that we created above. Good night. (applause).

Men from the extremist group, Boko Haram, kidnapped 276 young, innocent schoolgirls. Today, 218 are still missing.', '00:34': 'I worked in and out of Nigeria for three years starting in 2007, and I remember seeing the kids going to school along dirt roads. They had smiles, they were polite, they were dressed neatly. They often talked about the books they were reading. That was tough on the kids, but they went to school for a safe place. They went to school for dreams of a better future.', '01:04': ""But turning those dreams into reality in Nigeria is difficult, because 61% of the people live at poverty level. Compare that to the US at 15%. The annual income is slightly below $6,000; compare that to the US, of $56,000. Now you see the problem. But I wasn't there in Nigeria trying to resolve an income disparity. I wasn't there trying to volunteer for a charity, or to set up a nonprofit organization. I was there to promote trade where it's very limited."", '01:48': 'I strongly believe when communities are isolated from the global economy, they could become the breeding grounds of groups like Boko Haram. Just the definition of ""Boko Haram"" stands for: ""Western education is forbidden."" That isolation in itself is dangerous. I ask you one question: Would those girls still be in school in Chibok if the conditions were different that gave rise to Boko Haram? You know, you have to wonder, what if Nigerian people had access to gain full employment? Or villages like Chibok were more integrated in the global economy? Or families could break that poverty cycle through jobs and education?', '02:40': ""Trade is a powerful weapon. Trade can fight against poverty and injustice. Trade is the gun to combat human trafficking. Trade provides medicine to the sick. Trade provides a roof for people in need of shelter. Trade is the answer to give dignity back to millions of unprivileged people. Trade is a humanitarian's strongest weapon."", '03:11': 'I work for a company that facilitates trade in 220 countries, and I\'ve personally assisted trade in 46 of them. I\'ve seen trade in action. I see trade work. But you don\'t have to take my word for it: economists have been studying it for years. In his book ""The World Is Flat,"" Tom Friedman said when countries trade with each other, they\'re the same supply chain, and they don\'t inflict military damage on each other. But Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945, said it best: ""When goods do not cross borders, armies do.""', '03:58': 'So what is this magical weapon I call ""trade""? It\'s simple: I have something you want, you have something I need. We make an exchange. But the question is: How can something so simple have such a dramatic impact on poverty and security?', '04:21': ""Let's start with poverty. There's no better example than China. Before China adopted economic reform 37 years ago, it maintained policies to keep the country poor. Then in 1979, it implemented economic reform. It allowed international trade and foreign investment. And we all know what happened -- China's the fastest-growing economy. But here's something: In that nation, in 1990, the annual income was only $980. Fast-forward to 2015, it's a little over $14,000. The poverty levels decreased [from] 84% from 1980 to 10% in 2013. The unemployment rate is at 4.1%, slightly below 4.9% of that in the US."", '05:19': 'Let\'s talk security. I started traveling in Colombia in 2010, and people were saying, ""Are you scared? Are you nervous?"" And that\'s because, 10 to 15 years earlier, the drug lords and the drug cartel would kidnap and torture people. But then the government pumped in economic resources, and they stabilized their political platform. That made a huge difference. I feel very safe going to Colombia, seeing customers.', '05:48': ""In fact, I just got back from Bogotá last week. Colombia thanks trade for improved security, reduction of poverty, and a very attractive image to the world. And I have a beautiful example of that. Colombia exported $1.3 billion of roses and flowers in 2013, with 75% coming to the US. So you see, trade clearly is a powerful weapon to fight poverty and crime. But it doesn't stop there."", '06:25': 'If I was to say ""Haiti,"" what would pop into your mind? Earthquake, hunger, poverty. Would anyone think of fashion? In 2010, the earthquake killed 230,000 Haitians, and displaced 1.5 million. Julie Colombino from Orlando, Florida went there to help. She saw humanitarian aid pour in, but she knew it wasn\'t sustainable. She started a nonprofit company called ""REBUILD globally,"" and this nonprofit taught Haitians how to make sandals out of old tires, which are very abundant there.', '07:10': ""From that nonprofit company, spun Deux Mains, a profit company, and that caught the eye of Kenneth Cole. Haiti has something the fashion world needs. They have great designs, they have top-quality craftsmanship, they have eco-friendly products. Kenneth Cole has the global brand and the distribution model to give Deux Mains shoes to the world. Trade, pure and simple. Deux Mains has made more than 2,400 pairs of sandals for Kenneth Cole, and now is in negotiation with Ron Jon, another global brand. These sandals I have on today? Yes, they've got the old tires on the bottom of them. But my purchase was made to help Haiti out of poverty. My $70 I paid wasn't a charitable contribution, it wasn't a handout. It was basic economics. It was trade at work."", '08:10': ""Julie Colombino shared with me that for every 250 pairs of shoes produced, one more Haitian is employed. So that got me thinking. In the United States, each of us buys seven and a half pairs of shoes a year. That's 2.4 billion pairs of shoes. Now just think: If one-tenth of 1% was produced in Deux Mains, that would be 2.4 million pairs of shoes. But more importantly, it would pump $120 million into the Haitian economy, and give almost 10,000 people a job. That type of employment in Haiti would have a ripple effect. And as workshop supervisor Jolina Auguste told me, the more sandals they sell, the less thieves on the street."", '09:06': ""So you see, when people have a job, security, money, they don't take other people's stuff. They don't resort to crime to survive. They don't get caught up with the drug lords like in Colombia, or terrorism that teaches them how to use AK-47s. The Global Terrorist Index report in 2015 said economic conditions play a very important part in one's decision to pursue violent extremism. The report also says Boko Haram is the most deadly terrorist organization in the world. And it recruits from the most economically marginalized regions in Nigeria."", '09:52': ""But on the other hand, if there is industrial growth, there's less domestic and international terrorism. According to a 2015 study that was published in the Oxford Economic Papers, when industrial growth increases by 1%, domestic terrorism decreases by 1%. So what does that mean? When communities gain access to the global economy through trade, they reap so many benefits."", '10:28': 'I stand here and ask you one last question: If Chibok were more connected through trade, and those young men who joined Boko Haram had an option to get a job in the formal economy, would those girls still be in school? I think so. Trade would have given them a weapon to fight terrorism. Trade would have given them hope.', '10:57': 'Thank you.', '10:58': '(Applause)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in general, we said whatever came to our heads. I wanted to be an astronaut. But that didn\'t work out. I ended up becoming a doctor, a neurologist and a researcher. And the question I always asked myself: What are the limits of human adaptation to extreme environments such as high or low temperatures, high heights, extreme depth, even outer space? As you can imagine, I don\'t have any patients, because you need to be in great health to be able to face such an extreme environment. This theme, became the research focus that I have followed throughout my whole career in science. My work place? The European Astronaut Centre of the European Space Agency. Who are my patients? The team of European astronauts. By the way, do you know that there are astronauts in space right now? Yes or no? Yes! Since 2001, there has been a permanent presence of humans in space. Six astronauts from various nationalities spend six months in the International Space Station. Every six months, there are three that come down and three that go up. The last three actually just arrived yesterday to the ISS station. The ISS, or what we call it, the International Space Station, is a grand scientific laboratory. It it right here, in a ""suburb"" of the Earth. It\'s is flying at 400 kilometers away at a velocity of 17,400 mph. The astronauts go 16 times around the Earth in 24 hours. At this velocity, instead of in 14 hours, tomorrow I could go home to my house in Paris in 24 minutes. It would be awesome! (Laughter) The astronauts -- Who are the astronauts? They are professionals, high level technicians. They are experimenters, because they perform the scientific experiments that we doctors and researches design. They are also the subjects of our experiments, because we do experiments on them. The question that you will ask, of course is: if the astronauts are all healthy, why do they need a doctor? They actually do, because my work within the research, like those of my colleagues, is to enable the astronauts to overcome their fiscal physical and psychological problems so they can live and work in space. An environment for which evolution didn\'t prepare us. On the Earth there are two fundamental factors; the force of gravity that has conditioned our entire anatomy, the rotation of Earth and the way it alternates between light and darkness, that has conditioned all of our physiology. The force of gravity has conditioned our anatomy giving us our symmetrical body, more or less, our sense of balance, the skeleton, our muscle mass, all of this is conditioned by gravity and the fight against it. There is no gravity in space, so what will happen? They will have balance problems, they will have decalcification. The skeleton that\'s up there will have a loss of muscle mass. So... we have designed a series of physical exercises with very precise protocols which take into account all of the sectors of the body, so they can stay in shape. Because, in addition, the astronauts aren\'t weighed down, so they stretch, growing about one inch. And this produces pain. Short people don\'t have expectations, because when you return, you shrink -- (Laughter) So, at this moment, we are all working to ease this type of pain, creating a ""super skin suit"", that is the suit that the astronauts use here, that we tried for the first time three months ago. I was telling you about the rotation of the Earth, and the alternating day and night. When this alternation is missing, all of our physiology is affected. And, of course, that together with all of the circadian rhythms and all of the physiological variables. From the first flights to space, we learned that the astronauts didn\'t sleep well. The quantity and quality were altered. The body temperature as well. Sleep, temperature, metabolism, nutrition -- because with all of these metabolic changes that I was mentioning, nutrition is affected. Above all, the environment of the space station, with the long working hours from 8 am to 10 pm, so they can execute all of the protocols, that we give them to do. And also the constant noise of ventilation, up to 60 to 70 decibels to circulate the air. The light that isn\'t that bright. However, in 30 years of research, we have been able to improve a few of the working conditions. The simple things: a comfortable sleeping bag, which produces in space the same pleasing sensation that we feel when we go to lie down and are between the sheets. Also, the nutrition: It\'s not only to cover nutritional and metabolic needs -- because you have to be really hungry to want to eat this -- (Laughter) But also, to take well into account the psychological aspect and the taste. That\'s why the astronaut in red, Luca Parmitano, who is a friend of mine, brought to the station his Mom\'s lasagna, to share with the entire crew. That\'s a really special moment for them. And we realized that we as doctors and researchers, have made some progress. At this time, we are able to enable astronauts to live and work for a period of time in space and bring them back to Earth, all in all, in good health. I see a lot of young people in this room, that are very lucky because at this time, we are starting a new era in space exploration. I told you that the Space Station was in the suburbs. We are returning to the Moon now, on our way to Mars. Did you realize this? Only 12 men have had the luck to walk and work on the Moon for a few hours or almost three days. The highlight images that you are seeing right now, are not science fiction. Our daily work at this time, from what we are seeing is going to happen: the first construction robots will recover the lunar dust, the regolith, to build the first shelter -- starting in 2025. After the first building is done, three years after that, man will arrive. First, for a few days. And later, they will stay for a few months. This is very fast in the video -- it will take 3 months to do it. There they will have their little house. For us it is a huge challenge. We have to anticipate new training protocols so the astronauts, when they are walking on the Moon, will be ready for anything that can happen. We also have to have or engineer health monitoring systems to be able to check on them, to detect any problems, and to be able to diagnose them. And if a problem exists, we have to intervene therapeutically, without any doctor close by. That is something very important to us. And this trip to the Moon is only the first chapter, to continue on to Mars, the target. Did you know? After many years of working in the space field, at NASA and the European Space Agency, I am starting to realize with my colleges, that at this time, we are facing the same type of problems that our predecessors had, the doctors for the Apollo program. The Apollo program, in my youth, like all of my generation, we dreamed about this program. And inevitably, this project to put a man on the Moon, influenced my choice and professional path. And now this program is still relevant. It\'s because of this, above all for the young people, I want to tell you that I really hope that you can dream and that you can live by it. In this short time that I was here with you, I hope that I have passed on a little of my enthusiasm and passion. Thank you very much.

No big fishes, no fishes at all because we have fished them quicker than they reproduce.', '00:17': 'Today, I want to propose a strategy to save sea life and the idea has a lot to do with economics. In 1999, there was a little place called Cabo Pulmo in Baja California, in Mexico which was an underwater desert. Fishermen were frustrated by not having enough fishing. So, they decided to do something nobody expected. Instead of spending more time at sea searching for the last fish, they decided to stop fishing completely. They created a national park at sea, a marine reserve.', '00:51': ""When we came back to Cabo Pulmo ten years later, this is what we saw. What had been an underwater wasteland had become a kaleidoscope of color and life. We saw it come back to its pristine state in just ten years including the return of the biggest predators such as groupers, sharks, horse mackerel... Wow! It's an extraordinary place."", '01:19': 'If you scuba dive, go to Cabo Pulmo. Those visionary fishermen are now earning more money through tourism.', '01:27': ""When we can align economic needs with conservation miracles can happen. And we have seen similar recoveries throughout the world. I spent 20 years studying human impact on the sea. But seeing with my own eyes the regeneration of places like Cabo Pulmo gave me hope, so I decided, ten years ago, to abandon my position as a university professor to dedicate my life to protecting more places at sea, like these. In the past ten years our National Geographic, Pristine Seas team have been exploring, studying, documenting the wildest places at sea and working with government to protect them. All these places are already protected, and they cover a total surface of the size of half Canada. These places are the Yellowstones and the Serengetis of the sea. They are places where you jump into the water and immediately are surrounded by sharks. And that's good, it's good! Because sharks are a sign of a healthy ecosystem. These places are time machines that show us the sea from 500 years ago, from 1,000 years ago. But they also show us how the sea of the future could be. Because the sea has an extraordinary regenerative capacity. We have seen incredible recoveries in just a few years. What we have to do is protect more endangered places so they can be wild and full of life again."", '03:01': 'So, the question is: ""Is there any way of accelerating sea protection?"" Because today just the 2 percent of the sea is protected and that\'s not enough. Studies suggest that we need to protect at least 30 percent of the sea, not just to save sea life, but ourselves, too. Because the sea gives us food, and it gives us over the half of the oxygen we breathe. It absorbs much of the carbon pollution we release into the atmosphere. We need a healthy sea to survive.', '03:33': ""So, is there a way to accelerate protecting the sea? I think there is. And one of the solutions involves looking at international waters. Coastal countries have the authority over 200 nautical miles from the coast. Everything beyond that is called international waters or the high seas, too, shown in dark blue on this map. It's two-thirds of the ocean. No country is in charge of the high seas, but everyone is. Since it's a bit like the wild west, a lot of stuff happens there, and nobody controls anything."", '04:05': 'There are two kinds of fishing, mainly, at the high seas: at the bottom and at the surface. Bottom trawling is the most destructive practice on the planet. Supertrawlers, the biggest ships on the sea, have nets so large they can hold a dozen 747 planes. Those huge nets destroy everything in their path including deep-sea coral, which lives in submarine mountains and can be thousands of years old. Surface fishing focuses mostly on species that migrate from the high seas to the coastal waters, to the water of countries, such as tunas and sharks. Many of those are endangered species because they have been fished too much.', '04:48': ""But who fishes them? Who fishes at the high seas? Until now, it was difficult to know it exactly. Countries have not been transparent concerning long-distance fishing. Today, however, satellite technology allows us to track ships individually. And this is a revolution. This is the first time we are presenting the data you're about to see. I'm going to show you the routes of two ships fishing throughout a year using an automatic satellite positioning system. This is a ship fishing tunas and sharks for months around the south coast of the African continent. A few months later, the ship goes to Japan to replenish supplies and a while after, it's fishing around Madagascar. This other ship is a Russian trawler that fishes cod in Russian waters and also in international waters in the North Atlantic. Thanks to Global Fishing Watch we have been able to track more than 3,600 ships from more than 20 countries that were fishing at the high seas. Global Fishing Watch uses satellite positioning and artificial intelligence to automatically detect whether a ship is fishing or navigating. Depending on the kind of moves, we also know what kind of fishing it is."", '06:10': ""So, along with a group of international colleagues, scientists and economists, we decided to investigate who is fishing at the high seas and who benefits from it. My colleague Juan Mayorga from the University of California in Santa Barbara has produced detailed maps of fishing effort. Effort means how much time and fuel it takes to fish in each point of the sea. We have maps for each country that fishes in the high seas: China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain represent almost 80 percent of the fishing effort in the high seas. When we join all the countries, this is what we get: the global map of fishing effort. We know the identity of each ship on the database -- that's how we know the length of the ship, the tonnage, the engine power, how many crew members are on board... With this, we can calculate the staff cost, the fuel cost, etc. This is why, for the first time, we were able to calculate the costs of fishing on the high seas. The darker the red, the higher the cost."", '07:14': 'Colleagues from the University of British Columbia have illustrated how much each country is fishing. We also know the price of the fish when it leaves the ship. Combined with the effort data, we have been able to calculate, also for the first time, the profit, the income from fishing on the high seas. We have cost and we have income, thus, for the first time, too, we were able to calculate the profitability of fishing on the high seas, the net economic profit.', '07:46': ""I'm going to show you another map. The red color means that we are losing money by fishing in that area of the ocean. The blue color means that fishing is profitable there. There it is. It seems pretty profitable, right? But there are two important factors that we have to take into account. The first is: recent researches have revealed the use of forced labor or modern slavery on the high seas. Companies use modern slavery to reduce cost and get more profit. Secondly: each year, governments subsidize fishing on the high seas with over 4000 million dollars."", '08:28': ""Let's go back to the profits map. If we pretend that there is no slavery, that people are paid minimum wage, and deduct the government subsidies from our calculation, the map becomes this. Half of fishing on the high seas is not profitable. In fact, subsidies are four times bigger than the benefits. What this economic analysis reveals is that, practically, the entirety of fishing on the high seas makes no sense. What country, what government in its right mind would subsidize and support an industry cling to exploitation and fundamentally destructive? And it's not that profitable either."", '09:18': ""So... Why don't we close all international waters to fishing? Let's create a gigantic marine reserve on the high seas. Two thirds of the global ocean. Studies from the University of California suggest that such reserve would help the species in the high seas that migrate, such as tuna, and part of that growth in abundance would help to repopulate the coastal waters of the countries and the catch of those species would also rise, as well as the benefits, because the cost of fishing would decrease and the fish that large countries are now fishing in the wild west would be fished by the coastal countries. And well, the ecological benefits would be huge: to provide a refuge of two-thirds of the ocean for species of predators, such as tunas and sharks, which are essential to the health of the ecosystem."", '10:14': ""So, protecting the high seas, the international waters, would have ecological, economic and social benefits. But, the truth is that most fishing companies don't care about the environment. They would earn more money if they didn't fish on the high seas. Moreover, this would not affect our ability to feed our growing population, because fishing on the high seas represents only 5 percent of global marine catch since the high seas are not as productive as the coastal waters.

This universe is overcrowded with life forms. It is invisible and intangible like the finest layer of reality, which we cannot notice. But it is there, and it maintains the functionality of our everyday world. Without it, we just wouldn\'t exist. Now, would you be surprised if I told you that actually everything I said before is true? Because I\'m about to tell you this. I\'m talking about the world of microbes - a separate world, yet so deeply connected to us. And the story of this connection expands far away into the past. But thanks to modern science, we are now able to read this story like a history book. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present biomolecular archeology, the science behind this history book. And I am here to share with you what fascinating things we can try to manage with this powerful modern science. But let\'s start with the term itself: biomolecular archeology. It\'s not even easy to pronounce, not to mention to try to understand the essence of this phrase. There might not be a problem with the archeology part, right? We\'ve all seen it in movies, we know what it is about, but what is ""biomolecular"" anyway? The first thing that comes to mind: it is something about biology and molecules. And this is actually correct. A biological molecule, or a biomolecule, is any molecule that is present in a living organism. Now, there are all sorts of molecules in your body, but undoubtedly, the most informative one is DNA. So, let\'s bring it back together. Biomolecular archeology enables us to study the DNA recovered from archeological samples. And not only native human DNA, which, of course, all by itself gives lots of study perspectives, but also the DNA of microbes that lived side by side with that human. This science is relatively young. About ten years ago, a massive breakthrough happened in genomic research technology. A method appeared which is called NGS, next generation sequencing, and this method significantly cuts time and costs of any genomic research. For example, have you ever heard about the Human Genome Project? It was quite a popular topic for science fiction some time ago. This project launched in 1990 with the goal to decrypt all genomic information in a human organism. At that time, with the technology of the time, it took ten years and three billion dollars to reach the goals of this project. With NGS, all of that can be done in just one day at the cost of 15,000 dollars. On the fertile soil of next generation sequencing arose biomolecular archeology because there is a great lot of genomic information to be analyzed and it just wouldn\'t be possible to manage such research with olden day technology. Now we are able to manage such research OK, ""But why?"" you could ask me. ""What benefits can we get out of this information? What can we use it for?"" The answer appears to be quite wide. Consider human health as a complex and dynamic system. Apart from genetically determined factors that are stored in our DNA, our health is severely influenced by many other factors, like our lifestyle, our diet, and our fellow microbes. One hundred trillion cells, one and 14 zeros, that\'s the approximate number of microorganisms in your body, ten times greater than the number of your own cells. Your microbial baggage occupies almost 2% of your body weight, that\'s about one and a half kilograms, approximately the weight of your liver. Or your brain. And all these are microbes. Just think about it for a second! Human microbiome, that\'s the modern term for all microbial communities inhabiting your body, has earned a close attention over the last decade. It seems that we are only beginning to discover the mysterious role that is given to microbes in the performance of our health. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. launched the Human Microbiome Project to finally study its relation to our health conditions. And since then, it has only become clearer that our notion about our fellow microbes is inexcusably poor. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, even compared the researchers involved in the project with the 15th century explorers discovering the outline of a new continent. It is now being suggested that a range of modern, widespread diseases, starting from obesity, Crohn\'s disease, other gastrointestinal problems to all sorts of allergies, autoimmune diseases, or maybe even cancer, may appear to be consequences of microbiome changes. But where do these changes come from? When did they first appear? What was the triggering factor? These are the questions we are trying to find answers to at the moment. This topic always triggers a memory of my first conscious experience with the microbial world around. My mother, like any attentive parent, tried her best to warn me against the invisible dangers of the world, and she told me a story that every time I do not wash hands before eating something, I become a reason of global microbial migration. (Laughter) An uncountable number of microbial families come together, pack their suitcases, their TVs, their favorite toys, and leave their houses forever to move to a new area which is thought to be my body. Now, I was a child with a very vivid imagination, and this story influenced me so much that I was obsessed with handwashing for a really long time. It actually took me years to overcome the thought that I\'m doing something wrong when I initiate this microbial migration, and to understand finally that they are actually willing to come, they\'ve got friends there waiting for them. I\'m not trying to convince you not to ever wash your hands again, of course not. But let\'s try to be moderate with it. We lack this microbial diversity nowadays. And as we know from ecology, the most diverse systems are the most stable ones. This might be one of the reasons for our so-called diseases of civilization. And this is exactly the type of hypothesis for biomolecular archeology to deal with. It turns out that there is a unique archaeological material that so preciously stores the enormous amount of information related to ancient human microbiome, and this material is ancient dental plaque, thanks to the fact that oral cavity hygiene was not on the list of top priorities for humans of the past. Their oral microbiome has already been partly fossilized during their lifetime in the form of dental calculus, which, in turn, stays in soil as well preserved as the skeletons themselves. Sadly, we can\'t help these fellas anymore. But they can help us by providing unique and precious information about their microbes and their health, and maybe we will have a chance to help others in the future thanks to them. There is one more vast human health-related aspect where biomolecular archaeology takes its rightful place, and this field of research expands into the valley of ancient deadly pathogens. It is true that the vast majority of microbes either provide us some kind of benefit or do not really care whether there is a human around. But there are some ancient deadly microbes that still remain an urgent problem nowadays all around the world. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One and a half million deaths in 2014. And OK, OK, I know, the first reaction I always get is like, ""Wait, aren\'t there antibiotics?"" or ""I heard there is even a vaccine; is this disease still dangerous to us after all?"" The answer is yes; tuberculosis is closer than you think. Because of some mysterious genetic phenomenon, there are people that can carry around this microbe their entire lives without developing any symptoms, and there are people that develop symptoms straight ahead after infection. Let me give you a real example of a tuberculosis microepidemic. Let\'s say a person somehow got infected. He works as a teacher in a junior school. Half a year later, one of his pupils develops symptoms. A few months later, the older sister of the pupil. A few more months later, two friends of the sister. This is how it spreads. When I was just starting my research on this topic, I myself was very surprised to know that tuberculosis worldwide remains one of the major health concerns, that on the list of infectious diseases,  it is the second most common death cause after HIV. Yes, the fight continues. Did you know we have a tuberculosis clinic right here in Latvia, just outside Riga, where many doctors and other specialists fight tuberculosis on a daily basis? To finally beat this harmful bacteria, it is crucial to understand how it evolved, how it developed resistance to antibiotics, how it spread. And these are the questions where biomolecular archaeology can help us a lot. At the moment, working in the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, we have managed to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one archaeological sample from the 17th century. We are now in the process of defining its whole genome, so we can understand what type of tuberculosis reigned at that time over the Latvian territories and where it came from. Obviously, biomolecular archaeology impacts humanities as well, such as history and anthropology. These, for example, are the excavations on the Saint Ģertrūdes Cemetery a few years ago. They started very spontaneously. There was an idea to build a shopping center in that area, and there was also information that there might be some medieval burial sites. So the Latvian Institute of History received a request to check it out. And they did actually find a medieval burial site, quite a massive one. Our archaeologists dug out over 500 skeletons, and found 2,000 more skeletons buried separately in a giant wooden box. But what was it? This couldn\'t be war because the skeletons lacked war lesions on their bones. Was it hunger? Epidemic? Archaeology itself cannot take this research any further, we have to intervene with biomolecular methods. Only then can we trace the true reason. The research process that implements the goals of the science is fascinating, even by itself. It all starts with ancient bones and teeth from cemeteries all around Latvia. We then cut out small pieces of these bones and shred them in special scientific mills to get bone powder. We then extract all the DNA that is captured in a specific bone powder sample, and then we sequence it. Sequencing is the process where the machine reads the DNA code and translates it into a four-letter code. By the way, it is absolutely fascinating how all genetic information of human beings and all other living creatures on the planet Earth can be written down using the alphabet containing four letters only. It\'s absolutely not surprising that the result of the sequencing is absolutely unreadable - gigabytes of text consisting of these four letters. It then takes time and effort to analyze these data with a variety of computational methods and programming approaches. And at the very end, we get a pretty readable list of all the microorganisms from a specific sample. The field of my research contains three sciences at once: archaeology, biology and computer science, all mixed, merged and connected. It\'s like the science itself merging and connecting humanity throughout centuries. Science is like a pyramid: you cannot lay the upper block without a foundation of the blocks beneath. And building this pyramid of healthcare throughout the entire human civilization, I believe biomolecular archaeology just opened up a new frontier for us. Where do we go from here? It\'s a question of choice, but I believe that any destination holds fascinating discoveries. But just for now, please remember that you are never alone. (Laughter) You\'ve got a hundred trillion friends that are always there for you. Think about it next time you want to wash your hands. Thank you.

She's six years old, and asked me for a camera to take a picture of them. It was easier for her to farewell her toys if she could take a picture before giving them away. Because she doesn't want to forget them. Because pictures help us remember. We grab our cell phones to snap when we feel something is special. When something moves us, we feel the urge to capture what we feel and keep it in an image, in a picture. However, we don't print photos on paper like we used to do, we share them in social networks, or we upload them to the cloud. Photography turned into something intangible, something virtual. But, what happens when we lose or erase our digital photos? Those in your computer, in that hard disk or in your phone. Is there anybody here who never lost a photo? What would happen if, for some reason we would lose all of our parents' photos or other loved ones who are no longer with us? How are we to remember them? Going back to our photos from the past is like opening the doors to a dimension where lots of memories we seem to forget still remain. And those images from the past, those cherished treasures can help us propel ourselves into the future, as well. I am a nighttime photographer. I make portraits under moonlight, in nature, close to the water. I ask the people I photograph to remain still and silent for several minutes amidst darkness. Meanwhile, I walk around them to light them up and light up the landscape with lanterns. It's a moment of quietness and connection. I went off to live in the islands of the Paraná River Delta for two years. I took with me an old camera without knowing very well where I was going, neither what was I to find there. And in time I came to know the islanders, and I invited them to be photographed under the full moon to recreate their daily life routines and jobs, but at night. And I took photos of loggers, hunters and dreamers. People living in isolation, whose only direct relationship is with water, to the rhythm of the river highs and lows. And that visual work in the Delta led me to travel around the world, and took me to Japan. I was searching for a new story to tell. I wanted to work again with a community which had some connection with water. And it happened that the curator of my exhibition, Ihiro Hayami, had relatives in a small fisher town and went with me for a visit. Ōtsuchi is located between the mountains and the sea. It's a fifteen-thousand-people town that in March 2011 went through the worst tragedy in its history. It was washed off by a tsunami with waves tall as a five-story building. Even though the alarms went off many people didn't believe it would be so strong, and remain in their homes. As a consequence many people died, close to a 10 percent of the population. And 70 percent of houses were washed away. This is why every local in Ōtsuchi has either friends or family who died in the tsunami. The power of the waves pulled the houses off their base and the sea gulped them up. Survivors were left with no shelter and had to endure a winter with temperatures below zero Celsius. Amidst this chaos and total destruction many people were trying to save their family photos. An officer of Japan's Self Defense Forces recovers a photo album inside a house in total ruin. There it was the picture of a child. The officer holds the album as if he were holding the child. I traveled to Ōtsuchi with my daughter who was five month old at the time. And the contrast of a baby in the middle of such desolation was impressive. People would take her off of my arms in order to kiss her. And I'd wonder how to tell this story that happened a year and a half ago. What could be positive out of such level of destruction. The first thing I found were big piles of rubble made of all kind of things. Twisted objects that speak about life as it used to be in Ōtsuchi. Like this vending machine or this fishing elements, car remains ... or what's left of a house. A lamp turned into a Moebius strip, the symbol of infinite time. As a contrast to these mountains of rubble there was this town flattened by water. The skeletons of the houses, marked on the ground were empty spaces, filled with stories. So I invited the survivors to go back to those spaces where their houses or workplaces used to exist. And many accepted, but in general, the kids didn't want to. I photographed them during the night as they remained silent and still during the ten minutes each photo took. The scenes were so sad, nothing had color. She is Haruko Okano, a librarian, and she's sitting on the remains of Ōtsuchi's Library, where she worked. This is the Second Volunteers Firefighters Squad of Ōtsuchi inside of what was the fire station. The fireman standing up was in charge of closing the anti-tsunami gates. This is Yoshihiro Ogayu, monk of Kogan-ji temple. The temple was a refuge in case of tsunami but even so it was destroyed. His dad and his son died there. When that first trip to Ōtsuchi was over I found a photo album in the middle of the street. It had laid there for a year and a half without having anyone pick it up. It was all wet, heavy and it stank just like a dead animal. It was tainted with color bubbles gushing from the photos that blended together. I took a picture of it without giving it much of a thought and I came back. Once in Buenos Aires, the Ōtsuchi experience felt much like a far away dream. It filled me up with doubt: Why did I have to tell this story, if I came from the other end of the world? What did it had to do with me? Why had I photographed the survivors in black and white if the reference of my work is color? And while I made myself these questions, my own life began to crumble. Soon after breakup, my daughter's mother went off to live in another country. So I took on myself Lara's upbringing, she was a one-year-old baby. Project Ōtsuchi was put on hold, because now it was me the one who had to survive and reinvent myself. And some months later, revisiting the work the family photo album image popped up again. But in this second view I grasped it in a different way. I thought I saw a painter's palette. So I took the main colors of that album to create my own color palette. And I used those colors created by the force of the tsunami to color the images of the survivors. And little by little, all the gray scenes turned into something colorful. I used color as a bridge to connect the present and the past, as the hub between their photos and mine. Now I was feeling connected with Ōtsuchi once again. Two years passed since until I was able to return to Japan  to search for other recovered photos and find new colors to paint with. There I met Mikio Komukai, a nice man who had this NGO that was recovering family photos to send them back to their owners. And with his help and the permission of Ōtsuchi's government I gained access to that impressive archive of thousand of destroyed photos. Contemplating those pictures I realized the intangible damage the people of Ōtsuchi were facing; the damage to their memory and identity. Those blurred images were the measure of their loss. The firefighters of Ōtsuchi. I traveled a total of six times to finish the project and publish a book. And this is the last picture I took with my two assistants, Mayumi Suzuki and Kazuhiko Chikaoka, who both lost their parents to the tsunami. We built an arch with plastic tubes which they arranged in different positions over the remains of this house. And if you look carefully at the photo you will see that their hands are holding this house of light. In 2016 the government of Ōtsuchi invited me to show my project, but I had a feeling that it was not over. There was something left to do. So I suggested that we put together a collective exhibition which we set up in the gymnasium of a temporary school. And we invited high school students and the people in town to take photos. Now the kids did want to join in. We gave them disposable cameras with one assignment: to tell their lives in pictures, their intimate whereabouts. Five years away from the tsunami there were children back in the streets taking photos, recording its life. And together, in community, we created a small photo archive of what Ōtsuchi is today. The people in town took pictures to create new memories: The memories of the future of Ōtsuchi. As for me, I started my own photo album telling my life and my travels with Lara. And here we are in Japan, saying goodbye to the sea of Ōtsuchi. Thank you very much.
