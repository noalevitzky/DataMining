Alexander had never seen anything like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge golden neck rings and colorful cloaks. They were Keltoi or Celts— a collection of independent tribes spread across Europe. Philip Freeman details the rise and fall of the ancient Celts. [Directed by Paper Panther, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Stephen LaRosa].",00:04:52,4.866666666666667,270921,2020-07-21T14:32:28+00:00,"['TED-Ed', 'animation', 'education', 'history', 'war', 'religion', 'world cultures', 'culture', 'art', 'poetry']","['English', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', '中文 (繁體)']",Philip Freeman,Educator,"{'00:13': 'One summer evening in 335 BCE, Alexander the Great was resting by the Danube River after a day of fighting the Scythian tribes when a band of strangers approached his camp. Alexander had never seen anything like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge golden neck rings and colorful cloaks— so he invited them to feast with him. They proudly said they were Keltoi or Celts who came from the far-away Alps. Alexander asked what they feared the most in the world, hoping they would say him. They laughed and said they feared nothing at all.', '00:56': 'This is one of the earliest stories about the ancient Celts. While we don’t know where the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time they had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain and Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire, and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought their enemies.', '01:37': 'Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies.', '02:21': 'But the Celts were much more than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen, artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments of warrior kings— and composed biting satires about cowardly or selfish leaders.', '02:42': 'The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid, or question their decisions.', '03:24': 'In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite against their common enemy under the leadership of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France.', '04:13': 'Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle against the enemy.', '04:38': 'By the end of the 1st century CE, Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.'}"

Some people call this ""citizen journalism,"" other people call it ""collaborative journalism."" But really, it kind of means this: for the journalists, people like me, it means accepting that you can\'t know everything, and allowing other people, through technology, to be your eyes and your ears. And for people like you, for other members of the public, it can mean not just being the passive consumers of news, but also coproducing news. And I believe this can be a really empowering process. It can enable ordinary people to hold powerful organizations to account.', '00:46': ""So I'm going to explain this to you today with two cases, two stories that I've investigated. And they both involve controversial deaths. And in both cases, the authorities put out an official version of events, which was somewhat misleading. We were able to tell an alternative truth utilizing new technology, utilizing social media, particularly Twitter. Essentially, what I'm talking about here is, as I said, citizen journalism."", '01:14': ""So, to take the first case: this is Ian Tomlinson, the man in the foreground. He was a newspaper vendor from London, and on the 1st of April 2009, he died at the G20 protests in London. Now, he had been -- he wasn't a protester, he'd been trying to find his way home from work through the demonstrations. But he didn't get home. He had an encounter with a man behind him, and as you can see, the man behind him has covered his face with a balaclava. And, in fact, he wasn't showing his badge numbers. But I can tell you now, he was PC Simon Harwood, a police officer with London's Metropolitan Police Force. In fact, he belonged to the elite territorial support group. Now, moments after this image was shot, Harwood struck Tomlinson with a baton, and he pushed him to ground, and Tomlinson died moments later."", '02:07': ""But that wasn't the story the police wanted us to tell. Initially, through official statements and off-the-record briefings, they said that Ian Tomlinson had died of natural causes. They said that there had been no contact with the police, that there were no marks on his body. In fact, they said that when police tried to resuscitate him, the police medics were impeded from doing so, because protesters were throwing missiles, believed to be bottles, at police. And the result of that were stories like this. I show you this slide, because this was the newspaper that Ian Tomlinson had been selling for 20 years of his life. And if any news organization had an obligation to properly forensically analyze what had been going on, it was the Evening Standard newspaper. But they, like everyone else -- including my news organization -- were misled by the official version of events put out by police. But you can see here, the bottles that were supposedly being thrown at police were turned into bricks by the time they reached this edition of the newspaper. So we were suspicious, and we wanted to see if there was more to the story. We needed to find those protesters you see in the image, but, of course, they had vanished by the time we started investigating. So how do you find the witnesses? This is, for me, where it got really interesting. We turned to the internet."", '03:24': ""This is Twitter; you've heard a lot about it today. Essentially, for me, when I began investigating this case, I was completely new to this; I'd signed up two days earlier. I discovered that Twitter was a microblogging site. It enabled me to send out short, 140-character messages. Also, an amazing search facility. But it was a social arena in which other people were gathering with a common motive. And in this case, independently of journalists, people themselves were interrogating exactly what had happened to Ian Tomlinson in his last 30 minutes of life. Individuals like these two guys. They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid after he collapsed. They phoned the ambulance. They didn't see any bottles, they didn't see any bricks. So they were concerned that the stories weren't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be. And again, through social media, we started encountering individuals with material like this: photographs, evidence. Now, this does not show the attack on Ian Tomlinson, but he appears to be in some distress. Was he drunk? Did he fall over? Did this have anything to do with the police officers next to him? Here he appears to be talking to them. For us, this was enough to investigate further, to dig deeper. The result was putting out stories ourselves."", '04:49': ""One of the most amazing things about the internet is: the information that people put out is freely available to anyone, as we all know. That doesn't just go for citizen journalists, or for people putting out messages on Facebook or Twitter. That goes for journalists themselves, people like me. As long as your news is the right side of a paywall, i.e, it's free, anybody can access it. And stories like these, which were questioning the official version of events, which were skeptical in tone, allowed people to realize that we had questions ourselves. They were online magnets. Individuals with material that could help us were drawn toward us by some kind of gravitational force. And after six days, we had managed to track down around 20 witnesses. We've plotted them here on the map."", '05:35': ""This is the scene of Ian Tomlinson's death, the Bank of England in London. And each of these witnesses that we plotted on the map, you could click on these small bullet points, and you could hear what they had to say, see their photographic image and at times, see their videographic images as well. But still, at this stage, with witnesses telling us that they'd seen police attack Ian Tomlinson before his death, still, police refused to accept that. There was no official investigation into his death."", '06:06': ""And then something changed. I got an email from an investment fund manager in New York. On the day of Ian Tomlinson's death, he'd been in London on business, and he'd taken out his digital camera, and he'd recorded this."", '06:26': '(Video) Narrator: This is the crowd at G20 protest on April the 1st, around 7:20pm. They were on Cornhill, near the Bank of England. This footage will form the basis of a police investigation into the death of this man. Ian Tomlinson was walking through this area, attempting to get home from work.', '06:44': '(People yelling)', '06:59': ""We've slowed down the footage to show how it poses serious questions about police conduct. Ian Tomlinson had his back to riot officers and dog handlers and was walking away from them. He had his hands in his pockets. Here the riot officer appears to strike Tomlinson's leg area with a baton. He then lunges at Tomlinson from behind. Tomlinson is propelled forward and hits the floor."", '07:27': '(People yelling)', '07:37': 'Paul Lewis: OK. So, shocking stuff. That video wasn\'t playing too well, but I remember when I first watched the video for myself, I\'d been in touch with this investment fund manager in New York, and I had become obsessed with this story. I had spoken to so many people who said they had seen this happen, and the guy on the other end of the phone was saying, ""Look, the video shows it."" I didn\'t want to believe him until I saw it for myself. It was two o\'clock in the morning, I was there with an IT guy -- the video wasn\'t coming. Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it. And I realized: this is really something quite significant. Within 15 hours, we put it on our website. The first thing police did was they came to our office -- senior officers came to our office -- and asked us to take the video down. We said no. It would have been too late, anyway, because it had traveled around the world. And the officer in that film, in two days\' time, will appear before an inquest jury in London, and they have the power to decide that Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.', '08:31': ""So that's the first case; I said two cases today. The second case is this man. Now, like Ian Tomlinson, he was a father, he lived in London. But he was a political refugee from Angola. And six months ago, the British government decided they wanted to return him to Angola; he was a failed asylum seeker. So they booked him a seat on an airline, a flight from Heathrow. Now, the official version of events, the official explanation, of Jimmy Mubenga's death was simply that he'd taken ill. He'd become unwell on the flight, the plane had returned to Heathrow, and then he was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead."", '09:08': 'Now, what actually happened to Jimmy Mubenga, the story we were able to tell, my colleague Mathew Taylor and I, was that, actually, three security guards began trying to restrain him in his seat; when was resisting his deportation, they were restraining him in his seat. They placed him in a dangerous hold. It keeps detainees quiet, and he was making a lot of noise. But it can also lead to positional asphyxia, a form of suffocation. So you have to imagine: there were other passengers on the plane, and they could hear him saying, ""I can\'t breathe! I can\'t breathe! They\'re killing me!"" And then he stopped breathing. So how did we find these passengers? In the case of Ian Tomlinson, the witnesses were still in London. But these passengers, many of them, had returned to Angola. How were we going to find them?', '09:50': 'Again, we turned to the internet. We wrote, as I said before, stories -- they\'re online magnets. The tone of some these stories, journalism professors might frown upon because they were skeptical; they were asking questions, perhaps speculative, maybe the kind of things journalists shouldn\'t do. But we needed to do it, and we needed to use Twitter also. Here I\'m saying an Angolan man dies on a flight. This story could be big; a level of speculation. This next tweet says, ""Please RT."" That means ""please retweet,"" please pass down the chain. And one of the fascinating things about Twitter is that the pattern of flow of information is unlike anything we\'ve ever seen before. We don\'t really understand it, but once you let go of a piece of information, it travels like wind. You can\'t determine where it ends up. But strangely, tweets have an uncanny ability to reach their intended destination. And in this case, it was this man. He says, ""I was also there on the BA77"" -- that\'s the flight number -- ""And the man was begging for help, and I now feel so guilty that I did nothing.""', '10:52': ""This was Michael. He was on an Angolan oil field when he sent me this tweet. I was in my office in London. He had concerns about what happened on the flight. He'd gone onto his laptop, he typed in the flight number. He had encountered that tweet, he had encountered our stories. He realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events; we were skeptical. And he contacted me. And this is what Michael said."", '11:21': '(Audio) Michael: I\'m pretty sure it\'ll turn out to be asphyxiation. The last thing we heard the man saying was he couldn\'t breathe. And you\'ve got three security guards, each one of them looked like 100-kilo plus, bearing down on him, holding him down -- from what I could see, below the seats. What I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats. And all I could see was his head sticking up above the seats, and he was hollering out, you know, ""Help me!"" He just kept saying, ""Help me! Help me!"" And then he disappeared below the seats. And you could see the three security guards sitting on top of him from there. For the rest of my life, I\'m always going to have that in the back of my mind. Could I have done something? That\'s going to bother me every time I lay down to go to sleep now. Wow; I didn\'t get involved because I was scared I might get kicked off the flight and lose my job. If it takes three men to hold a man down, to put him on a flight, one the public is on, that\'s excessive. OK? If the man died, that right there is excessive.', '12:42': ""PL: So that was his interpretation of what had happened on the flight. And Michael was actually one of five witnesses that we eventually managed to track down, most of them, as I said, through the internet, through social media. We could actually place them on the plane, so you could see exactly where they were sat. And I should say at this stage that one really important dimension to all of this for journalists who utilize social media and who utilize citizen journalism is making sure we get our facts correct. Verification is absolutely essential. So in the case of the Ian Tomlinson witnesses, I got them to return to the scene of the death and physically walk me through and tell me exactly what they had seen. That was absolutely essential. In the case of Mubenga, we couldn't do that, but they could send us their boarding passes. And we could interrogate what they were saying and ensure it was consistent with what other passengers were saying, too. The danger in all of this for journalists -- for all of us -- is that we're victims of hoaxes, or that there's deliberate misinformation fed into the public domain. So we have to be careful."", '13:46': ""But nobody can deny the power of citizen journalism. When a plane crashes into the Hudson two years ago, and the world finds out about this because a man is on a nearby ferry, and he takes out his iPhone and photographs the image of the plane and sends it around the world -- that's how most people found out initially, in the early minutes and hours, about the plane in the Hudson River."", '14:09': ""Now, think of the two biggest news stories of the year. We had the Japanese earthquake and the tsunami. Cast your mind's eye back to the images that you saw on your television screens. They were boats left five miles inland. They were houses being moved along, as if in the sea. Water lifting up inside people's living rooms, supermarkets shaking -- these were images shot by citizen journalists and instantly shared on the internet."", '14:38': ""And the other big story of the year: the political crisis, the political earthquake in the Middle East. And it doesn't matter if it was Egypt or Libya or Syria or Yemen. Individuals have managed to overcome the repressive restrictions in those regimes by recording their environment and telling their own stories on the internet. Again, always very difficult to verify, but potentially, a huge layer of accountability. This image -- and I could have shown you any, actually; YouTube is full of them -- This image is of an apparently unarmed protester in Bahrain. And he's being shot by security forces. It doesn't matter if the individual being mistreated, possibly even killed, is in Bahrain or in London. But citizen journalism and this technology has inserted a new layer of accountability into our world, and I think that's a good thing."", '15:36': 'So to conclude: the theme of the conference, ""Why not?"" -- I think for journalists, it\'s quite simple, really. I mean, why not utilize this technology, which massively broadens the boundaries of what\'s possible, accept that many of the things that happen in our world now go recorded, and we can obtain that information through social media? That\'s new for journalists.', '15:58': 'The stories I showed you, I don\'t think we would have been able to investigate 10 years ago, possibly even five years ago. I think there\'s a very good argument to say that the two deaths, the death of Ian Tomlinson and the death of Jimmy Mubenga, we still today wouldn\'t know exactly what had happened in those cases. And ""Why not?"" for people like yourselves? Well, I think that\'s very simple, too. If you encounter something that you believe is problematic, that disturbs you, that concerns you, an injustice of some kind, something that just doesn\'t feel quite right, then why not witness it, record it and share it? That process of witnessing, recording and sharing is journalism.', '16:42': 'And we can all do it. Thank you.'}"

And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes. And he was here, as you well know, in \'35. And you\'d think he was chasing finches, but he wasn\'t. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them as very ""common."" This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it until the \'80s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places, so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is, we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here?', '01:19': ""The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline. (Laughter) Because I was there in '71, studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn, and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn."", '01:45': 'And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees, as you can see, and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. When I went there 27 years later, the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.', '02:30': ""My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s -- Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat, quite ugly, is called the Mutiara 4. And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught, we didn't have words for it. What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea. And 90 percent of our catch were sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debris, the piles of debris, were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down."", '03:35': ""And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented."", '04:18': ""We transform the world, but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this, something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply. And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then, they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were."", '05:26': ""Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline."", '06:17': 'And the question is, why do people accept this? Well because they don\'t know that it was different. And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it\'s not ""scientific."" So you have a situation where people don\'t know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don\'t trust the sources of the past.', '07:15': 'And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline.', '07:50': 'How about the people who can\'t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example? There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like ""Avatar."" (Laughter) And if you think about ""Avatar,"" if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery? Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation, it\'s the only one I will provide, is for Cameron to do ""Avatar II"" underwater.', '08:46': 'Thank you very much.', '08:48': '(Applause)'}"

Motion pictures have been in existence for more than a hundred years. Filmmaking hasn\'t changed for the dimensional mindset. Placing the camera in a scene and pressing ""record"" hasn\'t changed. Filmmaking is still a frontal experience, and creating the film has the possibility to follow the same direction of the content creation. We still stand in front of a flat image, watching the fiction.', '00:40': ""There's nothing wrong with it. I love watching movies and going to the theaters. The experiences can be such emotional experiences. The art and craft of emotional experiences within a frame can be so strong to drive a stronger emotion. The question we're asking is, How the experience of motion pictures can exist beyond the flat screen. How can we start creating content for the next generation of content experiences?"", '01:08': ""Traditionally, when we imagine a scene, we look at the frame and the composition. We have to think about how we create depth and parallax using foreground, background elements as the camera moves. With the technology today and devices of VR glasses, AR glasses, smart devices, allowing three-dimensional and full navigation in space, we have the possibility to enable audiences to experience content from multiple perspectives. What we have to think about is how we take this technology, all the capabilities, and enable the experience to move farther away inside the scene. Now we're not talking about video games or computer-generated actors, which look tremendously realistic. We're talking about real actors and real performance, performing onstage. We have to start thinking how we capture the actors and how we capture the real scene in order to immerse inside."", '02:10': ""Now, we're familiar with the 360-degree video, where you place a camera inside the scene and you can create this beautiful panoramic image all around you, but from the same aspect, filmmaking is still frontal. In order to emerge fully inside the scene, we will need to capture the light from all the possible directions. We will have to surround the scene with an enormous amount of sensors, with all possible capabilities to capture the light and enable us to emerge inside afterwards again."", '02:44': 'Now, in this setup, there\'s no more foreground or background or a camera placed in space but hundreds of sensors capturing the light and capturing the motion from all the possible directions. With the new technological advancements, we can start looking at 3D photography, capturing the light from multiple perspectives, enabling us to reconstruct the object. This is like photography in 3D space. Now, with these technological advancements, we can record video not just as a flat image but as a volume. This is what we call ""volumetric video,"" and it has the capability to record every action of the scene as a full three-dimensional volume.', '03:27': ""Now, what is a voxel? A voxel is like a three-dimensional pixel, but instead of being a flat image square, staying light and colored, it's like a three-dimensional cube in space, with x, y, and z positions. This enables us to create a full capture of the scene from any perspective. Now this renders a fully light-immersive scene from multiple perspectives. This capability requires an insane amount of information to be processed. We will have to capture the light from an enormous amount of cameras to create this information."", '04:11': 'Now, in order to do such a thing, we would need a setup that would host a numerous amount of cameras installed in a stage and a stage big enough in order to fit a full cinematic experience.', '04:28': ""Now that sounds like a crazy idea, but that's exactly what we did. For the last three years, we have been building a huge volumetric camera chamber. It's 10,000 square feet of a stage, enabling to capture the action from any location. We have deployed hundreds of cameras, sending a tremendous amount of information to a huge data center powered by Intel supercomputers. The ability to have this 10,000 feet enables us to fit any kind of action, any kind of performance. It is the size of an average Broadway stage. We call it Intel Studios, and it's the largest volumetric stage in the world, with the objective of enabling and exploring the next generation of this immersive media filmmaking."", '05:23': ""Now, to test these ideas, we were thinking about what we can do as the first scene to try it out. So we chose the Western scene. We brought horses, set designers, dirt, everything needed to create the full scene of a Western. But this time, there was no camera inside. There was nothing really moving besides all the cameras installed outside. The challenge of the actors was tremendous. They have to perform a flawless action visible from all the directions. There's no possibility to hide a punch or not show the action. Everything is captured and everything is seen."", '06:10': ""The output of the capture -- this is our future capture -- opened our eyes for the immense capabilities. It was like a full 3D scan of the entire scene. We were able to move around and travel in the space. The thing about this, it's not anymore about perceiving the light emitted from a screen but now traveling inside the light, traveling inside the scene. This obviously opens possibilities for an enormous amount of storytelling and methodologies of creation. This is the possibilities of your personal narrative, the possibility of creating your own story inside, or maybe following other stories. Let's take a look at one of the last renders and see."", '06:54': '(Music)', '06:55': ""What you're seeing here is full volumetric video, and there's no physical camera in the scene."", '07:00': '(Music)', '07:02': 'We have the full control', '07:04': '(Music, sounds of combat)', '07:06': 'of space and time.', '07:07': '(Music, sounds of combat)', '07:18': 'Now, again, no physical camera was here. Everything was captured surrounding.', '07:24': 'Now, this is very nice, but what if we wanted to see the scene, maybe, from the eyes of the horse? Well, we can do that as well.', '07:33': '(Horse galloping)', '07:34': ""So what you're seeing right now is the same action, but this time, we're watching exactly from the eyes of the horse. The possibilities are, well, unlimited."", '07:45': '(Applause)', '07:46': 'Thank you.', '07:48': '(Applause)', '07:51': 'So this is all great for creators and storytellers. It really opens a huge canvas for a different type of storytelling and moviemaking. But what about the audience? How can the audience experience this differently? In order to [create] our explorations, we partnered with Paramount Pictures in order to explore immersive media in a Hollywood movie production. Together with the director Randal Kleiser, we reimagined the iconic movie of 1978, ""Grease."" Some of you know it, some of you don\'t. A 40-year-old movie, amazing experience. And our goal was really to look at how we can take this iconic action and dance and bring it deeper into the experience, bring it deeper into the audience. Imagine that you can not just watch the movie but get inside it and dance with the actors and dance with the performance. Now we\'re breaking, really, the traditional 2D mindset of thinking, and bringing a much richer possibility of moviemaking and content creation.', '08:57': ""But why watch it on the screen?

But it doesn't have a happy ending. Once upon a time, I was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist."", '00:24': ""Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives and one PhD later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean. I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy. I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and cultures all depend on the sea."", '00:53': ""In the midst of all this, I fell in love. With a fish. There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs, but the ones I just can't get out of my head are parrotfish. Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world, there are 100 species, they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms, but that's the boring stuff. I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish."", '01:22': ""First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae. They are the lawn mowers of the reef. This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land. And there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish left out on the reefs to mow it all down."", '01:46': ""OK, second amazing thing. After all that eating, they poop fine white sand. A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. Sometimes, when scuba diving, I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down. So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach, maybe thank of parrotfish."", '02:16': '(Laughter)', '02:17': 'Third, they have so much style. Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange, polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful. Plus, in true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life. A juvenile outfit, an intermediate getup, and a terminal look.', '02:39': ""Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male, termed sequential hermaphroditism. These large males then gather harems of females to spawn. Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo. And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive strategies."", '03:01': 'Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body. This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites, so they can sleep soundly. I mean, how cool is this?', '03:23': '(Laughter)', '03:25': 'So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory.', '03:34': '(Laughter)', '03:35': ""But with this love comes heartache. Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish. Spearfishing took out the large species, midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species. As both a marine biologist and a single person, I can tell you, there aren't that many fish in the sea."", '04:03': '(Laughter)', '04:05': ""And then, there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture, and as bustling as carnival. Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years. An entire ecosystem erased. This is devastating, because hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on reefs for their nutrition and income. Let that sink in."", '04:42': ""A little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs -- Very Important Parrotfish. Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem. These are critical efforts, but it's not enough. As I stand here today, only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected. Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already gone. We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. And we, humans, are causing it. We also have the solutions. Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land. But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes, and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it."", '05:42': 'Each of us can contribute, though. With our votes, our voices, our food choices, our skills and our dollars. We must overhaul both corporate practices and government policies. We must transform culture. Building community around solutions is the most important thing.', '06:03': ""I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this magnificent planet. Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter. Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope, but rather a desire to be useful. Because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending."", '06:34': 'Thank you.', '06:35': '(Applause)'}"

She published two novels, but is perhaps best known for her short stories, which explored small-town life with stinging language, offbeat humor, and delightfully unsavory scenarios.', '00:46': 'In her spare time O’Connor drew cartoons, and her writing is also brimming with caricature. In her stories, a mother has a face “as broad and innocent as a cabbage,” a man has as much drive as a “floor mop,” and one woman’s body is shaped like “a funeral urn.”', '01:05': 'The names of her characters are equally sly. Take the story “The Life You Save May be Your Own,” where the one-handed drifter Tom Shiftlet wanders into the lives of an old woman named Lucynell Crater and her deaf and mute daughter.', '01:18': 'Though Mrs. Crater is self-assured, her isolated home is falling apart. At first, we may be suspicious of Shiftlet’s motives when he offers to help around the house, but O’Connor soon reveals the old woman to be just as scheming as her unexpected guest– and rattles the reader’s presumptions about who has the upper hand.', '01:37': 'For O’Connor, no subject was off limits. Though she was a devout Catholic, she wasn’t afraid to explore the possibility of pious thought and unpious behavior co-existing in the same person. In her novel The Violent Bear it Away, the main character grapples with the choice to become a man of God – but also sets fires and commits murder. The book opens with the reluctant prophet in a particularly compromising position: “Francis Marion Tarwater’s uncle had been dead for only half a day when the boy got too drunk to finish digging his grave.” This leaves a passerby to “drag the body from the breakfast table where it was still sitting and bury it […] with enough dirt on top to keep the dogs from digging it up.”', '02:18': 'Though her own politics are still debated, O’Connor’s fiction could also be attuned to the racism of the South. In “Everything that Rises Must Converge,” she depicts a son raging at his mother’s bigotry. But the story reveals that he has his own blind spots and suggests that simply recognizing evil doesn’t exempt his character from scrutiny.', '02:37': 'Even as O’Connor probes the most unsavory aspects of humanity, she leaves the door to redemption open a crack. In “A Good Man is Hard to Find,” she redeems an insufferable grandmother for forgiving a hardened criminal, even as he closes in on her family. Though we might balk at the price the woman pays for this redemption, we’re forced to confront the nuance in moments we might otherwise consider purely violent or evil.', '03:01': 'O’Connor’s mastery of the grotesque and her explorations of the insularity and superstition of the South led her to be classified as a Southern Gothic writer. But her work pushed beyond the purely ridiculous and frightening characteristics associated with the genre to reveal the variety and nuance of human character. She knew some of this variety was uncomfortable, and that her stories could be an acquired taste – but she took pleasure in challenging her readers.', '03:27': 'O’Connor died of lupus at the age of 39, after the disease had mostly confined her to her farm in Georgia for twelve years. During those years, she penned much of her most imaginative work. Her ability to flit between revulsion and revelation continues to draw readers to her endlessly surprising fictional worlds. As her character Tom Shiftlet notes, the body is “like a house: it don’t go anywhere, but the spirit, lady, is like an automobile: always on the move.”'}"

The adventurers have recovered the first artifact— the Node of Power— and have come to the 198forest in search of the second.', '00:42': 'Here they’re welcomed by the director of the colony, Octavia. She established this treehouse sanctuary after the robots freed everyone from having to work. It was meant to be a haven where people could follow their passions, take up crafts, and find fulfillment. Which they did… at first. Some years ago everyone forgot the point. They abandoned arts and crafts and instead just painted and exhibited pictures of themselves over, and over, and over.', '01:11': 'The location of the second artifact is no secret; it’s in a tower, guarded by a garrison of bots, a bottomless ravine, and who knows what other traps. As soon as the tower went up with the node inside, human communication across the land went dark. Octavia’s been after it for years, but try as she might, the defenses thwart her.', '01:34': 'In order to even get to the tower, the team will need a distraction. Octavia has an idea: stir up the people through some well-intentioned vandalism.', '01:45': 'The residents’ paintings are all squares that come in different sizes, all an odd number of pixels across. Helper-bots pick up the finished portraits and hang them in public places for everyone to admire.', '01:58': 'There’s a slim margin of time when Hedge can access the paintings. If he were to deface each one with an X, the people would blame the helper-bots, creating just the distraction the team needs.', '02:12': 'If only it were so easy. Hedge can’t just paint an X— his painting processor requires very specific instructions. Treating the paintings as square grids, he can fill in one pixel, or little square, at a time. He can move forwards and make 90 degree turns over the canvas, but can’t move diagonally.', '02:33': 'How does Ethic program Hedge to paint an X over each portrait?', '02:38': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '02:47': 'Here’s a hint.', '02:48': 'Try drawing a square grid like this, and simulating Hedge’s path over it. What patterns can you find to guide him?', '02:57': 'Pause now to figure it out for yourself.', '03:01': 'The challenge here is to craft a set of instructions that will work for any square grid. Fortunately, one of the strengths of programming is the flexibility to solve not just one problem, but a whole class of them all at once. It often helps to start with one case, and work towards the general.', '03:20': 'Let’s say we had this square. Hedge can measure the length of its sides and store that number as a variable. Now, what we need is a plan for how Hedge will paint an X, pixel by pixel. There’s more than one right answer for how to do this; let’s look at two.', '03:37': 'First, what if Hedge went row by row, like a typewriter? If it’s a 9 pixel by 9 pixel painting, in the first row he’d paint, skip 7, and then paint again. In the second row he’d skip the first, paint, skip 5, and paint. And so on. The pattern here is that for each row the pixels skipped at the beginning go up by one, and the pixels skipped in the middle go down by 2. Things get more complicated when Hedge reaches the center. Here there’s a row with just one pixel painted. Then the whole thing reverses— the number of pixels skipped goes down by one each time on the left, and up by two each time in the middle.', '04:19': 'Instructing Hedge to do this with a series of loops will work and is a perfectly fine solution. The main drawback is that this requires quite a bit of logic— knowing what to do in the middle, when to reverse the process, and exactly how to reverse it.', '04:34': 'So how might we approach this so that the logic remains consistent from start to finish? The key insight is to look at a grid as a series of concentric squares. Each square follows the same pattern— painted pixels in the corners, and unaltered pixels in between. So if we can figure out a way to paint one nested square, transition to the next, and repeat, we can paint them all.', '05:00': 'Painting the outermost one is easy. Start in a corner and paint that pixel. If we call the length of the painting n, fly forward n minus 1 spaces. Paint another pixel, and turn right. Now do the whole thing again… and again. Now move forward one less space, turn right, fly forward once, and Hedge will be in the next concentric square and ready to repeat the whole process. Each square is n minus 2 pixels smaller than the last in length and width, and we can follow this spiral pattern all the way to the center with a loop and a variable that tracks how far Hedge should fly.', '05:42': 'Is one of these methods better than the other? It really depends on what you value. The strength of the spiral is the simplicity of finding a pattern and reusing the same logic from start to finish. The advantage of the typewriter approach is that it’s a more generalized solution, meaning it can be adapted much more simply to fill in any pattern. For Ethic’s sake, either will do just fine.', '06:05': 'So here’s what happens.', '06:07': 'Hedge rapidly defaces all of the portraits. And within moments cries of anguish break out all over the forest.', '06:15': 'The garrison guarding the tower abandon their posts to calm the agitated people, and Ethic, Hedge, and Octavia slip through— and nearly slip into the depths of the gorge standing between them and the tower.'}"

Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward language and everyday experience to create lasting impact.', '00:43': 'Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection ""Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair"" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties of love and enchantment. In ""Poem VI,"" for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail into poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his collection ""All the Odes"" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, te vi, muerto.', '01:58': 'Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown by a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in a three volume poetry collection titled ""Residence on Earth."" Many of these poems were experimental and surreal, merging epic landscapes, supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to speak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the destruction of the Spanish Civil War.', '03:01': 'For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to revolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return to Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential ""Canto General."" The book attempts to retell the entire history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements.', '03:35': 'Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the rest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a military coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital a couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause of death as cancer.', '04:14': 'Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at protests and marches worldwide. Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments worth fighting for.'}"

Something was overloading the computer, and threatened to abort the landing.', '00:31': ""Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton held her breath. She'd led the team developing the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission had no room for error. But the nature of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software was working exactly as planned."", '00:48': 'Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, Hamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy, before taking a research position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer while developing software to support research into the new field of chaos theory.', '01:10': ""Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software for America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help sending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team."", '01:28': 'NASA looked to Draper and his group of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact digital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible for guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate without any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space.', '01:54': 'Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware and one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built the on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term “software engineering,"" was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, so every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time.', '02:24': ""But this kind of adaptable program was difficult to build, since early software could only process jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important jobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task a unique priority to ensure that each job occurred in the correct order and at the right time— regardless of any surprises."", '02:51': 'After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software could help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software communicated directly— and asynchronously— with a pilot.', '03:17': 'It was these fail safes that triggered the alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped the rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential on their journey home, but here it was using up vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage this. During the overload, the software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs to be processed— including the programs necessary for landing. The Priority Displays gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, Mission Control gave the order.', '03:59': 'The Apollo 11 landing was about the astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together as an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any crewed Apollo missions.', '04:26': 'After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses its unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs for systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements with the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual.

But right behind that wonder, I have to admit, is a bit of envy. I mean, nature can do it. Why can't we? Why can't we build tiny robots? Well, I'm not the only one to have this idea. In fact, in the last, oh, few years, researchers around the world have taken up the task of trying to build robots that are so small that they can't be seen. And what we're going to tell you about today is an effort at Cornell University and now at the University of Pennsylvania to try to build tiny robots."", '01:33': ""OK, so that's the goal.

But steal from what? Well, believe it or not, most of the technology you need to build a tiny robot already exists. The semiconductor industry has been getting better and better at making tinier and tinier devices, so at this point they could put something like a million transistors into the size of a package that is occupied by, say, a single-celled paramecium. And it's not just electronics. They can also build little sensors, LEDs, whole communication packages that are too small to be seen."", '02:26': ""So that's what we're going to do. We're going to steal that technology."", '02:30': ""Here's a robot."", '02:31': '(Laughter)', '02:33': ""Robot's got two parts, as it turns out.

It's such a beautiful little machine. It's incredibly intelligent, it's got great communication skills, and it's all in a package that you can hold in your hand. So we would like to be able to build something like this, only down at the cellular scale, the size of a paramecium."", '03:18': ""And here it is. This is our cell-sized smartphone. It even kind of looks like a smartphone, only it's about 10,000 times smaller. We call it an OWIC."", '03:29': '[Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits]', '03:32': ""OK, we're not advertisers, all right?"", '03:34': '(Laughter)', '03:37': ""But it's pretty cool all by itself. In fact, this OWIC has a number of parts. So up near the top, there are these cool little solar cells that you shine light on the device and it wakes up a little circuit that's there in the middle. And that circuit can drive a little tiny LED that can blink at you and allows the OWIC to communicate with you. So unlike your cell phone, the OWIC communicates with light, sort of like a tiny firefly."", '04:01': ""Now, one thing that's pretty cool about these OWICs is we don't make them one at a time, soldering all the pieces together. We make them in massive parallel. For example, about a million of these OWICs can fit on a single four-inch wafer. And just like your phone has different apps, you can have different kinds of OWICs. There can be ones that, say, measure voltage, some that measure temperature, or just have a little light that can blink at you to tell you that it's there."", '04:27': ""So that's pretty cool, these tiny little devices. And I'd like to tell you about them in a little more detail. But first, I have to tell you about something else. I'm going to tell you a few things about pennies that you might not know."", '04:40': ""So this one is a little bit older penny. It's got a picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the back. But the first thing you might not know, that if you zoom in, you'll find in the center of this thing you can actually see Abraham Lincoln, just like in the real Lincoln Memorial not so far from here. What I'm sure you don't know, that if you zoom in even further --"", '04:58': '(Laughter)', '05:00': ""you'll see that there's actually an OWIC on Abe Lincoln's chest."", '05:04': '(Laughter)', '05:06': 'But the cool thing is, you could stare at this all day long and you would never see it. It\'s invisible to the naked eye. These OWICs are so small, and we make them in such parallel fashion, that each OWIC costs actually less than a penny. In fact, the most expensive thing in this demo is that little sticker that says ""OWIC.""', '05:27': '(Laughter)', '05:32': 'That cost about eight cents.', '05:34': '(Laughter)', '05:37': ""Now, we're very excited about these things for all sorts of reasons. For example, we can use them as little tiny secure smart tags, more identifying than a fingerprint. We're actually putting them inside of other medical instruments to give other information, and even starting to think about putting them in the brain to listen to neurons one at a time."", '05:55': ""In fact, there's only one thing wrong with these OWICs: it's not a robot. It's just a head."", '06:01': '(Laughter)', '06:02': ""And I think we'll all agree that half a robot really isn't a robot at all. Without the legs, we've got basically nothing."", '06:12': ""MM: OK, so you need the legs, too, if you want to build a robot. Now, here it turns out you can't just steal some preexisting technology. If you want legs for your tiny robot, you need actuators, parts that move. They have to satisfy a lot of different requirements. They need to be low voltage. They need to be low power, too. But most importantly, they have to be small. If you want to build a cell-sized robot, you need cell-sized legs. Now, nobody knows how to build that. There was no preexisting technology that meets all of those demands. To make our legs for our tiny robots, we had to make something new."", '06:45': ""So here's what we built. This is one of our actuators, and I'm applying a voltage to it. When I do, you can see the actuator respond by curling up. Now, this might not look like much, but if we were to put a red blood cell up on the screen, it'd be about that big, so these are unbelievably tiny curls. They're unbelievably small, and yet this device can just bend and unbend, no problem, nothing breaks. So how do we do it? Well, the actuator is made from a layer of platinum just a dozen atoms or so thick. Now it turns out, if you take platinum and put it in water and apply a voltage to it, atoms from the water will attach or remove themselves from the surface of the platinum, depending on how much voltage you use. This creates a force, and you can use that force for voltage-controlled actuation. The key here was to make everything ultrathin. Then your actuator is flexible enough to bend to these small sizes without breaking, and it can use the forces that come about from just attaching or removing a single layer of atoms."", '07:36': ""Now, we don't have to build these one at a time, either. In fact, just like the OWICs, we can build them massively in parallel as well. So here's a couple thousand or so actuators, and all I'm doing is applying a voltage, and they all wave, looking like nothing more than the legs of a future robot army."", '07:52': '(Laughter)', '07:55': ""So now we've got the brains and we've got the brawn. We've got the smarts and the actuators. The OWICs are the brains. They give us sensors, they give us power supplies, and they give us a two-way communication system via light. The platinum layers are the muscle. They're what's going to move the robot around. Now we can take those two pieces, put them together and start to build our tiny, tiny robots. The first thing we wanted to build was something really simple. This robot walks around under user control. In the middle are some solar cells and some wiring attached to it. That's the OWIC. They're connected to a set of legs which have a platinum layer and these rigid panels that we put on top that tell the legs how to fold up, which shape they should take. The idea is that by shooting a laser at the different solar cells, you can choose which leg you want to move and make the robot walk around."", '08:40': ""Now, of course, we don't build those one at a time, either. We build them massively in parallel as well. We can build something like one million robots on a single four-inch wafer. So, for example, this image on the left, this is a chip, and this chip has something like 10,000 robots on it. Now, in our world, the macro world, this thing looks like it might be a new microprocessor or something. But if you take that chip and you put it under a microscope, what you're going to see are thousands and thousands of tiny robots."", '09:05': ""Now, these robots are still stuck down. They're still attached to the surface that we built them on. In order for them to walk around, we have to release them. We wanted to show you how we do that live, how we release the robot army, but the process involves highly dangerous chemicals, like, really nasty stuff, and we're like a mile from the White House right now? Yeah. They wouldn't let us do it. So --"", '09:28': '(Laughter)', '09:30': ""so we're going to show you a movie instead. (Laughs) What you're looking at here are the final stages of robot deployment. We're using chemicals to etch the substrate out from underneath the robots. When it dissolves, the robots are free to fold up into their final shapes. Now, you can see here, the yield's about 90 percent, so almost every one of those 10,000 robots we build, that's a robot that we can deploy and control later."", '09:53': ""And we can take those robots and we can put them places as well. So if you look at the movie on the left, that's some robots in water. I'm going to come along with a pipette, and I can vacuum them all up. Now when you inject the robots back out of that pipette, they're just fine. In fact, these robots are so small, they're small enough to pass through the thinnest hypodermic needle you can buy. Yeah, so if you wanted to, you could inject yourself full of robots."", '10:18': '(Laughter)', '10:20': ""I think they're into it."", '10:21': '(Laughter)', '10:24': ""On the right is a robot that we put in some pond water. I want you to wait for just one second. Ooop! You see that? That was no shark. That was a paramecium. So that's the world that these things live in."", '10:38': 'OK, so this is all well and good, but you might be wondering at this point, ""Well, do they walk?"" Right? That\'s what they\'re supposed to do. They better. So let\'s find out.', '10:48': ""So here's the robot and here are its solar cells in the middle. Those are those little rectangles. I want you to look at the solar cell closest to the top of the slide. See that little white dot? That's a laser spot. Now watch what happens when we start switching that laser between different solar cells on the robot. Off it goes!"", '11:08': '(Applause)', '11:11': 'Yeah!', '11:12': '(Applause)', '11:17': ""Off goes the robot marching around the microworld. Now, one of the things that's cool about this movie is: I'm actually piloting the robot in this movie. In fact, for six months, my job was to shoot lasers at tiny cell-sized robots to pilot them around the microworld. This was actually my job. As far as I could tell, that is the coolest job in the world."", '11:38': '(Laughter)', '11:39': ""It was just the feeling of total excitement, like you're doing the impossible. It's a feeling of wonder like that first time I looked through a microscope as a kid staring at that rotifer."", '11:49': ""Now, I'm a dad, I have a son of my own, and he's about three years old. But one day, he's going to look through a microscope like that one. And I often wonder: What is he going to see? Instead of just watching the microworld, we as humans can now build technology to shape it, to interact with it, to engineer it. In 30 years, when my son is my age, what will we do with that ability? Will microrobots live in our bloodstream, as common as bacteria? Will they live on our crops and get rid of pests? Will they tell us when we have infections, or will they fight cancer cell by cell?"", '12:29': ""PM: And one cool part is, you're going to be able to participate in this revolution. Ten years or so from now, when you buy your new iPhone 15x Moto or whatever it's called --"", '12:39': '(Laughter)', '12:40': ""it may come with a little jar with a few thousand tiny robots in it that you can control by an app on your cell phone.

https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_schulman_what_covid_19_means_for_the_future_of_commerce_capitalism_and_cash,"What COVID-19 means for the future of commerce, capitalism and cash","Capitalism needs an upgrade, says PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, and it starts with paying people enough to actually invest in their futures. He discusses why companies need to cultivate trust to recover and rebuild after the COVID-19 pandemic -- and how we can use this defining moment to create a more inclusive, ethical economy. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED business curator Corey Hajim and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded on May 19, 2020.)",00:49:09,49.15,253595,2020-05-29T19:47:17+00:00,"['capitalism', 'work', 'finance', 'money', 'business', 'economics']","['English', 'Español', 'Português brasileiro', 'Türkçe']",Dan Schulman,"President and CEO, PayPal","{'00:05': 'Corey Hajim: Today, our guest is Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal. When most of us think of PayPal, we think of buying something online or paying a friend back for a drink using Venmo. But PayPal has also become a major financial services player, often acting as an alternative to a traditional bank. During this pandemic, PayPal has supported small businesses around the world by providing loans, waiving fees and increasing cash back programs. It has also worked with the US government on its Paycheck Protection Program, as well as distributing stimulus checks. It has enabled an outpouring of generosity online as well. The trend towards digital payments, or what we might now want to think of as ""contactless payments,"" has massively accelerated, and it\'s changing forever how we think about commerce. So I\'m really excited to have Dan here with us. Thank you so much, Dan.', '01:07': 'Dan Schulman: Thanks for having me, Corey. Pleasure to be here with you.', '01:11': ""CH: Glad to see you. So let's dive right in. Within a few months of this pandemic's arrival, more than 30 million people have filed for unemployment in the United States alone. These are certainly unusual circumstances, but it seems clear we were running very close to the edge, and now so many businesses and their employees are facing huge financial challenges. How worried are you?"", '01:41': ""DS: Well, I think the crisis has exposed three things. Obviously, it's a health crisis for so many people. Second thing is, that health crisis has ricocheted, and the world is now in an economic crisis. And the third crisis that we don't talk so much about but I think is impacting the way that we're going to live our lives going forward is: this is a psychological crisis as well. People are reexamining their place in the world, what's happening in the world, how they're going to live their lives, both in the pandemic and postpandemic. And so I think this is something that each of those phases will need to be dealt with."", '02:32': ""But you said this, and I completely agree with you: there was an economic crisis happening well before the pandemic exposed this. It's kind of like the water level came down and exposed what was already there. You had, for instance, in the US, 185 million adults in the US struggling to make ends meet at the end of the month. You have over 70 million adults that are really outside of the financial system, spending over 140 billion dollars on high interest rates, unnecessary fees and struggling as well. And so I think what this has really done -- because you can't ignore 20, 25 percent unemployment rates -- it's exposed this crisis and forced a lot of people into, maybe, actions that they might not have taken without this crisis happening."", '03:39': ""CH: Yeah, I think that's right. There are so many challenges and so many opportunities, and I think you've spoken of this opportunity of digital transactions being helpful to people, and obviously the trend, as you've said, has massively accelerated and pushed us into this world even further. So I'm curious: What does the world look like without cash? Or less cash? What are the advantages and what are the challenges of making that transition?"", '04:11': ""DS: I think some of the trends that are emerging coming out of this pandemic or coming into it and as we look forward is, clearly, this has been a discontinuous change in the trend line as we move from physical to digital. I think we've accelerated many forms of digital capabilities by three to five years. And that can be from digital payments to telemedicine to really changing the face of retail and how we think about retailing, changing the face of entertainment, even changing the way governments think about managing and moving money and really thinking about digital currencies going forward. And so I think there are a tremendous number of changes that will occur during this pandemic and coming out of it. Digital payments is obviously one of the big ones that will happen. I mean, cash has been around for quite some time, thousands of years. I would not be so bold as to predict its full demise. Many people have been wrong doing that. But there is no question right now that you will see an acceleration of the demise of cash. Last year, you had over 18 trillion dollars of cash spent at retail. Eighty-five percent of the world's transactions today are done in cash still. But the really big change right now towards digital payments, and that's both the advent and the acceleration of commerce that's happening, as well as the shift to in-store contactless payments, as you said, and the real impetus for that is health reasons. People do not want to hand over money. They do not want to touch screens. They don't want to pick up a pen and sign at the point of sale. And so there is a demand for contactless payments and digital payments to keep social distancing requirements in place, to protect the health of cashiers, to protect the health of consumers. And I think we are going to see, we are already seeing in our business, a surge in digital payments across the world."", '06:52': ""CH: It seems like a great opportunity, but how do we make sure that this transition is inclusive? I mean, you've talked about how so many people are underserved by the traditional banking industry. How do we make sure that those people have that opportunity? And it feels like a smartphone becomes an essential item. How do we address that?"", '07:16': ""DS: Yeah. I do think that a mobile is really a key to unlocking this. I've often said that, really, one of the big moon shots for the financial services industry is this idea of not just financial inclusion. Most people define financial inclusion by somebody having access to a bank account, but just having access to a bank account is not nearly enough. I think what we need to aim for is how do we think about financial health? How do we make sure that people have the ability to have some wherewithal to create savings to withstand some kind of financial shock to the system? I do think that mobile phones will be the way that this occurs and will be very inclusive going forward."", '08:13': ""There are going to be something like six billion smartphones in the world over the next several years. The cost of a smartphone is plummeting. I think in India now you can buy a smartphone for under 25 dollars. So you're going to have ubiquity of smartphones across the world, and, in fact, what's very interesting is, in lower-income populations, there is a greater penetration of smartphones than in higher income because the smartphone is the only device that somebody has. Higher-income individuals may have desktops or iPads, that kind of thing, but lower income can afford one device, and they choose it to be a smartphone because they can get and live their life through that one device."", '09:04': ""And think about that one device. Really, you have all the power of a bank branch in the palm of your hands. And when you can start to create distribution of services, financial services, through a smartphone, you then are able to manage and move money in ways that we couldn't do traditionally."", '09:30': ""In the physical world, if you get a check, you need to then go to a cash checking place to cash it. You stand in line for 30 minutes. They then charge you anywhere between two and five percent to just change the format of currency from a check to cash. And then you have cash and you want to pay a bill. You need to stand in line again at a bill pay, and then you have to pay maybe 10 dollars for an individual bill as a fee. If you do that via a smartphone, I believe that not only do you save a tremendous amount of time, because if you're outside the financial system, managing and moving money is practically a part-time job to go and do that, so not only do you save time and return time to individuals, but you can cut the cost of transactions by anywhere between 50 and 75 percent. And remember that $140 billion number that I gave you? And that's just in the US. Imagine if you could cut that in half and return that to the most vulnerable populations that need it most. So I think there's tremendous promise in the use of technology to help provide both inclusion and make sure there aren't digital haves and have-nots, but also to start on this journey towards financial health."", '10:58': ""CH: Yeah, I think a lot of people don't realize that you don't need a bank account or even a credit card to open a PayPal account, which is super-interesting. I mean, do you see a time where traditional banks don't exist or at least play a much smaller role in the financial services industry?"", '11:18': ""DS: Well, I think the entire financial services industry is evolving right now, and so I think banks will always play a role, or as far into the future as I can see, but it will evolve. I mean, think about basic credit cards. Today, you think about a credit card, and you think about it predominantly as a form factor, something that you pull out of your pocket. Sometimes there's status associated with what you're pulling out of your pocket, depending on the color of that credit card. But really I think those form factors start to go away and become embedded in digital wallets. So credit will always be an important element."", '12:07': ""You know, most people in the world, it isn't that their cash outlays exceed their cash intake. It's just that they're not evenly distributed. So there are times where your cash outflows exceed your cash intake, and there, you need some form of credit to make up that difference. And so I think forms of credit will always be an important element. But the way that you extend credit will change going forward, the way that you think about scoring people in terms of can they handle credit. You know, traditionally, in more developed countries, you use what's called FICO scores or bureau scores, but those ignore so many of the financial transactions that people who are outside the financial system do, like paying rent or paying their bills on time. And with the data and information and machine learning around that -- and we need to be careful that there aren't biases built into those algorithms -- we can start to do things that could never be done before."", '13:20': ""I'll just give you one quick example. We're one of the largest providers of working capital to small businesses in the world. We're probably one of the top five in the United States. So we've done over 14, 15 billion dollars of lending of working capital to small businesses. Seventy percent of that goes to the 30 percent of counties where 10 or more banks have closed branches. And where do banks close branches? Banks close branches in neighborhoods where the median income is below the national average, which makes sense because for a branch to be profitable, they need a certain amount of deposits for that branch to actually be profitable. And so, in lower income neighborhoods, branches are starting to close. So why are 70 percent of our loans in those lower income neighborhoods? It's because we do machine learning. We don't even look at FICO scores or bureau scores. We look at a number of different data elements. And so we can lend into those lower income neighborhoods where nobody else can, and when we do that, the average sale of a small business goes up by 22 percent. And imagine the impact that has on communities and neighborhoods where they can finally get the working capital to expand those small businesses. And I think that's a perfect example of the promise of what technology and financial services married together can do."", '14:55': ""CH: I think it's so interesting. I'm curious. The tech industry has been criticized for amassing power over society, not that the banking industry isn't criticized. But what do you say about people who might be worried about tech companies taking on even more influence and control over what's happening in their lives?"", '15:19': ""DS: Yeah. Well, I think what's so important for any company and tech companies is to respect the boundaries in terms of what consumers expect from a company that serves them. I think the most important brand attribute that a company can have is trust, and trust comes from the understanding that a company respects your privacy and will not sell your data or information, that it can perform transactions in a secure manner so that your transactions are protected. And I think those are kind of foundational, and I think any company needs to respect that. They need to assure that consumers have the privacy that they desire and the safety and security that is required to serve them the right way."", '16:31': ""CH: And obviously, you've gained a lot of trust with the US government. Maybe we could talk a little bit about how you've been working with them to distribute some money through the Paycheck Protection Program. And I was curious, I've been reading about it, and it sounds like 30 million-ish small businesses in the United States are able to get those funds, but only six million have received the loans. What do you think's happened?"", '17:01': 'DS: Yep. Well, I think initially, the government -- and I give them a lot of credit -- they responded quite quickly with a 3 trillion dollar stimulus package. These are massive numbers that were happening in very condensed time frames. We were working with various agencies, very closely with the Treasury Department, in terms of distribution of the stimulus. And they were working literally night and day on this. The Small Business Administration was working night and day. But these are volumes that have never been seen before running through these systems, and the first tranche of those loans was very difficult. There were a lot of technical difficulties in getting those out to small businesses. And that first tranche was not enough, and it was quickly used, and there are still a host of small businesses that needed money.', '18:14': ""The second tranche that came out is still actually in effect. It has not been used up, and we are continuing to lend on that. We've been able to lend to some 50,000 small businesses. We've lent out about 1.7 billion dollars, and our loan size, which really I'm proud of, is about 31,000 dollars. The average that a bank does is between 100 and 125,000 dollars. So we are lending to these true small businesses on Main Street, and I'm proud that we've been able to go do that, and I think we should give credit to the US government and governments around the world that are taking this quite seriously and putting a tremendous amount, a percentage of their GDP, towards the rescue of small businesses and towards trying to take care of consumers that find themselves in really difficult straits right now."", '19:21': ""And we've been trying to, instead of people mailing out checks, which is ridiculous in today's world -- people aren't living where they think they're going to be living, they're with their parents or with friends or in a different location, and mailing a check and then having to take a check and go somewhere, which you can't even go if you're sheltered in place, to cash it, doing that electronically just makes a ton more sense -- and we've been working with the IRS and Treasury and other government agencies to distribute that electronically."", '19:53': ""CH: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. It's a massive, massive project for all of us. Whitney is here with some questions from our community."", '20:04': 'DS: Hello, Whitney.', '20:06': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello Dan. How are you? So the community has some interesting questions following up on what you were talking about earlier about security. We have a question from Marc -- and I apologize in advance if I mispronounce your name, Marc -- Marc Vanlerberghe: ""The move to digital cash could be one more step towards creating the perfect surveillance state. How do we avoid this from happening?""', '20:27': ""DS: Yeah, well, this is what I was talking about, Marc, before. I mean, I think this idea of trust is incredibly important. I think the only companies that will be successful -- and I think we hold a lot of this in our own hands as consumers, by the way; we need to be aware of data and information that we're giving and to what companies we're doing that with -- but I think the companies that will be successful are those that have a high degree of trust, and trust happens by protecting your privacy but also very much assuring that your transactions in a digital world are safe and secure. I mean, the idea of cybersecurity has always been important, but is ever more important as we move from physical to digital, and that's where large data sets are important, because a consumer's identity is stolen every two seconds. Every two seconds, some consumer has their identity stolen. And so we have to be, for instance, we have to be sure that even when you sign in with your credentials, they're actually real credentials. We have to look at 30 to 100 different elements of that transaction to make sure it's really you before we let that money out of your account. And so there is a combination of making sure you have enough data to protect somebody but also assure that your privacy is held sacrosanct, and I think that is a balancing act and one that needs to happen in order for us to do this successfully."", '22:19': 'WPR: Great, and actually sort of going from digital cash to digital currency, we have another question from Simone Ross in our community about the opportunity that exists for digital currency. She mentioned that PayPal pulled out of Libra. What would it take for a truly inclusive digital currency to take hold here?', '22:39': ""DS: Yeah. I think there is a tremendous amount of promise as we think about digital currencies. Our pulling out of Libra had nothing to do with our firm conviction that blockchain and other forms of maybe stable coin currencies are extremely important and can be very, very helpful, especially in different parts of the world. As we think about stability in different parts of the world where currencies can fluctuate up and down, to have a more stable currency where somebody can know, if they have that, that it's going to be worth x amount, and that they can transact, either with other individuals around the world or, importantly, at merchants around the world. And we are looking at all forms of digital currencies right now, working hand in hand with a number of different governments, and I think we should all think about how technology is going to evolve and how currencies will evolve as a result of that. And I think this crisis has really opened the eyes of many governments around the world as to the need for different tool sets to create stimulus and to efficiently and quickly and effectively distribute funds to their citizens."", '24:23': 'WPR: Great. Well, I\'ll be back shortly with more questions, and I\'d just love to remind the community that you can ask questions on the ""Ask question"" feature. Be sure to use the pull-down tab to select Episode 2, so those questions come. Thank you.', '24:36': 'DS: Thanks, Whitney.', '24:37': ""CH: Thanks, Whitney. Dan, I want to go back to something we touched on in the beginning about financial wellness. PayPal has done something unique in terms of calculating how much to pay people and how much you should spend on benefits. Traditionally, wages are set by the market, but you've found that paying as much or even more than other companies wasn't always enough. Can you tell us about that moment?"", '25:07': 'DS: Yeah. So I said, kind of, in our opening, in one of my opening statements, that two-thirds of Americans struggle to make ends meet at the end of the month. They are financially stressed, and it kind of wreaks havoc in their life. I did a study to look at PayPal employees. We did a research study, and I did it because I thought I was going to get back this great information that I was going to talk about at an employee meeting about how well we pay, because we pay, to your point, at or above market in every single location around the world. And what I found is, unfortunately, like the rest of the world, even though we paid at market or above market, 60 percent of our operations personnel, our entry-level employees, our hourly workers, face the same thing. They struggle to make ends meet. And that was simply unacceptable for me.', '26:20': 'I think the world is changing in terms of the responsibility of corporations, the responsibility of CEOs. We have a lot of different stakeholders that we try to satisfy, from regulators to shareholders to customers to employees. But I think the number one responsibility that we have is the health -- financial health -- of our employees, because nothing could be more important to a company than to have financially secure, passionate employees working for you, because nobody is going to serve customers better than employees who feel a part of something and feel financially secure and glad to be a part of that company.', '27:09': 'And so then the real question becomes: How do you measure that? Because a lot of people think about living wages or a minimum wage. And we thought that was insufficient, and we came up with a measurement we called ""net disposable income,"" which is, basically: After you pay taxes and your basically essential living expenses, how much money do you have left over for discretionary things or to save? And here\'s the really unfortunate thing -- and I\'m not proud of this, but remember, we were paying at market or above, so I thought the market would take care of this, right, by doing that -- we found that for that population, they had four to six percent NDI, net disposable income, after paying taxes and essential living expenses. That is not enough. You are going to struggle to make ends meet. And by the way, NDI changes location to location to location around the globe, right? There\'s a different NDI in Manila, a different NDI in Omaha, Nebraska, than there is in New York City, etc. And so we basically said to ourselves, we need to take NDI to 20 percent. Because at 20 percent -- and that\'s a huge shift, from four to six to 20 percent -- but at 20 percent, you actually have the ability to save and to put money away and to take care of discretionary expenses.', '28:46': 'And so we did a pretty massive reorientation of our compensation systems. We lowered the cost of benefits by 58 percent, because benefits are like a regressive tax, you pay the same amount no matter what your salary is. And so we had a lot of employees who weren\'t taking health care benefits, because it cost too much to be able to do that. So we lowered it by 58 percent. We made every single employee of PayPal a shareholder and an owner of the business, and we gave them pretty big grants so that they could be a part of the success of PayPal going forward. We raised salaries where we needed to go and do that. And then we wrapped all of that into a financial education program, because people had never gotten equity before, they were trying to think through, ""How do I save now that I\'ve got incremental dollars to go and do that?"" And that cost us quite a bit of money to go and do that, but I really feel, just like how we spend a lot of money to take care of customers, as you mentioned up front, in COVID-19, that companies need to stand for more than just making money, for more than just maximizing our profits next quarter. I firmly, firmly believe that the costs associated with taking care of our employees, taking care of our customers, will benefit us in the long run multiplefold over the costs associated with doing that. And we\'re already beginning to see some of the impact of that.', '30:33': ""And so, I think every CEO, every company, needs to really now start to think about, especially maybe as a result of this crisis, but as I mentioned, we had a crisis before this, how do we put our employees first, take care of them? Because if you do that, you'll take care of customers, and if you take care of customers, you'll take of shareholders, inevitably. And so this has been a huge part of it about for the last year or so."", '31:10': ""CH: It's so interesting, and it brings up so many questions, I think, for me and probably our community as well. I mean, PayPal is a hugely profitable tech business, huge free cash flow and big margins. Do you think this model is something that every company can do, whether it's a tech company, a manufacture, a meatpacking business? I mean, is this what everyone should be focused on?"", '31:42': ""DS: Well, I think that -- and I don't want to moralize or tell other companies what they should do -- but to me, I think everyone should understand the financial health of their employees. That's a baseline thing to go do. What you do post-that is up to maybe your financial strength as a company or where you put your order of priorities. But what I've found is, I thought the market could tell you that, and this is why I say, in many ways -- you know, I'm a big believer in capitalism. I think it's, in many ways, the best economic system that I know of. But, like everything, it needs an upgrade. It needs tuning, and at least for these vulnerable populations, just because you pay at market doesn't mean that they have financial health or financial wellness. And I think everyone should know whether or not their employees have the wherewithal to be able to save to withstand financial shocks, and then really understand, like, what can you do about it? I think this NDI measure is a really interesting one. It takes some time to go do it, because you have to be quite thorough and you have to really understand living expenses by location and what tax jurisdictions there are. But you need to create an NDI that's to a certain level where people aren't struggling to make ends meet. Because if people are struggling to make ends meet, they are not as productive at work. They're worried about, like, what am I going to do with my kids? My kid just got sick. I don't have health insurance. I think there's a spiral that occurs. You think you're actually saving money by paying less, but the reality is, at least in my belief system, you take care of your employees, and other things naturally flow from that. They are more productive. They love being a part of that company. They take care of customers better. And all of those things inevitably accrue to the benefit of a company in terms of how it's trying to serve its ultimate end market. But it starts with your employees."", '34:24': 'CH: So obviously you believe in this ""capitalism needs an upgrade,"" and I think NDI is something so many companies should adopt. But do you think this happens through benevolent corporate activity? I\'m channeling my inner Bernie Bro here, but I think a lot of people would be skeptical that we should trust companies to do better at this point. Should the government step in to raise minimum wages, do other things to protect workers in a more structured way?', '34:56': ""DS: Look, I think the government clearly has a role to play, and I think the private and public sectors need to work closer together to address so many of the issues that we face in our societies across the world, whether that be income inequality, environmental issues, health, protections, that kind of thing, privacy. But the way that I think about this is, it's very difficult for governments to regulate around this, because there are so many different ways of thinking about it."", '35:44': ""If I were another CEO, and this is like, it's actually in your best interest to go and do this because it's a competitive advantage. Like, we attract, I think, some of the best talent in the world to PayPal, because we have a mission that people believe in, that we actually are trying to make some sort of positive difference. I'm not saying we're the be-all and end-all, but I don't think people should shirk their responsibilities of at least making a small difference going forward. If enough companies did that, if enough governments did that, it would make a real difference in the world. And then the second thing is, you have to have values that support that. And those values are incredibly important. Those values should be all about inclusion. They should be about having a diverse workforce. They should be about financial wellness. And when you do that, and you attract the very best talent, then by definition, I think the single biggest competitive advantage for any company is their workforce. Strategies are great. A whole number of things are great. You have a great workforce that's passionate about what they're doing and is financially secure, and they will do amazing things. And I think it's that kind of competitive advantage that will spur companies. So there needs to be a set of CEOs and companies that start to move in this direction, and I believe you're beginning to see more do this. And once that happens, it starts to tip everything, and I think more and more need to do it to maintain their competitive positioning. And that may seem like a self-serving way why people are doing it, but honestly, I don't care whether they're doing it out of the goodness of their heart or they're doing it because it's competitively a disadvantage if they don't. Creating financial health for our employees is the goal, and we've got to get that done."", '38:07': ""CH: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you think of this as a win-win, but it also sounds like you're willing to maybe think about your employees first and sell it to your shareholders later. Whitney is -- oh sorry, go ahead."", '38:24': 'DS: No, no, no -- I was just going to say, I actually do believe that, and I think the idea of a multistakeholder capitalism, that is a time for today, and we cannot just think that we have one stakeholder that we need to satisfy. We live in our communities, we live in this world. To have people struggling day in and day out is not good for any company, and ... We can only do x amount, but we can actually create financial health for our employees, and we should.', '39:10': 'WPR: Great. So we have so many questions coming in from the community. One here is from Lara Pearson, basically about whether PayPal would consider become a B Corporation. ""Are you familiar with the B Corp movement, environmentally and socially responsible, multiple-bottom-line for profits? Presuming so, has PayPal considered or would it consider becoming a certified B Corporation?""', '39:30': ""DS: Yep. I'm familiar with B Corp. We have no intention to move to becoming a B Corporation. I think the values and what we are trying to do are very aligned with assuring a multistakeholder point of view, but what I really want is for this to be a movement across major corporations across the world. And you're not going to have major corporations around the world moving into B Corp. There's a lot of other side issues involved with being a B Corporation as opposed to just a publicly listed company, and so that's going to be a long way before that happens. And so what I'm really trying to do is encourage and demonstrate that being multistakeholder, that putting employees first, creates competitive advantage. And I think I'm not the only CEO who's feeling that, by the way. I think people like Satya Nadella from Microsoft are doing a great job, Marc Benioff from Salesforce. I could go through quite a list of names. But the list is not long enough yet, but I think there's some quite important names and individuals around the world who are now talking about multistakeholder capitalism, and I think that's an important element as we think about our economies and way of life looking forward."", '41:27': 'WPR: And there was so much interest also in your net disposable income program and a lot of questions around that, and one which I think is along these same lines from Juan Enriquez asking about a rational way to address extreme income disparities. And perhaps you could expand beyond this program, just sort of ways that we might think about this in a smarter way moving forward.', '41:49': ""DS: Yeah. Well, there's no easy solution, or it would have been done. So I think there are a couple things that I think about that may not fully address extreme income disparities. Again, I try to think pragmatically about these things, and, like, what can we really do to start to address this? And again, I think about, if we could take one step and then another step, then you're starting your journey, and without getting overwhelmed by how far away the end state is. So one, I think companies need to take care of their employees, and I think that will immediately help to address some of these income disparities. Number two, I do think that, ironically, if you have less money, it costs you more to manage and move it, which, think about that: the less money you have, if you're outside the financial system, the more you spend to manage and move your money."", '43:08': ""And I think that technology is at least a foundational way for us to think about how do we cut the basic costs of managing and moving money by 50 to 70 percent, like [check-cashing], sending remittances, which are such a huge, important part of the world's economy. You know, you do it a traditional way, you go into a store and send the remittance to another store and somebody goes and picks it up. First of all, incredibly time-consuming, and it can cost between eight and 12 percent of that remittance amount that you're sending. So if you're sending a hundred dollars, the recipient who so desperately needs it is getting 88 to 90 dollars. If you do that electronically, digital wallet to digital wallet, that can be like three percent, so you can get 97 dollars from that. And so I think there are ways of addressing the costs. As I mentioned, there is so much money spent on unnecessary fees and high interest rates, and if we can drop that by 20 percent, 30 percent, the amount of money we can return to vulnerable populations is quite large and will start to make a difference."", '44:35': 'WPR: That\'s great. We have a ton of questions from the audience, just one more before we turn things back over to Corey with her final questions. This one is from Anna Tunkel, which is just, I think, as we are rounding to the end of the interview here, ""What are you most optimistic about, and what do you see as the biggest opportunities for \'Building Back Better\' after COVID?""', '44:58': ""DS: Well, I mean, one thing I'm actually optimistic about -- and I've always been a believer in the human spirit and the power of an individual to make a difference. I know that sounds very cliché, but I truly believe it, and I think every one of us can make a difference. But here's what I'm seeing. I'm beginning to see that at a much larger scale than I've ever seen before. You know, we have different platforms, either the PayPal platform or the Venmo platform, Venmo here in the US, PayPal across the world. The amount of giving that's happening through those platforms, whether it be to local businesses, to artists, to musicians, to bartenders, to places of worship, to schools, to NGOs, to charities has exploded on the platform, exploded. We have helped to raise on the PayPal platform since COVID-19 struck 2.8 billion dollars for NGOs and charities -- 2.8 billion. That's incredible, the amount of generosity that is pouring out from the global community around this. And we're just seeing people randomly pay it forward. Somebody gives 20 dollars to a bartender, and that bartender takes 10 dollars of that and gives it to somebody else. And we're watching that over our platform, and that gives me a sense of optimism."", '46:46': ""I also feel like this period of time has exposed a number of things that were happening but were invisible, and I think when things become visible, that's when you can start to address them, and I think there's a lot of attention on some issues that should have had attention before, but vulnerable populations don't have as loud a voice as others, and now that voice is being heard, because you can't ignore it. And hopefully, that will create progress against some of these structural inequalities that have been there for a long time."", '47:35': ""WPR: That's wonderful. And there's so much interest online. You have some other questions to ask as well."", '47:44': ""CH: So I think we have one more from our community from Jacqueline Ashby. Anna sort of stole my last question, which was to restore our faith in humanity. But, there's so much interest coming in about NDI. Is there a way for people to learn more, for you to share your study and your methodology?"", '48:05': ""DS: Happy to do so. There is nothing proprietary about it. We would love for this to be -- look, and this may not be the be-all and end-all measurement. It's the best one we could come up with, but if working within the community, we can evolve it and think about maybe things that it missed or maybe things that could be done better, that would be fantastic. I don't know the best way of doing that. I'll leave that to Corey and Whitney to help me think that through, but of course we'd be willing to share it. There is nothing about that that I don't want to share."", '48:48': 'CH: Sounds like a good TED Talk. Thank you so much, Dan. This has been a super-interesting conversation. I think we could talk for another hour, but thank you so much for being here.', '49:03': 'DS: Thank you, Corey. Thank you, Whitney. Thank you, everybody.', '49:06': 'WPR: Thank you, Dan. Thank you.'}"
https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_trombley_the_beauty_and_complexity_of_finding_common_ground,The beauty and complexity of finding common ground,"How can we disagree with one another, respectfully and productively? In this thoughtful talk, team builder Matt Trombley reflects on ""agonism"" -- the tendency to take a rigid stance on issues -- and shares why finding aspects of agreement can be the first step in resolving conflict. ""When you can find even the smallest bit of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person,"" he says.",00:13:52,13.866666666666667,257262,2020-06-26T14:49:40+00:00,"['humanity', 'community', 'communication', 'personal growth', 'relationships']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro', 'Română', 'Ελληνικά', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)']",Matt Trombley,"Maven, teacher, team builder","{'00:05': 'So our story started several years ago, when my wife and I got a complaint letter in the mail from an anonymous neighbor.', '00:13': '(Laughter)', '00:15': ""I'll never forget the way my wife transformed before my eyes from this graceful, peaceful, sweet woman into just an angry mother grizzly bear whose cubs needed to be protected. It was intense. So here's what happened."", '00:32': ""This is our family. This is my wife and I and our five awesome kids. We're pretty loud, we're pretty rambunctious, we're us. You'll notice, though, that two of our children look a little different than Mary and I, and that's because they came to us through adoption. Our neighbor, though, saw two different-looking children playing outside of our house every day and came to the conclusion that we must have been running an illegal day care out of our home."", '00:58': '(Murmuring)', '01:02': ""We were really angry to have our children stereotyped like that, but I know that's a relatively minor example of racial profiling. But isn't it sometimes what we all tend to do with people who think differently, or believe differently or maybe even vote differently? Instead of engaging as true neighbors, we keep our distance and our actions towards those are guided by who we think sees the world as we do or who we think doesn't."", '01:33': 'See, what my neighbor suffered from is a condition called agonism. And sometimes we all suffer from the same condition. It\'s not a medical condition, but it is contagious. So let\'s talk a little bit about what agonism is. My favorite definition of agonism is taking a warlike stance in contexts that are not literally war. Agonism comes from the same Greek root word ""agon"" from which we get ""agony."" How very appropriate. We all tend to show symptoms of agonism when we hold on to two deeply held beliefs, first identified by author Rick Warren. The first one is that if love someone, we must agree with all they do or believe. And the second is the inverse, that if we disagree with someone, it must mean that we fear or we hate them.', '02:30': ""Not sure we really recognize the agony this way of thinking brings to us, when our relationships die because we think we have to agree or disagree no matter what. Think about the conversations we've had around Brexit, or Hong Kong, maybe Israeli settlements or perhaps impeachment. I bet we could all think of at least one personal relationship that's been strained or maybe even ended because of these topics, or tragically, over a topic much more trivial than those. The cure for agonism is not out of reach. The question is how."", '03:11': 'So might I suggest two strategies that my experience has taught me to start with. First, cultivate common ground, which means focusing on what we share. I want you to know I\'m using my words very, very deliberately. By ""cultivate,"" I mean we have to intentionally work to find common ground with someone. Just like a farmer works to cultivate the soil. And common ground is a common term, so let me at least explain what I don\'t mean, which is I don\'t mean by common ground that we were exact, or that we totally agree and approve. All I mean is that we find one unifying thing that we can have in a relationship in common with another person.', '03:56': ""You know, sometimes that one thing is hard to find. So I'd like to share a personal story, but before I do, let me tell you a little bit more about myself. I'm Caucasian, cisgender male, middle class, evangelical Christian. And I know, as soon as some of those words came out of my mouth, some of you had some perceptions about me. And it's OK, I know that not all those perceptions are positive. But for those who share my faith, know that I'm about to cut across the grain. And you may tune me out as well. So as we go, if you're having a hard time hearing me, I just gently ask that you reflect and see if you're buying into agonism. If you're rejecting me simply because you think you see the world differently than I do, because isn't that what we're here talking about? Alright, ready?"", '04:48': 'So I\'ve been thinking a lot about how to find common ground in the area of gender fluidity, as an evangelical Christian. For Christians like me, we believe that God created us man and woman. So what do I do? Do I throw up my hands and say, ""I can\'t have a relationship with anybody who is transgender or LGBTQIA?"" No. That would be giving into agonism.', '05:16': 'So I started looking at the foundational aspects of my faith, the first of which is that of the three billion genes that make us human -- and by the way, we share 99.9 percent of those genes -- that I believe those three billion genes are the result of an intelligent designer. And that immediately gives me common ground with anybody. What it also gives me ... is the belief that each and every one of us have been given the right to life by that same intelligent designer.', '05:55': ""I dug deeper though. I found that my faith didn't teach me to start relationships by arguing with somebody until they believed what I believed, or I convinced them. No, it taught me to start relationships by loving them as a coequal member of the human race. Honestly though, some who share my faith draw a line and refuse to address somebody by their preferred gender pronoun. But isn't that believing the lie that in order for me to honor you, I have to give up what I believe?"", '06:30': ""Come back in time with me -- let's say it's 20 years ago, and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep. And you open the door. Would you address him as Muhammad Ali or his former name of Cassius Clay? I'm guessing that most of you would say Muhammad Ali. And I'm also guessing that most of you wouldn't think we'd have to immediately convert to Islam, just by using his name. To honor him would cost me, would cost any of us absolutely nothing, and it would give us the common ground to have a relationship. And it's the relationship that cures agonism, not giving up what we believe."", '07:13': ""So for me to honor my faith, it means rejecting these rigid symptoms of agonism. Meaning, I can and I will love you. I can and I will accept you, and I don't have to buy into the lie that if I do these things, I have to give up what I believe or chose to fear and hate you. Because I'm focusing on what we have in common."", '07:39': 'When you can find even the smallest bit of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand just the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person.', '07:58': 'Our second strategy gives us room to (Inhales) breathe. To pause. To calm down. To have the kind of relationships that cure agonism. And how to keep those relationships alive. Our second strategy is to exchange extravagant grace.', '08:22': '(Laughs)', '08:24': ""Once again, I'm not mincing words -- by grace, I don't mean we should all go sign up for ballet, that would be weird."", '08:30': '(Laughter)', '08:31': 'What I mean is not canceling everything over one mistake. Even if that mistake personally offended you. Maybe even deeply. Perhaps Holocaust survivor Corrie ten Boom put it best when she said, ""To forgive is to set a prisoner free, only to realize that prisoner was me."" My faith teaches me that we humans will never be perfect, myself very much included. So we need the grace of a savior, who for me is Jesus. And while I define grace in the context of my faith, I know there\'s a lot of other people who have defined it differently and in different ways. One of my favorites is radio broadcaster Oswald Hoffmann, who said, ""Grace is the love that loves the unlovely and the unlovable."" And I just love that picture of grace. Because I know I am, and maybe a lot of you can think of a time when we\'re just pretty dadgum unlovable.', '09:41': 'So it would be the height of hypocrisy, dare I say repulsive to my faith, for me to accept the unconditional, unqualified grace and love from God and then turn around and put one precondition on the love I give you. What in the world would I be thinking? And by extravagant, I mean over the top, not just checking a box. We can all remember when we were kids and our parents forced us to apologize to somebody and we walked up to them and said, (Angrily) ""I\'m sorry."" We just got it over with, right? That\'s not what we\'re talking about. What we\'re talking about is not having to give someone grace but choosing to and wanting to. That\'s how we exchange extravagant grace.', '10:36': ""Listen, I know this can sound really, really theoretical. So I'd like to tell you about a hero of mine. A hero of grace. It's 2014. In Iran. And the mother of a murdered son is in a public square. The man who murdered her son is also in that square, by a gallows, on a chair of some kind, a noose around his neck and a blindfold over his eyes. Samereh Alinejad had been given the sole right under the laws of her country to either pardon this man or initiate his execution. Put another way, she could pardon him or literally push that chair out from underneath his feet."", '11:30': '(Exhales)', '11:32': ""I just ... I can't picture the agony going through both Samereh and this man at the time. Samereh with her choice to make, and this man, in the account that I read, was just weeping, just begging for forgiveness. And Samereh had a choice. And she chose in that moment to walk up to this man and to slap him right across the face. And that signaled her pardon. It gets better."", '12:03': 'Right afterwards, somebody asked her, they interviewed her, and she was quoted as saying, ""I felt as if rage vanished from within my heart and the blood in my veins began to flow again."" Isn\'t that incredible? I mean, what a picture of grace, what a hero of grace. And there\'s a lesson in there for all of us. That as theologian John Piper said, ""Grace is power, not just pardon."" And if you think about it, grace is the gift we give someone else in a relationship that says our relationship is way more important than the things that separate us. And if you really think about it some more, we all have the power to execute in our relationships, or to pardon.', '12:59': 'We never did find out the identity of our anonymous neighbor.', '13:03': '(Laughter)', '13:05': 'But if we did, I\'d hope we\'d simply say, ""Can we have coffee?"" And maybe there\'s somebody you need to have coffee with and find your common ground with them. Or maybe there\'s somebody you\'re in a relationship with and you need to exchange extravagant grace. Maybe go first.', '13:25': 'These two strategies have taught me how to exchange extravagant grace in my relationships and to enjoy the beautiful design of my neighbors. I want to continue to choose relationships over agonism. Will you choose to join me?', '13:44': 'Thank you.', '13:45': '(Applause)'}"

But for this to happen, we need technologies that allow cars to respond faster than humans, we need algorithms that can drive better than humans and we need cameras that can see more than humans can see.', '00:24': ""For example, imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn, and there's an oncoming car or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street. Fortunately, our future car will have this superpower, a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards."", '00:42': ""For the past few years as a PhD student in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, I've been working on a camera that can do just this -- a camera that can image objects hidden around corners or blocked from direct line of sight."", '00:55': ""So let me give you an example of what our camera can see. This is an outdoor experiment we conducted where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with a laser, and the scene that we want to capture is hidden around the corner behind this curtain. So our camera system can't actually see it directly. And yet, somehow, our camera can still capture the 3D geometry of this scene."", '01:20': ""So how do we do this? The magic happens here in this camera system. You can think of this as a type of high-speed camera. Not one that operates at 1,000 frames per second, or even a million frames per second, but a trillion frames per second. So fast that it can actually capture the movement of light itself. And to give you an example of just how fast light travels, let's compare it to the speed of a fast-running comic book superhero who can move at up to three times the speed of sound. It takes a pulse of light about 3.3 billionths of a second, or 3.3 nanoseconds, to travel the distance of a meter. Well, in that same time, our superhero has moved less than the width of a human hair. That's pretty fast. But actually, we need to image much faster if we want to capture light moving at subcentimeter scales. So our camera system can capture photons at time frames of just 50 trillionths of a second, or 50 picoseconds."", '02:26': 'So we take this ultra-high-speed camera and we pair it with a laser that sends out short pulses of light. Each pulse travels to this visible wall and some light scatters back to our camera, but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner to the hidden object and back. We repeat this measurement many times to capture the arrival times of many photons from different locations on the wall. And after we capture these measurements, we can create a trillion-frame-per-second video of the wall.', '02:56': 'While this wall may look ordinary to our own eyes, at a trillion frames per second, we can see something truly incredible. We can actually see waves of light scattered back from the hidden scene and splashing against the wall. And each of these waves carries information about the hidden object that sent it. So we can take these measurements and pass them into a reconstruction algorithm to then recover the 3D geometry of this hidden scene.', '03:25': ""Now I want to show you one more example of an indoor scene that we captured, this time with a variety of different hidden objects. And these objects have different appearances, so they reflect light differently. For example, this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently than the mirror disco ball or the white discus thrower statue. And we can actually see the differences in the reflected light by visualizing it as this 3D volume, where we've just taken the video frames and stacked them together. And time here is represented as the depth dimension of this cube."", '04:00': ""These bright dots that you see are reflections of light from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball, scattering against the wall over time. The bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall, and the other streaks of light come from reflections of light from the bookcase and from the statue."", '04:22': 'Now, we can also visualize these measurements frame by frame, as a video, to directly see the scattered light. And again, here we see, first, reflections of light from the dragon, closest to the wall, followed by bright dots from the disco ball and other reflections from the bookcase. And finally, we see the reflected waves of light from the statue. These waves of light illuminating the wall are like fireworks that last for just trillionths of a second. And even though these objects reflect light differently, we can still reconstruct their shapes. And this is what you can see from around the corner.', '05:08': ""Now, I want to show you one more example that's slightly different. In this video, you see me dressed in this reflective suit and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of four times every second. The suit is reflective, so we can actually capture enough photons that we can see where I am and what I'm doing, without the camera actually directly imaging me. By capturing photons that scatter from the wall to my tracksuit, back to the wall and back to the camera, we can capture this indirect video in real time."", '05:41': 'And we think that this type of practical non-line-of-sight imaging could be useful for applications including for self-driving cars, but also for biomedical imaging, where we need to see into the tiny structures of the body. And perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots that we send to explore other planets.', '06:01': ""Now you may have heard about seeing around corners before, but what I showed you today would have been impossible just two years ago. For example, we can now image large, room-sized hidden scenes outdoors and at real-time rates, and we've made significant advancements towards making this a practical technology that you could actually see on a car someday."", '06:20': ""But of course, there's still challenges remaining. For example, can we image hidden scenes at long distances where we're collecting very, very few photons, with lasers that are low-power and that are eye-safe. Or can we create images from photons that have scattered around many more times than just a single bounce around the corner? Can we take our prototype system that's, well, currently large and bulky, and miniaturize it into something that could be useful for biomedical imaging or perhaps a sort of improved home-security system, or can we take this new imaging modality and use it for other applications?

Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up. If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn\'t tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat, she would ask, ""Are all the children in?"" And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, ""Fix a plate"" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.', '01:01': 'Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call ""make over"" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored, all are honored.', '01:49': 'Also, we had to make a report on our extended ""visited"" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in. My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said, ""To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.""', '02:32': 'And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says, ""If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, \'Nothing.\' And if they insist, say, \'Whatever you mind to give me.\'"" This was the nature of being at that table. In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, ""Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy.""', '03:14': ""So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion. Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it. And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in? And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world."", '03:49': 'Now, it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning. Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.', '04:24': 'There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels? Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.', '05:04': 'And mom overheard us and said, ""Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That\'s what the celebration is all about. It\'s time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."" So, we sucked up. (Laughter)', '05:34': 'But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And, like Chief Seattle said, ""We did not spin the web of life. We\'re all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."" Now that\'s compassion.', '06:05': 'So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures, and something says, ""Now, that\'s compassion."" A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there\'s someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion.', '06:42': 'I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.', '07:25': 'So, there\'s another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said, ""It\'s going to be too volatile for you to go."" He insisted, ""I must go.""', '08:04': 'So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, ""I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But,"" he said, ""what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel."" And he said, ""I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."" That\'s a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.', '09:08': 'I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: ""As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."" Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.', '10:05': 'One more picture while I\'m stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, ""That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city. It was,"" he said, ""one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them. \'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.\' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other.""', '11:10': 'I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher. Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too. Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, ""Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."" So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion? How do you make it real?', '11:43': 'My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the ""Good Samaritan."" Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.', '12:26': 'The question was: ""What is the greatest commandment?"" And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, ""You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself.""', '12:43': 'And then the person asked, ""Well, what do you mean, \'neighbor?\'""', '12:49': 'And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, ""Take care of him."" And he said, ""Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return.""', '13:49': 'This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, \'a system of sustained care \' -- in the inn, take care. I think maybe it\'s one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God\'s children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, ""In regards to health, are all the children in?"" And we could say yes.', '14:32': 'Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.', '15:10': 'But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together.', '15:52': ""So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal."", '17:05': ""Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it."", '17:46': 'The song says, ♫ ""I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God\'s love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I\'m so happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ I\'m happy. Look at me. I\'m happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I\'m happy. Look at me. I\'m happy. Can\'t you see? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫', '18:18': ""That's compassion. (Applause)""}"

And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates the way we perceive reality. And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way. Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual experience of the world. As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is happening at all."", '00:37': 'Take the glasses I usually wear, for example. These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings. I barely notice them, even though they are constantly framing reality for me. The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing: change what we see and think but go unnoticed.', '01:00': 'Now, the only time I do notice my glasses is when something happens to draw my attention to it, like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes. So I asked myself, ""As an artist, what can I create to draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media -- like news organizations, social media platforms, advertising and search engines -- are shaping our reality?"" So I created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we see the world.', '01:41': ""For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to ideas that are different from ours. We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy. So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red. It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it. It has two modes: nocebo and placebo. In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy. Whenever I see red, the red expands. It's similar to social media's amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you, you tend to stick with like-minded people and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry. Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion. Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger. In placebo mode, it's an artificial cure for this allergy. Whenever you see red, the red shrinks. It's a palliative, like in digital media. When you encounter people with different opinions, we will unfollow them, remove them completely out of our feeds. It cures this allergy by avoiding it. But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated."", '03:19': ""The device inside the helmet reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented reality. I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high visibility and it's political. So what if we take a look at the last American presidential election map through the helmet?"", '03:42': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, because the mediation alters our perceptions. The allergy exists on both sides."", '03:55': ""In digital media, what we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced. If we are not aware of this, we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies."", '04:11': ""Our perception is not only part of our identities, but in digital media, it's also a part of the value chain. Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value. Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases, algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions, so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized to sell ads. Like, when this little red dot comes out in your notifications, it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge."", '04:53': ""So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with another project. Now, keep in mind this is conceptual. It's not a real product. It's a web browser plug-in that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore. Like the helmet, the plug-in reshapes reality, but this time, directly into the digital media itself. It shouts out the hidden filtered voices. What you should be noticing now will be bigger and vibrant, like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats."", '05:33': '(Laughter)', '05:35': 'The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm. Like, here in this comment section, there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions. The plug-in makes their comments super small.', '05:49': '(Laughter)', '05:50': 'So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation.', '06:00': '(Laughter)', '06:03': '(Applause)', '06:09': 'The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field and how much of our perception is being commoditized. Different from ad blockers, for every ad you see on the web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning.', '06:24': '(Laughter)', '06:26': 'We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality, so the next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality and show you things as they really are.', '06:39': '(Laughter)', '06:42': '(Applause)', '06:47': ""Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go. Believe me, I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product. And I created this with good intentions to train our perception and eliminate biases. But the same approach could be used with bad intentions, like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control the public narrative. It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just becoming another layer of mediation."", '07:20': 'So what does all this mean for us? Even though technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again by breaking the existing model and going beyond it. By exploring how we interface with these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and finally find common ground between each other.', '07:47': ""Technology is never neutral. It provides a context and frames reality. It's part of the problem and part of the solution. We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently, choose how we see each other."", '08:06': 'Thank you.', '08:07': '(Applause)'}"
https://www.ted.com/talks/thea_holcomb_how_peer_educators_can_transform_sex_education,How peer educators can transform sex education,"Where are teens supposed to learn about sex, asks student speaker Thea Holcomb. From alarmist imagery about sexually transmitted diseases? From the Internet and all its attendant judgment, bias and dysfunction? The answer, she suggests, lies with peer educators. In this talk, Holcomb explains why properly trained peer educators are the right people to disseminate both accurate information and healthy attitudes. As she says, ""When you get accurate, judgment-free information from your peers, you realize that sex ed doesn't have to be scary.""",,,249078,2019-02-01T23:50:22+00:00,"['sex', 'gender', 'education', 'youth', 'relationships']","['English', 'Español', 'Português brasileiro', 'Русский', 'العربية']",Thea Holcomb,Peer educator,"{'0:00': 'Greetings audience, I\'m Thea, I\'m a high school student, and today we\'re going to talk about sex. [It won\'t be too scary.] Operating on the assumption you\'re human, you\'ve certainly heard of sex. In case you haven\'t, to get you up to speed, sex is the process by which many organisms ensure their continued existence. Here\'s the thing though: sex is more complicated than that because - spoiler alert! - humans are complicated. So how do we learn about sex if it\'s so complicated? You might remember sex education like this: [Don\'t have sex; you will get PREGNANT and die.] Urban Dictionary - your source for news and information about the 21st century zeitgeist - describes sex education as:  "".. where they try to scare you out of having sex with pictures of diseased genitals..."" A more hopeful description of sex education would be something like: a lifelong process of learning about sex and sexuality, exploring values and beliefs and gaining skills to navigate relationships and manage your sexual health. This, as far as I\'m concerned, is a solid definition. So what can we do to make sex education something that teens find actually, like, educational. Clearly, teens need answers to their questions. Where do people go when they have questions? [The Internet] Listen, I love the Internet. It\'s one of the greatest developments in human information exchange. [Yes. Thanks Internet.] But what it says about sexual health is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination or is so laden with bias that it feels more like being pelted with judgement than actually receiving information. Unfortunately, not every teen is willing and able to chat it up with their parents about sex. So if not always the Internet, where can teens turn? Enter the peer educator. People my age do, indeed, talk to each other about sex. So when teens are sources of accurate information, it spreads among us quickly. As a peer educator, I belong to a program that gives me the tools to learn about everything from STIs and safe sex to contraception and consent. Basically, I can tell you more about human sexuality than the average adult. When teens see someone like me instead of someone older, they\'re quite open to the information I have to offer them. At lunch once, some friends wanted to know the difference between hormonal and copper IUDs. So I brought this to the table. Another day, my teacher didn\'t understand how emergency contraception works. So I explained it to the class. What does it look like when teens ask me questions about sexual health? It goes something like this. Venereal disease, STD, STI? This terminology, it baffles me. STI stands for sexually transmitted infection. We used to say STD, which stood for sexually transmitted disease, but it was changed recently because STI is a more medically accurate term, and taking away the big scary word ""disease"" helps decrease stigma. What the heck is trichomoniasis? Well, trichomoniasis is a STI usually spread through vaginal intercourse. It\'s curable with just one dose of an oral drug. Common symptoms, regardless of a person\'s sex, are unusual discharge, painful urination and itching. But it spreads really quickly because most of the time it\'s asymptomatic, which means people don\'t realize they have it. That\'s why it\'s so important to get tested regularly. Is it OK to be gay? Yes, all people of all identities and backgrounds, including on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, can live healthy and productive lives. Regardless of your beliefs, everyone has the right to explore and express their sexuality without the fear of shame or judgement. Thanks! So often, when my peers approach me with questions like these, seeking this or that piece of information, at least a sliver of what they\'re wondering is: ""Am I normal?"" So let\'s talk about normal. Part of the point of peer education is to give teens the opportunity to understand that there is no such thing as the elusive ""normal."" Peer educators are here to say they\'re armed with information that empowers you to make informed decisions; you are going to be OK. ""Normal"" isn\'t really necessary. When you can get accurate, judgement-free information from your peers, you realize that sex-ed doesn\'t have to be scary. So instead of striving to be normal, let\'s talk to each other. Since peer education allows sex-ed to reach the community in ways that go far beyond pictures of diseased genitals, it turns out to be pretty brilliant. An idea that, unlike trichomoniasis, is certainly worth spreading.'}"

After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular with the reigning government.', '01:23': 'Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies were a far cry from the sweeping changes Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara,"" Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, women, and young people. He even tried to persuade other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest.', '02:20': 'Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta.', '02:55': 'Finally in charge, Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, he renamed the country from its French colonial title ""Upper Volta"" to ""Burkina Faso,"" which translates to “Land of Upright Men."" Over the next four years he established a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military.', '03:48': 'However, Sankara’s socialist policies were met with much resistance. Many students and elites believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso from its capitalist peers. His crackdown on the misuse of public funds turned government officials against him as well. After four years, what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready to yield his power. He executed increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends against him.', '04:26': 'On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered by his friend Blaise Compaoré.', '04:41': 'Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place as an icon of revolution for his country and throughout the world.'}"

I'd like to take you on a journey into the sea, looking at it from the perspective of its smallest inhabitants: the microbes. My goal is that after this short journey, you'll share my amazement at how deeply connected our lives are to these microscopic creatures and also perhaps my concern that these relationships are often neglected when it comes to making decisions and policies about our oceans."", '00:44': ""When you look out on a clear blue ocean, you're actually gazing at a microbial soup full of vibrant life. What you see here are marine bacteria buzzing about and exploring other members of the marine food web. To emphasize how small this world really is, I've added a white line to most of my slides that shows you the thickness of a single strand of human hair -- very tiny. An average teaspoon of clean seawater has five million bacteria and 50 million viruses in it. If I were to scoop up two gallons of seawater, there would be more bacteria in those two gallons than there are people on this planet. Take just a moment and think about how many gallons might make up an ocean. Or maybe I've already made your stomach turn, as you think of all of the seawater we've each accidentally swallowed over the years. But luckily, we rarely get sick from that seawater, because most marine microbes are working for us, not against us."", '01:45': 'One of my favorite examples is that they provide half of the oxygen we breathe. In middle school, we all learn to thank the trees. And admittedly, they may be more huggable than the microbes. But it turns out that land plants only create a quarter of the oxygen we breathe. Another quarter comes from macroalgae like kelp and a full 50% from the microbes. Take a deep breath in. Thank the trees. Take another deep breath in. Thank the macroalgae. Your next two breaths -- tip your hats to the microbes.', '02:20': 'This picture is of a bacterium that happens to be the single most abundant photosynthesizer on our planet. It\'s called, ""Prochlorococcus,"" and this is oceans\' oxygen-producing powerhouse and, I might argue, one of the most amazing discoveries of recent marine microbiology. We didn\'t know it existed until 1988. All of human history has depended on this little microbe for the oxygen they breathe every day, no matter where or when they lived. And we\'ve only been aware of that relationship for a mere 24 years. I find that astounding. How many more critical relationships are out there that we have yet to discover?', '03:00': 'I see our relationship with marine microbes as parallel in many ways to the relationship we have with microbes in our gut. We\'ve all experienced the wrath of unhappy gut microbes at one point or another, perhaps food poisoning or tainted water. But we may be less aware of the connection we have with marine microbes and the physical discomforts we can feel when those communities change. As an extreme example: the disease cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in the ocean. So while most marine microbes are indeed helping us, there do remain plenty that are not. Our relationship with the ocean, much like our gut, is dependent on the right balance of microbes. The old phrase, ""You are what you eat"" applies to our ocean microbes as well.', '03:48': ""To give you a sense of what an overfed ocean may look like, here are two examples of me sampling seawater. On your left, it's a clean coral reef, and on your right is a nearly dead coral reef that has a very intense fish farming operation in the waters there. You'll notice I'm only smiling in one of these two pictures, and in the other one my dive buddy had to be a whole lot closer to capture that image. So if we were to take a drop of seawater from each of these samples and put it under the microscope, this is what the bacteria and viral communities would look like. So again, clean reef on your left, fish farm reef on your right. As we all have had a feeling of discomfort from imbalanced gut microbes, a fish swimming through a part of the ocean that has been overfed in this way -- in this case, by intense aquaculture, but it could be a sewage spill or fertilizer runoff or any number of other sources -- that fish will feel the physical discomforts of the ocean microbes being out of whack. There may be less oxygen present, there may be more pathogens there, and there may be toxins produced by some of these microbes. The bottom line is that from their tiny-scale existence, these tiny microbes have a very large-scale power to control how our ocean smells, how it tastes, how it feels and how it looks."", '05:10': ""If you take one idea away from my talk today, let it be this: we have an incredibly important relationship with these marine microbes that have very large-scale consequences, and we're just barely beginning to understand what that relationship looks like and how it may be changing. Just as a physician will have trouble curing a disease of unknown cause, we will have similar trouble restoring ocean health without understanding the microbes better. They are the invisible engineers that control the chemistry of the ocean and therefore, what creatures can live there, whether or not it's safe for us to swim there and all of the other characteristics we sense with our eyes, noses and taste buds. And the more we pay attention to these small but very numerous members of the ocean, the more we're learning they do indeed respond to human actions, such as in this fish farm example."", '06:00': ""Now, as the past few slides about coral reefs may have suggested, I do indeed spend much of my time as a researcher thinking about human-microbe interactions, specifically on coral reefs. It turns out, we're not alone in having our own protective community of microbes. Corals, along with most other organisms on this planet, have their own protective communities as well. However, rather than keeping theirs on the inside as we do in our gut, they keep theirs on the outside, to protect them from their surroundings So what you're seeing here is a three-dimensional image of a live spot on a living coral with all of its living bacteria, that I took with some exciting technology -- a high-speed laser-scanning confocal microscope. All of the red circles are the symbiotic algae that live inside the coral tissue, turning sunlight and into sugars they both can use, and all of the little blue dots are the protective bacteria. So when I use image analysis software to highlight the outer layer of the coral in white, you can see that there are still some tiny little blue dots above that layer. And those bacteria are sitting in a mucus layer, which is also part of the coral's protective layer."", '07:15': ""From the bigger perspective, I spend my time thinking about these relationships, because too many reefs are going from looking like the picture on your left to the picture on your right. Believe it or not, the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist snorkeling spot on the island of Maui, even though it's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so. Corals are getting sick all around the globe at alarming rates, and we really don't know how or why. I see the microbes on the coral reefs, both the good ones and the bad ones, trying to link their micro-scale behaviors to this big picture of: How do we help the reef that looks like the right back towards something that looks more like the left? Or: How do we stop coral disease from spreading?"", '07:59': ""Just over a year ago, no one had ever seen a view like this. This video is a prime example of making the invisible visible. We're looking at a side view of the same coral as before, where the protective layer meets the seawater; so, seawater on your right, coral on your left. It's incredibly exciting to me that we can finally see these bacteria in real life, in real time, at their micro scale, and learn how they interact with the world around them. Ecologists all over the world are used to being able to grab a pair of binoculars and go out and observe what their study creatures do each day. But microbial ecologists have desperately needed breakthroughs in technology, such as with this fast confocal, to make similar observations. I work to find ways that cutting-edge technologies like this can help make the unseen seeable, to see marine bacteria in action and learn how they behave. In doing so, we can learn how they respond to our actions and our behaviors and the environment around them in ways that will help us better manage our oceans."", '09:04': ""Another example of how I'm doing this is by using microfluidics to study specifically how pathogens behave in the ocean. The basic idea behind microfluidics is that you can use nanofabrication techniques to recreate or mimic the conditions bacteria experience at their own tiny scale in the ocean. What you see here is a microfluidic chamber on a microscope slide with a microscope lens underneath it. We use high-speed video microscopy to record bacteria behavior. The colored tubing is where bacteria and seawater flow in and out of the device. And it's using a device like this that I recently discovered that a known coral pathogen actually has the ability to sniff around the seawater and hunt for corals. Here's the video of in action. You'll see all of the pathogens which are the tiny green dots on the left start detecting the coral mucus I put on the right side of the channel, and they swim quickly over in that direction and stay there. Up until now, it was thought that a pathogen would need some good luck to find its host in the ocean. But simply by watching and observing, we can learn that these bacteria are very well adapted to seeking out their victims."", '10:25': ""These micro-channels are bringing us closer than ever before to understanding how bacteria navigate that big blue ocean. It turns out that this pathogen can even detect the coral mucus when I dilute it 20,000 fold. So these bacteria are very well adapted to hunting down these corals. I'm currently testing different environmental conditions to see what scenarios make this pathogen more or less capable of hunting corals. By learning more about what triggers the hunt, we should be able to find ways to help slow down or prevent this disease. There's also some evidence that the healthy microbes on the coral can fight off the pathogen if the conditions are right."", '11:14': ""So, one final image of a coral and its healthy bacteria. I hope you've enjoyed this short journey into our microbial oceans and that the next time you look out at the sea, you'll take in a deep breath of fresh ocean air and wonder: What else are all of the unseen microbes doing to keep us and our oceans healthy?"", '11:32': 'Thank you.'}"

Songs that sing of sorrow, of grief, of longing, of the darker side of love, the underside of being alive, these are the songs I just never tire of hearing and I never tire of writing, because they make me feel less alone. They speak to a very real part of being human that can often be hidden in fear and shame and pushed deep down where it lingers and rots."", '04:38': ""But I think in listening to these songs -- really listening -- can allow us to refeel these hard emotions, but in a cathartic and healing way.

Cherry blossoms fall within a single week -- can be whisked away on the gentlest breeze -- and it\'s this that makes it more beautiful.

At first glance, this painting may appear to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter and sculptor. But the magic behind this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself.', '00:45': 'Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little personal connection to it.', '01:10': 'After moving to New York, she was increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color.', '01:33': 'These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching, any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings.', '02:05': 'Experiments like these would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement called American Modernism. Although no single style defines Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, Modernist painting often used geometric shapes and bold colors to probe the American psyche.', '02:29': 'O’Keeffe threw herself into these experiments — but she was reluctant to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead to marriage in 1924.', '02:52': 'Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint for months at a time. Whether she was exploring the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention to small details, and spent hours mixing paints to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue, she’d record it in her ever-growing collection of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In ""Rams Head with Hollyhock,"" she places a weathered skull and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows the landscape, casting both the skeleton and the mountains in a new, eerie light.', '03:46': 'The public was captivated by her unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed such interpretations. She resented the male gaze that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation of the natural world.', '04:15': 'Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s mysteries in new, tactile mediums.

Jamais Cascio looks at some specific tools and techniques that can make a difference.

I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job. I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com. Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003, and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there, right now and on the near horizon."", '00:34': ""In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items -- replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas -- all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable. Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.  There are tons of places to go, online and off, if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving. We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it. We focus primarily on the planet's environment, but we also address issues of global development, international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies, even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower and much, much more."", '01:26': ""The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad, but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so. A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface, but to give you a sense of what we cover: tools for rapid disaster relief, such as this inflatable concrete shelter; innovative uses of bioscience, such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines; ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices; distributed power generation using solar power, wind power, ocean power, other clean energy sources; ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future; ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now; and better urban design,  so you don't need to drive as much in the first place;  bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging: cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs, the consequences of extreme longevity, the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder."", '02:37': 'As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er, hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday, I\'m naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me, much to my own surprise, that successful responses to the world\'s problems are nonetheless possible. Moreover, I\'ve come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success. As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed, ""Pessimism is a luxury of good times ... In difficult times, pessimism is a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."" The truth is, we can build a better world, and we can do so right now. We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago, and we\'re coming up with new ones all the time. We have the knowledge, and our understanding of the planet improves every day. Most importantly, we have the motive: we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody\'s going to do it for us.', '03:39': 'Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common: transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment, and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science! (Laughter) The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world-changing ways.', '04:10': ""We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible -- that is, to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible. We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions. As a small example, many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency. The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily. Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding, can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion. Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions, or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps, allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all."", '05:29': ""We can see world-changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action. Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers, but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions are far more important. For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science, make cutting-edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world. And actually, a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model. Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. That genome data can now be found on open-access genetic data banks around the world, and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments. But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus. The U.S. National Research Council in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly."", '06:49': ""And we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone -- and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't? (Laughter) For many of us, cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves, and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about. You may already know some of the big-picture aspects: globally, more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera, and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens, and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books. In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers. A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa. In Kenya, mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency. The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press. (Laughter)"", '07:56': ""And it's just going to get more wild. Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video, even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket, will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate. It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies. And in this rapidly evolving context, it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction."", '08:22': ""I've long admired the Witness project, and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday, in his profoundly moving presentation. And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand-carrying the videotape. Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses, it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation."", '08:54': 'Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists. Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what\'s happening to the planet: putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds, from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures. It would highlight the changes that are underway, but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world, a better world, come about. It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet. It would be, in essence, an ""Earth Witness"" project. Now, just to be clear, in this talk I\'m using the name ""Earth Witness"" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization. It could just as easily be called, ""Environmental Transparency Project,"" ""Smart Mobs for Natural Security"" -- but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.', '09:53': ""Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise, especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions. That's understandable and important. We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage. But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.  In the best Worldchanging tradition, it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility. Earth Witness would show us two worlds: the world we're leaving behind, and the world we're building for generations to come."", '10:34': ""And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today. The key components are already widely available. Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project. And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet to always-on, widely available information tools. We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones. You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones. Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project. At the other end of the network, there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to, accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service, social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system. Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly. That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more."", '11:55': ""An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone. Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine, using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution. It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person. Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new: phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath, or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure. Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results. Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs."", '12:58': ""Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels, the presence of some biotoxins -- potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus. You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project. Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis. And that's worth noting in particular.  The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal. Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps, from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu. Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world."", '13:54': ""It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed. We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone. It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up. And most important, you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth. This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data. And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters. A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us  to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately, the improvement of the planet itself."", '14:51': ""Now, as I suggested at the outset, there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there, so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist? Because this is what tomorrow could look like: bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other. Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves. We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models, powerful tools, and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future. We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all; we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used. There's a staggering array of wonders out there, across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing: success can be ours if we're willing to try. And as we say at Worldchanging, another world isn't just possible; another world is here. We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.""}"

That\'s sort of an interesting enough topic to me. And the reason was, because when I was asked to do this, I\'d just read in one of the papers, I can\'t remember, something from someone at Facebook saying, ""Well, we need to make everybody use their real names, and then that\'s basically all the problems solved."" And that\'s so wrong, that\'s such a fundamentally reactionary view of identity, and it\'s going to get us into all sorts of trouble. And so what I thought I\'d do is, I\'ll explain four sort of problems about it, and then I\'ll suggest a solution, which, hopefully, you might find interesting.', '00:42': 'So just to frame the problem: What does ""authenticity"" mean? That\'s me, that\'s a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting.', '00:52': ""[What's the Problem?]"", '00:53': ""That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger, and because I'm not very good at presentations, I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card. And he was incarcerated in, I think, Wakefield Prison, for forging masterpieces by, I think, French Impressionists. And he's so good at it that when he was in prison, everybody in prison, the governor and whatever, wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls because they were so good. And so that's a masterpiece, which is a fake of a masterpiece, and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake, if you see what I mean."", '01:28': '(Laughter)', '01:29': ""So when we're talking about authenticity, it's a little more fractal than it appears, and that's a good example to show it. I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly."", '01:41': 'So the first problem, I thought, chip and PIN, right?', '01:44': '[Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within]', '01:47': '[Offline solutions do not work online]', '01:49': ""Everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right? So why is that a good example? That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well-constructed system. That chip-and-PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop, is extremely secure, you can put scanning electron microscopes on it, you can try and grind it down, blah blah blah. Those chips have never been broken, whatever you read in the paper. And for a joke, we take that supersecure chip, and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe. And for very lazy criminals, we still emboss the card. So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card, you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to speed things up. And even more amusingly, and on my debit card, too, we print the name and the sort code and everything else on the front. Why? There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip-and-PIN card. And if you think about it, it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first. Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals. You know what your name is, right?"", '02:55': '(Laughter)', '02:56': 'And when you go into a shop and buy something, it\'s a PIN -- he doesn\'t care what the name is. The only place you ever have to write your name on the back is in America. Whenever I go to America, and I have to pay with a magstripe on the back of the card, I always sign it ""Carlos Tethers"" anyway, just as a security mechanism, because if a transaction ever gets disputed, and it comes back and it says ""Dave Birch,"" I know it must have been a criminal, because I would never sign it ""Dave Birch.""', '03:21': '(Laughter)', '03:22': ""So if you drop your card in the street, it means a criminal can pick it up and read it. They know the name, from the name, they can find the address, and then they can go off and buy stuff online. Why do we put the name on the card? Because we think identity is something to do with names, and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card, which obsesses us. And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago, but if you're someone in politics or the Home Office or whatever, and you think about identity, you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on. And that's very subversive in a modern world."", '03:56': ""So the second example I thought I'd use is chat rooms."", '04:01': '[Chatrooms and Children]', '04:02': ""I'm very proud of that picture. That's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig, I believe you call it, where he got paid."", '04:10': '(Laughter)', '04:11': ""And I love that picture. I'll like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better,"", '04:16': '(Laughter)', '04:17': 'I like that one for the moment. Why do I use that picture? Because that was very interesting, watching that experience as an old person.', '04:24': 'So him and his friends, they get together, they booked a room, like a church hall, and they got all their friends who had bands, got them together, and they do it all on Facebook, and then they sell tickets, and the first band on the -- I was going to say ""menu,"" that\'s probably the wrong word for it, isn\'t it? The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first 20 tickets, then the next band gets the next 20, and so on. They were at the bottom of the menu, like, fifth, I thought they had no chance. He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right? But my point is, that all worked perfectly, except on the web.', '05:02': 'So they\'re sitting on Facebook, and they\'re sending these messages and arranging things, and they don\'t know who anybody is, right? That\'s the problem we\'re trying to solve. If only they were using real names, then you wouldn\'t be worried about them on the internet. So when he says to me, ""Oh, I want to go to a chat room to talk about guitars"" or something, I\'m like, ""Oh, well, I don\'t want you to go into a chat room to talk about guitars, because they might not all be your friends, and some of the people that are in the chat room might be, you know, perverts and teachers and vicars --""', '05:34': '(Laughter)', '05:35': 'I mean, they generally are, when you look in the paper, right? ""So I want to know who all the people in the chat room are. So, OK, you can go in the chat room, but only if everybody in the chat room is using their real names, and they submit full copies of their police report.""', '05:50': '(Laughter)', '05:51': 'But of course, if anybody in the chat room asked for his real name, I\'d say, ""No. You can\'t give them your real name, because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever?""', '06:01': ""So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is, but I don't want anybody else to know who he is. And so you get this sort of logjam around identity, where you want full disclosure from everybody else, but not from yourself. And there's no progress, we get stuck. So the chat room thing doesn't work properly, and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity."", '06:23': 'Cheerleading ... so, on my RSS feed, I saw this thing about -- I just said something bad about my RSS feed, didn\'t I? I should stop saying it like that. For some random reason I can\'t imagine, something about cheerleaders turned up in my in-box. And I read this story about cheerleaders, and it\'s a fascinating story. This happened a couple of years ago in the US. There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the US, and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach, as I\'m sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time, and somehow, the cheerleading coach found out about this. She was very upset. So she went to one of the girls and said, ""You have to give me your Facebook password."" I read this all the time, where even at some universities and places of education, kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords. So you have to give them your Facebook password. So the kid -- she was a kid! -- what she should have said is, ""My lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning. It\'s an outrageous imposition on my Fourth Amendment right to privacy. You\'ll be sued for all the money you\'ve got!"" That\'s what she should have said. But she\'s a kid, so she hands over the password. The teacher can\'t log in, because the school has blocked access to Facebook. So the teacher can\'t log into Facebook till she gets home. So the girl tells her friends, ""Guess what happened? The teacher logged in. She knows."" So the girls all logged into Facebook and deleted their profiles. So when the teacher logged in, there was nothing there. My point is: those identities, they don\'t think about them the same way.', '07:43': ""Identity is -- especially when you're a teenager -- a fluid thing. You have lots of identities, you experiment with them. And if you have an identity you don't like because it's subverted in some way or it's insecure or it's inappropriate, you just delete it and get another one. The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone, the government or whatever, and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places is absolutely wrong. Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook, unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way? It just doesn't work properly."", '08:14': 'And my fourth example is, there are some cases where you really want to be -- in case you\'re wondering, that\'s me at the G20 protest. I wasn\'t actually at the G20 protest, but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G20 protest. And I got an email from the bank, saying, ""Please don\'t wear a suit, because it\'ll inflame the protesters."" I look pretty good in a suit, frankly, so you can see why it would drive them into an anticapitalist frenzy.', '08:39': '(Laughter)', '08:40': 'So I thought, ""Well, if I don\'t want to inflame the protesters, the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester."" So I went dressed completely in black, you know, black balaclava ... I had black gloves on but took them off to sign the visitors\' book.', '08:52': '(Laughter)', '08:53': 'I\'m wearing black trousers and boots, I\'m dressed completely in black. I go into the bank at 10am and go, ""Hi, I\'m Dave Birch, I\'ve got a 3 o\'clock with so-and-so."" ""Sure!"" And they sign me in. There\'s my visitor\'s badge.', '09:04': '(Laughter)', '09:05': 'So this nonsense about ""you\'ve got to have real names on Facebook"" and whatever, that gets you that kind of security. That gets you ""security theater,"" where there\'s no actual security, but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security, and as long as everybody learns their lines, everyone\'s happy. But it\'s not real security, right? Especially because I hate banks more than the G20 protesters do, because I work for them. I know that things are actually worse than these guys think.', '09:31': '(Laughter)', '09:34': 'But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something -- you know, they were like people who take the money from banks and don\'t ... you know, they take the money ... Oh -- ""traders."" That\'s the word I was thinking of. Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader, and I want to report it to the boss of the bank. So I log on to do a little whistleblowing. I send a message, ""This guy\'s a rogue trader."" That message is meaningless if you don\'t know that I\'m a trader at the bank. If that message just comes from anybody, it has zero information value. There\'s no point in sending that message. You have to know that I\'m ... But if I have to prove who I am, I\'ll never send that message. It\'s just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. That message will only happen if I\'m anonymous. So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity in it, otherwise, we don\'t get where we want to get to.', '10:29': 'So, four issues. So what are we going to do about it? Well, what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell-space. And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in 1953. So we think if we had a card -- call it a Facebook login -- which proves who you are, and I make you carry it all the time, that solves the problem. And of course, for all those reasons I\'ve just outlined, it doesn\'t, and it might make some problems worse. The more times you\'re forced to use your real identity, certainly in transactional terms, the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted. The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don\'t need identity, which is actually almost all transactions. Almost all of the transactions you do are not ""Who are you?"" They\'re ""Are you allowed to drive the car?"" ""Are you allowed in the building?"" ""Are you over 18?"" etcetera, etcetera. So my suggestion -- I, like James, think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R and D.', '11:27': ""I think this is a solvable problem. It's something we can do about. Naturally, in these circumstances, I turn to Doctor Who. Because in this --"", '11:34': '(Laughter)', '11:35': 'as in so many other walks of life, Doctor Who has already shown us the answer. So I should say, for some of our foreign visitors: Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England --', '11:46': '(Laughter)', '11:48': 'and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us. And this is Doctor Who with his ""psychic paper."" Come on, you guys must have seen Doctor Who\'s ""psychic paper."" You\'re not nerds if you say yes. Who\'s seen Doctor Who\'s psychic paper? Oh right, you were in the library the whole time studying, I guess. Is that what you\'re going to tell us? Doctor Who\'s psychic paper is: when you hold up the psychic paper, the person, in their brain, sees the thing that they need to see. So I want to show you a British passport, I hold up the psychic paper, you see a British passport. I want to get into a party, I hold up the psychic paper, I show you a party invitation. You see what you want to see. So what I\'m saying is, we need to make an electronic version of that, but with one tiny, tiny change, which is that it\'ll only show you the British passport if I\'ve actually got one. It\'ll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one. It will only show you that I\'m over 18 if I actually am over 18. But nothing else. So you\'re the bouncer at the pub, you need to know that I\'m over 18. Instead of showing you my driving license, which shows you I know how to drive, what my name is, my address, all these kind of things, I show you my psychic paper, and all it tells you is, am I over 18 or not. Right.', '12:59': ""Is that just a pipe dream? Of course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here talking. So, in order to build that and make it work, I'm only going to name these things, I'll not go into them: we need a plan, which is, we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use to solve all of these problems. We're going to make a utility. The utility has to be universal, you can use it everywhere. I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along."", '13:23': 'That\'s a Japanese ATM, the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone. So when you want to draw money out, you put the phone on the ATM and touch your finger, your fingerprint goes through to the phone, the phone says, ""Yes, that\'s whoever,"" and the ATM then gives you some money. It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere. It has to be absolutely convenient.', '13:41': ""That's me going into the pub. All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is: Is this person over 18 and not barred from the pub? And so the idea is, you touch your ID card to the door, and if I'm allowed in, it shows my picture, if I'm not, it shows a red cross. It doesn't disclose any other information. It has to have no special gadgets. That can only mean one thing, following on from Ross's statement, which I agree with completely: if it means no special gadgets, it has to run on a mobile phone. That's the only choice we have, to make it work on mobile phones. There are 6.6 billion mobile phone subscriptions. My favorite statistic of all time: only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world. That means something. I don't know what."", '14:20': '(Laughter)', '14:21': ""I rely on our futurologists to tell me. It has to be a utility which is extensible. So it has to be something that anybody could build on. Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure; you don't need permissions, licenses, whatever. Anyone should be able to write some code to do this."", '14:37': ""Well, you know what symmetry is, so you don't need a picture of it. This is how we're going to do it. We're going to do it using phones and mobile proximity. I'm going to suggest to you the technology to implement Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here, and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it, you've already got that technology. Have you ever been up to the big city and used an Oyster card? Does that ring a bell? The technology already exists. The first phones that have the technology built in -- the Google Nexus, the S II, the Samsung Wave 578 -- the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops. So the idea that the gasman can turn up at my mum's door, and he can show my mum his phone, and she can tap it with her phone, and it'll come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in, and will come up with red if he isn't, end of story."", '15:25': ""We have the technology to do that. And what's more, although some of those things sound a bit counterintuitive, like proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am, the cryptography to do that not only exists, it's extremely well-known and well-understood. Digital signatures, the blinding of public key certificates -- these technologies have been around for a while, we've just had no way of packaging them up. So the technology already exists. We know it works. There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places. That's London Fashion Week, where we built a system with O2. That's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park. You can see the person's walking in with their VIP band, it's being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic, this stuff works in these environments. They don't need to be special."", '16:11': ""So finally, I know that you can do this, because if you saw the Easter special of Doctor Who, where he went to Mars in a bus -- I should say, again, for our foreign students: that doesn't happen in every episode. This was a very special case. So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus -- I can't show you the clip, due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright by the BBC -- but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus, Doctor Who is clearly shown getting onto the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper. Which proves that psychic paper has an NFC interface."", '16:52': 'Thank you very much.', '16:53': '(Applause)'}"

I was skinny ...', '04:32': '(Laughter)', '04:35': 'Dark chocolate, and a kid with legs up to my armpits. And the very first performance I had, at the Judimar School of Dance, was in a red checkered shirt, dungarees, pink ballet shoes, and we were dancing to ""I\'m an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande."" I loved every minute of it. I mean, I literally did love every minute of it, especially when I heard the applause, and I knew right there, when I was six, I said, ""That\'s for me.""', '05:09': '(Laughter)', '05:11': 'At six, you\'re not thinking that\'s going to be a career of your lifetime, but that was perfect for that moment. I danced my way through school, and through college, and it still didn\'t dawn on me that that\'s what I actually wanted to do. I went to an audition, which I was dreadful in -- it\'s the only audition I\'ve had in my life -- and when I was let go from that audition -- because I thought when they were saying, ""Thank you very much,"" that meant for me to stay.', '05:36': '(Laughter)', '05:39': ""I ran up the steps, and there was a man sitting on the steps.

There's no drama or trauma."", '05:57': '(Applause)', '06:00': 'So I spent 15 years dancing with the company, and then I directed it for something like 21 years.', '06:06': ""If you were black and African American and a dancer, any time between the '40s and the '70s, you had much to say, because your complete voice was not being heard. And you were not being represented as you truly were. Alvin Ailey had the courage, right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, to present the truth about who we were -- that our creativity, our beauty, our intelligence, our talents were an intrinsic part of the panoply of American culture."", '06:38': ""Our mantra has always been to educate, to entertain, and to lift our audiences. Mr. Ailey believed that dance came from the people and needed to be delivered back to the people. We didn't dance in a vacuum. It was our mission to serve people. We call it outreach now, but it's always been a part of who we were and still are, 60 years later, to this day. Being inclusive of our audiences -- it's always been an important part of the company."", '07:15': ""We ask ourselves, who are we dancing for? Why are we dancing, if not to show people what it is to be human and to connect with the audiences that we dance for. We've always felt responsible to make sure the community understood that what we do is a part of their heritage. We just don't do this, also, in America, we do it all over the world. We tour more than any other dance company in the world."", '07:44': 'After Nelson Mandela was released from prison, I thought, well, this is the time to go to South Africa. And that was some outreach. We went to Johannesburg, Soweto, and some other townships that were really in dire straits.

We toured all over the world many times, and whether we're in Europe or South America or Asia or somewhere else, audiences are thrilled and excited. You sounded thrilled and excited. Sometimes with tears in their eyes, because this nonverbal communication really works. And it's about embracing everyone."", '08:43': ""Alvin didn't need to explain to us what was going on at the time in the '60s and the '70s; it was obvious why were doing his work. He knew what the truth of the time was about, and he was unafraid to reveal it through dance. He tapped into every emotion he had and we had, and from angerness to happiness, to grief and everything in between, he knew us. He took our history and turned it into powerful dance."", '09:15': ""He and I overlapped generationally. We didn't have to talk about things so much, because we understood implicitly our shared responsibilities. So when he asked me to take over the company before he passed in 1989, I felt prepared to carry it forward. Alvin and I were like parts of the same tree. He, the roots and the trunk, and we were the branches. I was his muse. We were all his muses."", '09:49': 'The ballet ""Cry,"" which some of you might have seen -- you\'re going to see an excerpt of it -- it was made on me, and Alvin dedicated it to all black women, especially our mothers. When Alvin and I went in the studio, of course he wasn\'t thinking, ""Here I am, creating an iconic work."" Do you know any artist that does that? You don\'t go into the studio to create anything but what\'s coming truthfully from your heart and your spirit. And you trust that you have a dancer you can share that with. Rehearsal space is a sacred space, not to be intruded upon, because it\'s about talking to each other through spirit. You better have some technique on top of that so you can do the dance.', '10:36': '(Laughter)', '10:37': 'He brought his Alvin to ""Cry"" and I brought my Judy to it. I just did the steps. And this was a birthday present for his mother, because he couldn\'t afford to get her a tactile gift.', '10:49': ""When I performed it the first time, it was physically and emotionally draining. I hadn't yet run through the whole piece from beginning to end. The ballet is 16 minutes long. It's about a proud woman who has been to hell and back, from her journey across the Atlantic. She's exhausted, she's a queen, and in this section, you're going to see she is triumphant. She made it, and she is, in that last step that she does, beating away anything negative with her tremendous strength. And in the last step, she digs into the earth and she reaches into the sky ... because she's clearing space for the next journey. I performed it in 1971, and we are still clearing space."", '11:55': ""Now let me leave you with one last thought. Here we are, in the 21st century, still fighting for civil rights. Not a day goes by that we are not made aware of the struggle that continues. I believe that dance can elevate our human experience beyond words.

By age 60, that number averages between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words last less than a second. So with every word, the brain has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses the correct word.', '00:42': 'But how? Speech comprehension is different from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language comprehension— though spoken word recognition has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability to understand speech is the brain’s role as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple different things at the same time. Most theories assume that each word we know is represented by a separate processing unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming speech matching that particular word.', '01:16': 'In the context of the brain, the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units may become active, because with just the beginning of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, more and more units register that some vital piece of information is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, corresponding to one word. This is called the ""recognition point."" In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend up to about 8 syllables per second.', '02:09': 'Yet, the goal is not only to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show that even upon hearing a word fragment— like ""cap""— listeners will start to register multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital, before the full word emerges.', '02:37': 'This suggests that every time we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, like ""bat,"" or ""crane,"" or in cases of homophones like ""no"" or ""know."" For multilingual people, the language they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words that don’t match the language context.', '03:18': 'So, what about adding completely new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across a new word every few days. But if every word is represented as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons with others words.', '03:52': 'Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words.', '04:07': 'So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions of meaning as we chat away.

When I was first asked to do a TED Talk, I Googled to try and find out a little bit more about, you know, how it felt to be giving one. And one of the first things I read was a speaker in the States saying that she felt fine until she came onstage, and then she saw the timer ticking down.', '00:27': '(Laughter)', '00:28': 'And it reminded her of a bomb. I was thinking, ""That\'s the last thing I need.""', '00:33': '(Laughter)', '00:35': '(Applause)', '00:40': ""Anyway, it's a great privilege to be here. I think it's a bit of a joke for an editor of a paper to choose a photographer to open a speaking event."", '00:48': '(Laughter)', '00:49': ""We're not renowned for our words, and I spent the last 40 years hiding behind a camera so I didn't have to speak. But I'm here today, and what I want to talk about are stories and the importance of stories to me and, I think, the importance of stories to everybody. I'm sure today you'll hear a lot of stories and, by listening to other people's stories, I think we can learn about the world, about other people and get a better understanding. So I want to talk about three stories that I've done as a photographer, and how they've inspired me, and how, in my life, I've become a part of the stories that I document myself."", '01:24': ""As John said, I was a fashion photographer and music photographer for 10 years. I enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun, but always wanted to do something more with my work. And storytelling was always something I wanted to do. So 10 years ago, I set out to travel the world, to go and photograph other people in their situations and to record their stories, to bring them back, so that other people might understand. But this didn't happen overnight. When I worked as a music photographer and a fashion photographer, I always had this nagging feeling that there was something missing, that I wasn't quite using my skills productively. And it may seem very obvious, the link, now, but at the time, I couldn't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful. So I gave up photography. I walked away from it completely and decided to do care work."", '02:14': ""As a care worker, I started looking after a young guy called Nick. Nick has autism, very severe autism. But over the years of looking after him, we became very close friends. I would give him a 24-hour care, we would go off and do things from swimming, going for walks ... all sorts. Bit by bit, though, as I got to know him better, I realized that his story wasn't being told. He self-harmed, he would punch himself quite a lot in the face. And nobody really got to see that. So this is Nick. He used to describe his life as living downstairs at a party. He said he could hear the party in the kitchen, but he felt like he was always trapped in the basement, in his own little world, wanting to be part of the party but not able to walk upstairs. So I documented his life. I started to photograph it, not really with any intention of doing anything with the pictures, but just as a way of recording."", '03:15': ""And as I started doing that, I realized that I could tell somebody's story through my photographs. As I said, Nick would self-harm. He would punch himself in the face. And nobody really got to see that. As we built up a kind of closer friendship, he finally would allow me to actually see him doing this and to document it. It was a moment of trust. The social services were not particularly good at helping Nick, and they said that he wouldn't be self-harming as bad as we said."", '03:53': ""So one day, I took a photograph of when he'd really been self-harming. We took that to the social services, and their reaction was immediately incredibly different, and they managed to get a lot of help. And I'm glad to say now, eight years later, I actually spoke to Nick last night, and he wanted to let me know that he was feeling a lot better, and he doesn't do the self-harming anymore. And in some small way, I hope that the photographs was a part of that process. The main thing it did is it inspired me to go out with my camera and to tell other people's stories."", '04:28': 'One of the stories I did was in Kutupalong, on the border of Burma and Bangladesh. Here, the Rohingyas refugees have been left, pretty much to rot, for over 20 years. This is a picture of the unofficial camp. At the top, you can see the official UN camp. All these huts are the unofficial camps. Literally, the raw sewage runs through the camp. The people there have been forgotten, so I thought it was important to go and document their stories. So I arranged with the village elder; the people would come along the next day, and I would take portraits of all these people and record their stories. So as the time went on, I turned up in the morning, I put a big, white sheet up, and I started to photograph these people.', '05:18': 'Suddenly, though, everything got a bit out of control, and, although it was still dawn, we were filled in this small little compound we had made with literally hundreds of people turning up with ailments and diseases and just ... a hopeless situation. And that\'s exactly what their situation is -- helpless. A child with a tumor that nobody helped, who was slowly suffocating. I got in a bit of a panic, because these people were coming up to me, desperate, and I was trying to explain to the village elder that I was not a doctor, and I couldn\'t help these people. And the village elder turned to me and he said, ""No, it\'s really important; these people know you\'re not a doctor, but at least somebody is now telling their story, and somebody is recording what is happening to them."" And it was a good moment for me. It was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things.', '06:14': 'Another story that inspired me was in Odessa, in Ukraine. I was documenting a bunch of street kids. I ended up actually living with them in a squat, which I can say was an experience. Many late nights of vodka-fueled violence with me sitting in the corner with my bag, just going, ""When was this a good idea?""', '06:34': '(Laughter)', '06:35': 'I would say it\'s moments like that when I think, ""Why did I leave the fashion world?""', '06:40': 'But they were great kids, and on the last day, they took me down to the sea for a sort of trip, a sort of farewell. There they are, drinking vodka. And then Serge, who was the oldest and the most violent -- he\'d just got out of the prison for stabbing somebody -- comes and puts his arm around me and says, ""We go swimming."" Now, I have to say, I had a ""Lonely Planet"" guide to Ukraine and in it, it gave some advice. And in that advice was, ""Do not talk to the street kids, at no point leave your baggage unattended and in all counts, do not go swimming.""', '07:15': '(Laughter)', '07:17': 'So I was like, ""I don\'t know if this is a good idea."" Serge has got his arm around me. I\'m like, ""OK."" So there I am.', '07:25': '(Laughter)', '07:26': 'I literally handed all my cameras, all my equipment, to these street kids. And they took it. It\'s kind of funny to know, if you look in the background, you can see the other street kids who didn\'t get in the water go, ""Why would you get in that water?""', '07:39': ""But one of the little kids, Lilic, he was the one who had taken my camera, and he started taking photographs. He was really excited by this camera. And we talked a lot about how I was going to get him a camera and would return and we could start to teach him photography. He had a real eye for things. That's him, there. That was taken on the last evening I was there. I'd been staying there, but that night, I left to go and collect my things. And when I came back in the morning, he was dead. He had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vodka. And he had passed out in the night and didn’t recover. Again, it was another reminder of maybe why I should record these people's stories: because their lives are important, and it's important for me to document them."", '08:22': ""Then in February of last year, when I was on patrol in Afghanistan, I stepped on an IED. That's me down there, somewhere. I became part of the story. At first, I was devastated by what had happened, obviously. I thought my work was over, I thought -- everything didn't make sense to me. And then I realized: I never set out to Congo, to Angola, to Bangladesh to take photographs. I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change, and photography happened to be my tool."", '08:59': ""And then I became aware that my body was, in many ways, a living example of what war does to somebody. And I realized I could use my own experience, my own body, to tell that story. And it was also by looking back at the other people I've documented. I thought of Nick, and I thought of his resilience. I thought of the Rohingyas and the fact that they have no hope. I thought of Lilic and a lost life. And in fact, it was the stories that I've documented that inspired me to get through the last year, to survive, to get back up on my new legs and to be able to come and tell their stories, but also my own story."", '09:41': ""So I did a self-portrait, because I wanted to show everybody what a bomb does to somebody, but also to show that losing your limbs doesn't end your life; that you can have what people say is disability, but not be disabled; that you can be able to do anything if you put your mind to it and have belief in it. It's strange, but in many ways I look at where I was a year ago, and I look at where I am now, and I realize that I have a lot of things I didn't have then. I wouldn't be sitting here right now if this hadn't happened. I wouldn't have been able to show you those photographs and tell you those stories. I was lucky 10 years ago, when I sat down and I tried to work out what I could do to make a difference in this world. I realized that my photography was a tool and a way to do it."", '10:27': 'I think that\'s what\'s really key. It\'s that we all can be part of that wheel. We can all be cogs in a wheel of change. We can all make a difference. Everybody here has an ability to use something to make a difference to the world. We can all sit in front of the TV and go, ""I don\'t know what to do about it,"" and forget about it. But the reality is that we can all do something. It might be just writing a letter. It might be standing on a soapbox and talking. It might be just recording somebody\'s story and telling it to somebody else. But every single one of us here, if we want to make a difference, we can, an there is nothing to stop us. And we all have our own experiences that we can use as well.', '11:07': ""So really, that's all I wanted to talk about today. I just wanted to say that life goes on all around the world. People are going through terrible things. Everyone of us is going through our own terrible experience. But if we share those and we talk about stories, then we can inspire each other to get through our own bad experiences. I know that the people I've recorded have gotten me to this point. And I hope in some small way, the stories I've been able to tell you will help you get through things. And in turn, I hope you will use your experiences to help others."", '11:40': 'Thank you very much.', '11:41': '(Applause)'}"

It snaps on. It has an opening. You've got lids with a little latch that opens and closes. You've got ones that are in creative shapes."", '00:32': 'Coffee cup lids have their own vocabulary. People talk about the ""peripheral skirts,"" the ""press-in dimples,"" the ""fragrance outlets,"" the ""slosh factor."" But you need these words, because so much thought and innovation goes into these coffee cup lids.', '00:47': ""Our society is just more and more mobile. Everything is on the move. The good part: it's convenient. You can drink coffee anywhere, you don't have the stay in the diner. It can be in the subway. You can be walking. The bad part is, it's harder to savor a coffee when you're taking it on the road."", '01:04': ""The first patent for a lid on a cup was in 1934, but it was for cold beverages. And in 1950, this guy named James Reifsnyder invented the first snap-on lid. But it didn't have an opening for drinking."", '01:18': ""In the '60s there was this huge cultural shift, where people started drinking coffee on the move. And 7-Eleven was the first to sell coffee to go. And then came this revolution in 1967. A man named Alan Frank invented a lid that you could peel a tab off, like in the shape of a guitar pick, and drink it from there. In 1975, another big advance: you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself. So, more and more people started drinking coffee on the go."", '01:49': ""In 1984, a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids: the birth of the traveler lid. And it is iconic -- you've seen it a million times. And it solved a whole host of problems. It's designed so that you don't splash your face, because it's higher than any of the other ones. And it's got this protruding rim, so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips. It's got a small depression in the center for your nose, so you can really get in there and get maximum aroma. It's got this tiny air hole that lets the steam out and stops it from creating a vacuum."", '02:28': ""This is one of those objects where you just don't notice it until it dribbles on your lap. So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve, and you're going to see a move away from single-use plastic lids to lids that are a little more sustainable. We're not going to stop moving. We're not going to stop drinking coffee. And I think that's what these coffee lid engineers are trying to do, is to make it so that the experience of taking it on the road is as good as sitting in a restaurant, drinking from a ceramic cup. Because, you know, coffee is serious business.""}"

In fact, they’re all based on yet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, and we can’t live without.', '00:37': 'Taking a step back, the reason there are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances with a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring or synthetic, but what all steroids have in common is a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings made of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons and one pentagon. A molecule must contain this exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically impact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name from the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids out of cholesterol.', '01:26': 'That fatty cholesterol base means that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes and enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly influence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types of signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects from outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects faster than those other molecules.', '01:57': 'Back to the steroids in anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally occurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s primary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, to spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, and release some constantly. But when they receive the signal from the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate more glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately related to survival, like digestion, and can activate a fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, but can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood if they last too long. Cortisol also interacts with the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease certain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system often creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s ability to produce inflammation, which, again, can be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol can have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels from staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal that causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol.', '03:41': 'Medicinal corticosteroids channel cortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, rashes, and asthma. All these things are forms of inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids that share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down the hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells and can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression of inflammatory signals.', '04:14': 'The steroids in inhalers and creams impact only the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used to treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, impact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s immune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant asthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade immune response under control— but because of the negative psychological and physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved for emergencies and flare-ups.', '04:57': 'While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, and irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, they all have something in common: an immune response that’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids won’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense against itself.'}"

I was afraid of lightning, insects, loud noises and costumed characters. I also had two very severe phobias of doctors and injections. During my struggles to escape from our family doctor, I would become so physically combative that he actually slapped me in the face to stun me. I was six. I was all fight-or-flight back then, and holding me down for a simple vaccine took three or four adults, including my parents.', '00:42': 'Later, our family moved from New York to Florida just as I was starting high school, and being the new kid at the parochial school, not knowing anyone and being worried about fitting in, on the very first day of school, a teacher takes roll and calls out ""Anne Marie Albano,"" to which I respond, [In a Staten Island accent] ""Here!"" She laughs and says, ""Oh, precious, stand up. Say D-O-G."" And I respond, [In a Staten Island accent] ""Dog?"" The class broke out in laughter along with the teacher.

I did not want to go back to that school again. No way.', '01:33': 'My parents listened and told me that they would investigate with the monsignor back in New York, but that I had to keep going in each day so I\'d have the attendance record to transfer to ninth grade on Staten Island. All of this was before email and cell phones, so over the next several weeks, supposedly, there were letters being sent between the Archdiocese of Manhattan and Miami and with the Vatican, and each day, I\'d go into school crying and come home crying, to which my mother would give me an update from some cardinal or bishop to ""Keep her going to school while we find her a spot.""', '02:17': 'Was I naive or what?', '02:19': '(Laughter)', '02:20': 'Well, after a couple of weeks, one day, while waiting for the school bus, I met a girl named Debbie, and she introduced me to her friends. And they became my friends, and, well, the Pope was off the hook.', '02:34': '(Laughter)', '02:35': 'I began to calm down and settle in.', '02:39': ""My past three decades of studying anxiety in children stems partly from my own search for self-understanding. And I've learned much. For young people, anxiety is the most common childhood psychiatric condition. These disorders start early, by age four, and by adolescence, one in 12 youths are severely impaired in their ability to function at home, in school and with peers. These kids are so frightened, worried, literally physically uncomfortable due to their anxiety. It's difficult for them to pay attention in school, relax and have fun, make friends and do all the things that kids should be doing. Anxiety can create misery for the child, and the parents are front and center in witnessing their child's distress."", '03:40': 'As I met more and more children with anxiety through my work, I had to go back to mom and dad and ask them a couple of questions. ""Why did you hold me down when I was so frightened of getting injections and force them on me? And why tell me these tall tales to make me go to school when I was so worried about being embarrassed again?"" They said, ""Our hearts broke for you each time, but we knew that these were things that you had to do. We had to risk you becoming upset while we waited for you to get used to the situation with time and with more experience. You had to get vaccinated. You had to go to school.""', '04:27': ""Little did my parents know, but they were doing more than inoculating me from the measles. They were also inoculating me from a lifetime of anxiety disorders. Excessive anxiety in a young child is like a superbug -- and infectious, even multiplying, such that many of the youth that I see come in with more than one anxiety condition occurring at the same time. For example, they'll have specific phobia plus separation anxiety plus social anxiety all together. Left untreated, anxiety in early childhood can lead to depression by adolescence. It can also contribute to substance abuse and to suicidality."", '05:16': ""My parents were not therapists. They didn't know any psychologists. All they knew is that these situations may have been uncomfortable for me, but they were not harmful. My excessive anxiety would harm me more over the long term if they let me avoid and escape these situations and not learn how to tolerate occasional distress. So in essence, mom and dad were doing their own homegrown version of exposure therapy, which is the central and key component of cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety."", '05:55': 'My colleagues and I conducted the largest randomized controlled study of the treatments of anxiety in children ages seven to 17. We found that child-focused cognitive behavioral exposure therapy or medication with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor are effective for 60 percent of treated youth. And their combination gets 80 percent of kids well within three months. This is all good news. And if they stay on the medication or do monthly exposure treatments as we did in the length of the study, they could stay well for upwards of a year. However, after this treatment study ended, we went back and a did a follow-up study of the participants, and we found that many of these kids relapsed over time. And, despite the best of evidence-based treatments, we also found that for about 40 percent of the kids with anxiety, they remained ill throughout the course of the time.', '07:01': ""We've thought a lot about these results. What were we missing? We've hypothesized that because we were focusing on just child-focused intervention, perhaps there's something important about addressing the parents and involving them in treatment, too."", '07:24': 'Studies from my own lab and from colleagues around the world have shown a consistent trend: well-meaning parents are often inadvertently drawn into the cycle of anxiety. They give in, and they make too many accommodations for their child, and they let their children escape challenging situations. I want you to think about it like this: Your child comes into the house to you crying, in tears. They\'re five or six years of age. ""Nobody at school likes me! These kids are mean. No one would play with me."" How do you feel seeing your child so upset? What do you do? The natural parenting instinct is to comfort that child, soothe them, protect them and fix the situation. Calling the teacher to intervene or the other parents to arrange playdates, that may be fine at age five. But what do you do if your child keeps coming home day after day in tears? Do you still fix things for them at age eight, 10, 14? For children, as they are developing, they invariably are going to be encountering challenging situations: sleepovers, oral reports, a challenging test that pops up, trying out for a sports team or a spot in the school play, conflicts with peers ... All these situations involve risk: risk of not doing well, not getting what they want, risk of maybe making mistakes or being embarrassed.', '09:06': ""For kids with anxiety who don't take risks and engage, they then don't learn how to manage these types of situations. Right? Because skills develop with exposure over time, repeated exposure to everyday situations that kids encounter: self-soothing skills or the ability to calm oneself down when upset; problem-solving skills, including the ability to resolve conflicts with others; delay of gratification, or the ability to keep your efforts going despite the fact that you have to wait over time to see what happens. These and many other skills are developing in children who take risks and engage. And self-efficacy takes shape, which, simply put, is the belief in oneself that you can overcome challenging situations."", '10:05': ""For kids with anxiety who escape and avoid these situations and get other people to do them for them, they become more and more anxious with time while less confident in themselves. Contrary to their peers who don't suffer with anxiety, they come to believe that they are incapable of managing these situations. They think that they need someone, someone like their parents, to do things for them."", '10:36': 'Now, while the natural parenting instinct is to comfort and protect and reassure kids, in 1930, the psychiatrist Alfred Adler had already cautioned parents that we can love a child as much as we wish, but we must not make that child dependent. He advised parents to begin training kids from the very beginning to stand on their own two feet. He also cautioned that if children get the impression that their parents have nothing better to do than be at their beck and call, they would gain a false idea of love.', '11:17': ""For children with anxiety in this day and age, they are always calling their parents or texting distress calls at all hours of the day and night. So if children with anxiety don't learn the proper coping mechanisms when young, what happens to them when they grow up?"", '11:37': ""I run groups for parents of young adults with anxiety disorders. These youth are between the ages of 18 and 28. They are mostly living at home, dependent on their parents. Many of them may have attended school and college. Some have graduated. Almost all are not working, just staying at home and not doing much of anything. They don't have meaningful relationships with others, and they are very, very dependent on their parents to do all sort of things for them. Their parents still make their doctors appointments for them. They call the kids' old friends and beg them to come visit. They do the kids' laundry and cook for them. And they are in great conflict with their young adult, because the anxiety has flourished but the youth has not. These parents feel enormous guilt, but then resentment, and then more guilt."", '12:41': 'OK, how about some good news? If parents and key figures in a child\'s life can help the child, assist them to confront their fears and learn how to problem-solve, then it is more likely that the children are going to develop their own internal coping mechanisms for managing their anxiety. We teach parents now to be mindful in the moment and think about their reaction to their child\'s anxiety. We ask them, ""Look at the situation and ask, \'What is this situation at hand? How threatening is it to my child? And what do I ultimately want them to learn from it?\'""', '13:25': ""Now of course, we want parents to listen very carefully, because if a child is being bullied seriously or put in harm's way, we want parents to intervene, absolutely. But in typical, everyday anxiety-producing situations, parents can be most helpful to their child if they remain calm and matter-of-fact and warm, if they validate the child's feelings but then help the child, assist them in planning how the child is going to manage the situation. And then -- this is key -- to actually have the child deal with the situation themselves."", '14:03': ""Of course, it is heartbreaking to watch a child suffer, as my parents told me years later. When you see your child suffering but you think you could swoop in and save them from the pain of it, that's everything, right? That's what we want to do. But whether we are young or old, excessive anxiety leads us to overestimate risk and distress while underestimating our ability to cope. We know that repeated exposure to what we fear weakens anxiety, while building resources and resilience."", '14:45': ""My parents were on to something. Today's hyper-anxious youth are not being helped by overly protective parenting. Calmness and confidence are not just emotions. They are coping skills that parents and children can learn."", '15:04': 'Thank you.', '15:05': '(Applause)'}"

Susan Shaw shows evidence it's sparing some beaches only at devastating cost to the health of the deep sea.",00:16:28,16.466666666666665,235380,2016-04-22T22:03:41+00:00,"['TEDx', 'business', 'chemistry', 'disaster relief', 'environment', 'fish', 'oceans', 'oil', 'science']","['Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Русский', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Susan Shaw,Marine toxicologist,"{'00:09': ""I am a marine toxicologist, and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf, particularly about the massive applications of the toxic dispersants, the Corexits. I've been working on ocean pollution for quite a long time -- the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts on marine mammals. As it turns out, marine mammals are at the top of this food chain that we're pouring millions of tons of toxic substances into every year. And they are showing the signs of this. I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this, but not everything is all that happy, especially in my work. They are loaded with toxic chemicals in their body, hundreds of compounds, all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering. And they're dying off rather regularly, tens of thousands around the world. It's predicted they may go extinct -- about a third of them -- within about 30 years."", '01:12': ""So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic. It's called Seals as Sentinels. We're tracking pollution at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish. It's a region-wide, eco-toxicological investigation. We're looking at a lot of compounds, but recently been quite interested in the flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants that are in many, many things that we use in our everyday life, from the cushions in the chairs we're all sitting on to the plastic casings of our computers, our television sets and so on. So we are tracking how do these things get from the products into the ocean, which is the final sink for them. And there's quite a complicated pathway for that because, as these products age, they get concentrated in dust, and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills. They wind up in waste water treatment plants. As you all know, we throw out billions of computers and TVs every year. And those go to e-waste dumps. And all that gets into surface waters, eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink. So, in our study, we did find quite high levels, as we expected, of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies. And we reported this. It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant called Deca in Maine, where I am based, and also then a phase-out, U.S.-wide, at the end of last year. But we said, well, on the bright side, our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon."", '02:47': 'So then I got really curious, myself, as a toxicologist, and I donated some blood to my lab and said, ""Okay, let\'s do it."" Well, we detected 113 different compounds in my blood. And I must say, if any of you would have this done, you\'d probably find a similar profile, or cocktail, as they call it. But I was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason. And just to point out the levels -- Americans have 10 to 40 times higher levels of these compounds in our bodies than the Europeans. Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything, and we have weak regulations for toxic chemicals. But lo and behold, I\'m one of the high-end individuals. Lucky me. But then I thought, well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.', '03:40': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""So anyway, here's the problem -- and it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today -- we're not regulating chemicals in this country properly. We're hardly regulating them at all. And we're letting industry run the show. And Jackie Savitz spoke this morning about Big Oil and the propaganda and how we're all brainwashed with their, you know, lies and so forth. Well, Big Chemical is what we're dealing with here. And they're allowed to keep trade secrets, so they don't even give the ingredients out. Plus they don't give health and safety data, so, consequently, they cannot be regulated before they go to market. So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is not on the producer."", '04:31': ""So I then was invited to go to the Gulf in May. I went down there on a preliminary investigation to look into dispersants and how they're going into the water column and so forth. And I was told that I was the only toxicologist to date who was dumb enough to get into the water, but I did. And we dove in the slick without even HazMat gear. And I did get sick. I got a ferocious sore throat two days later. I felt like my throat was on fire. But it did pass. And what I did see in the water as we went down, what really shocked me -- and it's haunted me ever since -- because I could see the droplets of oil dispersing. And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton, bumping into, you know, little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores, the herring kind of fish. And you could just see the web of death as you go down in the water column."", '05:34': ""Well, you know, we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off, they say, between the wetlands versus the ocean depth. And I didn't agree with that decision at the time; I still don't. The decision was to protect the marshes. When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out. And as you know, there's been a very weak response, up until recently, to actually collect the oil. It's gotten much more aggressive. This is an Exxon slide showing what happens, the scenario and the trade-off. So this shows oil on the surface. You can see it getting up into the mangrove, but it is not harming the corals or the sea grass, right. So here we have the other scenario. If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals are getting hit pretty hard, but you're saving the mangrove. So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay? Is it better with one or two?"", '06:31': '(Laughter)', '06:33': ""The problem is that we have released so darn much of this stuff, we're climbing up to two million gallons very quickly. And then there's the problem of the plumes. What plumes? It turns out there are plumes. Independent researchers found that. And then there's the looming, messy problem of human health, reported human health effects. And actually, one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress. So ... Having been in that water just for the short time I was there, I can tell you, it is not heat stress. There are volumes of volatile petroleum fumes coming off that water, plus the Corexit, which has solvent in it. So it is not at all rational."", '07:25': ""So what do we have? The BP show is going on. Our officials complained about Corexit, which is the most toxic line of dispersants. But heck, they're still using it, and they used the most toxic one, the 9527, until they ran out of supplies. Now they're on 9500. 9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it that causes internal bleeding. We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way. So what we're doing, we're putting compounds with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill. Does this make sense? So this is the way it works. And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here. It's a micelle. Micelles form around the oil. And what happens first is the solvents break into the oil, the lipid membrane, they let the surfactants in there. The surfactants -- which are like things we use on fast food wrappers -- they grab around the droplets of oil, and they make little, tiny droplets with nice, little surfactant edges to them. The thing to remember about the micelles -- these little floating globules of toxin -- is they are there to deliver. They're like the FedEx guys. And if you're a fish, and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning, you're going to get it in the afternoon, because they've got your number."", '08:52': ""So from a toxicology perspective, this is really awful because Corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone. And usually the exposure is a combined exposure. The dispersants -- as I was saying -- their job is to break down the lipid membrane. The solvents in them do that very efficiently. So they break down lipid membranes in our body, starting with cells of the skin, the cells of organs. So it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily. Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds that are toxic to every organ in the body. And so with the dispersants combined, you have this very synergistic combined toxicity. Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds. And I'm part of a chat group, which is a national group of toxicologists and chemists that are, you know, basically turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff, and what is it doing and what are the interactions of these chemicals, most of which we don't know, and what are their byproducts, which are usually more toxic than the parent compound. So we did find that Corexit 9500 contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium -- arsenic at high enough levels to have cancer-causing effects."", '10:27': ""So this is what we have to look at, these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets, which have nothing on them much. And now they were forced to release the ultimate list of everything that's in Corexit. And guess what, tons of stuff is missing. Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups of many, many compounds, these sorbitans. And then you get down to the petroleum distillates, which are the solvents, hundreds of them. They are not identified. And why? Trade secrets again. BP's running the show, and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do. So far these ingredients have not been released, and toxicologists are actually going nuts because we cannot predict with certainty what the interactions and toxic results are going to be."", '11:21': ""But we do have quite a lot at risk down there, as we all know, the 33 wildlife refuges, so much wildlife and fish and diversity. So we know from previous spills. And then part of this is just part of my bad dreams. And I appreciate being able to vent some of my anguish upon you. What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard. And this is a study that was done on the Australian coast, the coast of Tasmania. Corals are, you know, the home to about a quarter of all marine species. And with the Corexit and the oil, there's zero percent fertilization. With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization. So they're a very sensitive species to this combo."", '12:14': ""Here's another group. I could see myself easily in the water column. The plankton and the plankton eaters, you know, these are the little herring fish that go through the water column with their mouths open, feeding indiscriminately and just lapping up this brown pudding of toxic stuff. And we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture. See the oil and Corexit is causing death at a much, much lower dose than oil alone. That's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects. But my bad dreams go like this. The piscivorous fish, the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish, also the tuna and sharks, are going to hit by this. And the gills are quite sensitive. The respiratory system is very sensitive. Think about it with the Corexit hitting the membranes, and it will clog up the gills, and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemical pneumonia, trying to aspirate the compounds. It also will cause internal bleeding upon ingestion. I'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them, but also, the way their going to be exposed is every time they come to the surface to take a breath, they're going to inhale these volatile fumes. And what does happen with that eventually is pneumonia sets in and liver, kidney, brain damage. The Corexit is transporting the oil into every membrane and every system of the body. And you're having a lot of different unpleasant effects, but burns to the eyes and mouth, skin ulcers, lesions. And I think, personally, that we have not begun to see the impacts of this spill on the wildlife of the Gulf."", '14:11': ""We started hypothesizing: what do we know? what do with think would be a trophic cascade? which means that somebody gets wiped out, and then everything above that's eating those guys will crash. So our thought was -- this is a simple thinking process, but ... obviously the plankton, the planktivores, and that's about as far as we got. And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out. This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen, this trophic cascade where you lose the kelp and the herring and other fishes and going up. They thought that eventually the killer whale would be at the top of this cascade. And then here's what really happened, much more complicated, much more specific. Actually the kelp and the barnacles that attach to the rock were decimated by the combination of Corexit and the oil. They were replaced by invasive species, which had less holding power to the rock. Storms came along. They ripped out of the rock. And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks. And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks from the Exxon Valdez spill, and they haven't come back."", '15:26': ""So we are launching an independent study. And by independent, I do not mean alone; I mean independent in the sense of not tied to the kind of crime-scene secrecy that's going on in the Gulf now. But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts, but we need lots and lots of partners to do this intelligently. We have some of the partners lined up. And Dave Gallo signed on. Sylvia's in here. And we hope that some of you will help us. My question to you is: why shouldn't we know? Don't we have the right to know? Surely we have the right to learn what loss we are going through in the Gulf. And my wish would be -- for the gulf prize -- would be that we have the truth. Whatever it is, please let us have the truth. And to get there, we need to do the assessment."", '16:25': 'So I appreciate being here. Thank you.', '16:27': '(Applause)'}"

But the recurring answer from producers was I was not Kenyan enough. Meaning what? I didn't sing fully in the slang derivative of Kiswahili and I didn't sing enough party tracks, so they said Kenyans wouldn't listen to a Kenyan who sounded like me. This idea of otherism, the exclusion of a person based on their perceived deviation from the norms, goes to the root of the problems in Kenya. And it runs deep."", '00:40': ""Kenya was invented by colonialists in 1895, and with it, came the erasure of our identity and the class system built on otherism. So by 1963, when we received our independence, these ideas had already become the new normal. Now, we've tried a lot of different ways to move forward since. We have a common language, currency, infrastructure, basically all the things that make a country a country. But all these efforts at nation-building do not go to the heart of the matter. Which is this: we cannot build what we do not truly love. And we cannot love until we love ourselves. The thing we have to heal, us Kenyans, is our lack of self-love, our deep self-hate and our existential identity crisis. And this is the work of nation-building that only the creative industry can do."", '01:32': ""The idea that Kenya can only include some of us led me to found a music festival in 2008 called Blankets and Wine, to give a platform to myself and other misfits. Ten years later, we've programmed over 200 bands and put at least 100,000 dollars directly into the hands of artists and managers, who have in turn spent it on technicians, rehearsals, music videos and other things along the music value chain. Our platform has allowed for multiple Kenyan identities to exist, while inspiring the industry to discover and engage the wide variety of Kenyan music. What we do is necessary but insufficient. And we must urgently pivot into a live music circuit."", '02:14': 'But there are other ways music can help heal the nation. According to a 2018 state of media report, traditional radio is sill by far the biggest distributor of ideas in Kenya, with 47 percent of Kenyans still choosing radio first. This presents an opportunity. We can use radio to help Kenyans hear the diversity that is Kenya. We can reserve 60 percent of all programing on Kenyan radio for Kenyan music. We can break down ethnic barriers by playing Kenyan music done in English, Kiswahili and other ethnic languages, on what is now single-language ethnic radio. Radio can help stimulate interest and demand for Kenyan music by Kenyans, while also providing the much-needed incomes by way of royalties. But more importantly, radio can help us build a more inclusive narrative about Kenya. For you cannot love what you do not know exists.', '03:12': ""Other creative industries too can do the work. When you consider that 41 percent of Kenyans still choose TV as their primary medium, it's obvious that film has a huge potential. The meager resources that have been put into the sector have already produced world-class acts, like Lupita Nyong'o and Wanuri Kahiu, but we are going to need a lot more incentives and investments to make filming in Kenya easier, so more Kenyan stories can get on the Kenyan TV and spark off the really difficult conversations we need to have with one another. We're going to need to grow a lot more home-grown stars, so we can reverse the idea that we have to blow up abroad before we get the acceptance and validation of home."", '03:56': ""Fashion too can do the work. We need to make it possible to affordably mass-produce Kenyan clothes for Kenyan consumers, so we don't all have to rely on second-hand imports. The first running shoe made in Kenya needs to be a local and global success as an ode to Kenyan excellence, epitomized by Kenyan runners, who are literally world-class. For these ideas to come to life, jobs will be created, and Kenyan ideas will be exported. But more importantly, Kenyans may finally consider themselves worthy of the love that we reserve for others."", '04:34': ""Kenya's creative industry is dynamic, cosmopolitan, forward-looking, and without a doubt, a true manufacturing industry of the immediate future. But its true power lies in its ability to help heal the psyche of Kenya, so we can finally build a nation for real."", '04:54': 'Thank you.', '04:55': '(Applause)', '05:01': '(Applause)', '05:03': ""For this song, I'd like us all to take a minute and think about immigrant communities, and especially refugee immigrant communities, and the daily struggle they have to endure, building a life with dignity and meaning away from everything they have loved and known.

I'm a sign-language interpreter that specializes in music interpreting. And you're probably wondering why Deaf people would attend concerts, but actually, music is so much more than sound simply traveling through the ear. See, Deaf people experience music, just in a different way. For example, my friend Lisa, she cuts her hair a certain length, so she feels the vibrations of sound in the music. And music has psychological effects on us. It invokes feelings of nostalgia, happiness, sadness, falling in love. It makes you have a feeling of connectedness, and unfortunately, Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are excluded from these events, because obtaining a sign-language interpreter is so difficult and so overwhelming that they simply don't buy the tickets or they just give up, and this is not OK. We have to make everything accessible."", '01:11': ""So, myself, I am a sign-language interpreter, so what I have to do is I have to take music and bring it to life. In doing that, I become a bridge between the hearing world and the Deaf world, making sure that I'm representing music and the artistry of what music represents. Now, this is a lot of work, OK? For a regular set that might be 12 songs, myself and a team, we have to study over 30 songs or more for one set and hope and pray we have the right setlist."", '01:46': ""But you know what? You know what the reward is? Looking down in the audience and seeing Deaf and hard-of-hearing members, all of those people dancing and jamming out and feeling included in that music experience. For myself, I'm a part of this cultural and linguistic community, and we all communicate in different ways. Some of us sign and voice, some of us just sign, but no one way is superior to the other."", '02:16': ""But you know what?

But it was only until three years ago, when I ran the London Marathon bleeding freely on my cycle to combat the global menstrual stigma that women face every day all around the world, that I realized that I have a message, and that the most effective way that I can convey my message was through my music."", '07:32': 'And why music? Because music caters to the emotions. Music is joyful. Music pulls you in with the beat and the rhythm and the melodies. The music pulls you in via the community aspect of it.

In the music I listen to today, sometimes I\'m like, wow, I love the rhythm so much, but the message is so misogynist, it\'s tough to work out to our run to or do whatever it is that I\'m trying to do.

The doctor will soon inject its contents into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer using a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon for the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in a particle accelerator, just hours earlier.', '00:50': 'The particle accelerator in question is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles like protons faster and faster along a spiraling path. When the protons reach their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking to get the scan done.', '01:44': 'So how can fluorine-18 be used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia.', '02:13': ""The FDG is now ready for the patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain, cancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner."", '02:43': 'The radiation that the tracer emits is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay by positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons with positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls. The software in the scanner uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the tracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for.', '03:58': 'But with all this talk of radiation and nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks are acceptable for the chance to diagnose and treat their illnesses.'}"

Well, it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure: it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out -- that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past, a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years, if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times since I was born. When you have a new baby, by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented, and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part."", '01:23': ""Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets -- versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just -- these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc., in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance? Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning, the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle -- that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years: it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans, are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it."", '02:39': ""Now, the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same -- (Laughter) -- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans-versus-nature; we've won, there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into, that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. -- they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed, transported, housed and so on. And the information technology, which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity? It's just going up through the roof. And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with."", '04:10': ""So, that's the stage out of all this. I find, for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words, the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable; economically, it's achievable; politically, it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual -- and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills, somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school, which is putting information and dogma into them, get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book, think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time -- it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient -- which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy, less material. Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power, and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc."", '06:12': ""Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in 1976 and 77, winning the Kremer prize in aviation history, followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land, in the air, on water -- vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same, whether its land, air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane -- 165 miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors -- the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars, what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact, they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product."", '07:40': 'With that preamble, let\'s show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously, and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere -- an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet. (Music) The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world\'s energy future. In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England, solely on the power of sunbeams, and established a basis for the Pathfinder. (Music) The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: ""there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less.""', '09:48': ""Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort, and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span -- and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night, and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time. (Music) Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home. The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts -- (Music) this is starting -- made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere, the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is -- probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite, because it can stay right overhead for months at a time, 2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you."", '12:14': ""But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams, his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces -- that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it, the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope, with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan, just any time you're -- all right -- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan: It's switched on. PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK: Can you bring up the house lights? PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. (Applause) PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it -- there it goes. Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you, it will not hurt you. (Laughter) OK. (Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)"", '14:52': ""But now, as they say in infomercials, we have something much better for you, which we're working on: planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month, showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it, but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK, here we go. (Laughter) MK: Sorry. OK. (Applause) PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think -- I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually. (Laughter) But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA."", '16:22': ""Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know. But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology, you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake, you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature, for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects."", '17:04': ""In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species, no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom; we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?"", '17:53': ""Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one -- tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems, and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there, but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years. Things are going on this decade, next decade; it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age -- I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning, not a forecast. That was before -- I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted? I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based. And so where it all goes, I don't know."", '19:31': ""The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle, which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that -- rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you. MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram. PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin. And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it. So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. (Applause) And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been -- (Laughter) (Applause) Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down, but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there -- (Laughter) -- than it ever had. And I wanted to make -- (Applause) just -- (Applause)"", '21:23': ""But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous; there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago -- there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor, there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger, there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate on zero-emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time, probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams, like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that, as a symbol, it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature, and puts it all together in things that are -- that make this conference, I think, more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you. (Applause)""}"

Like walking on water, like flying. I think it's really about being one with a natural phenomenon."", '00:16': '[Small thing. Big idea.]', '00:21': ""The surfboard requires a lot of ergonomic thinking. How do I stand on it? How do I not slip off? But at the same time, it really has to work in that fluid environment. It's really considered for the rider in some areas and for water and physics in others."", '00:36': ""A surfboard is made out of a core element which tends to be foam, which makes the board float, and the skin of the board is some kind of resin, epoxy, sometimes fiberglass. There often is also a stringer, a wood piece down the middle, which makes it stronger. The rocker is the curvature of the board in the front. That is important because that determines what kind of wave you will be able to take, how steep the wave is. The tail affects performance. Different tails will make the board react differently, so it's a lot about personal preference."", '01:09': ""Our understanding of surfing comes from when the Tahitians in 1200 AD brought it to Hawaii. So when James Cook arrived around 1780, he was mesmerized by hundreds of people in the water, children, women, men, surfing naked. Calvinist missionaries arrive and they're scandalized by it. It becomes an illegal activity. It becomes counterculture."", '01:33': 'The father of modern surfing is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku. He is an extraordinary swimmer, wins gold at the Olympics in 1912. Goes around the world to show his swimming but brings surfboards and demonstrates surfing. Imagine, people had never seen surfing before. Suddenly, some person from a faraway place is standing on water, riding on water.', '01:55': ""He comes back to Hawaii, and they start to make more boards. Pre-Second World War, you're still looking at big, heavy wood boards. Post-Second World War, new materials and new technologies become available, and those make the board lighter, more accessible, cheaper, but it continues to be a custom object, something that is made specifically for a person or for a certain spot."", '02:17': ""It's a very symbiotic relationship between surfer and shaper. There's so many different criteria that affect the physics of how that surfboard is moving in water."", '02:28': 'A longboard is typically used on smaller waves. The riding has a lot of style. You can walk the board, put your toes over it, do a hang ten.', '02:37': ""A shortboard will be faster. They're harder to ride, they sink under the body. Board design comes at the intersection between those physical factors, and really, how I want to put myself in the water. It's an expression as much as it is a physical activity. The draw may be because water is so elusive. You can't fight it, you can't change it."", '02:59': ""The best I can do is recognize what it does. The surf may be big and getting bigger and surging while you're in the water. The elements are changing. The wind is coming up. You have to be in symbiosis with the environment. You need to look and feel for everything that's happening around you. And yet, it's so short. Five, eight, 15 seconds. It's fleeting, but you have to go back to it.""}"

The writer blamed their deaths on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed on a nearby marsh.', '00:25': 'The letter was the push Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries through government contacts from her years working in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced the voices of spring?”', '00:51': 'In 1962, Carson published her findings in ""Silent Spring."" Her book documented the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature and human health. ""Silent Spring"" immediately drew both applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist and writer ignite such controversy?', '01:16': 'Carson began her career as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father and sister. Carson found part time work with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, and in 1936, she became the second woman to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated with a wide audience.', '02:02': 'In ""Silent Spring,"" Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants.', '02:35': 'In spite of this and other mishaps, the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences for future generations.', '03:19': 'The response to ""Silent Spring"" was explosive. For many people the book was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.”', '04:01': 'In reality, Carson had focused on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, but of ourselves.”', '04:22': 'Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after the publication of ""Silent Spring."" Her work galvanized a generation of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure from environmentalists, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact of her writing.'}"

You can hold it in your hand and watch the little needle bounce around until you find north."", '00:44': 'Magnetism is still a pretty mysterious force to physicists, but what we do know for sure is that a compass works because the Earth is this giant magnet. And when you use a compass, you are in touch with the very center of our planet, where this kind of roiling ball of molten iron is spinning around and creating a magnetic field. Just like a magnet you can play with on your tabletop, it has a north pole and a south pole, and we use compasses to find our way north because of that fact.', '01:14': 'The earliest known compass comes from about 200 BC in China. They figured out that some of the metal coming out of the ground was naturally magnetic, and so they fashioned this magnetized metal into this kind of ladle-looking thing, put it on a brass plate and then it would point north. It seems to have been primarily used to improve feng shui, so they could figure out what was the best way for energy to flow through their living spaces.', '01:40': 'Sailors were probably the early adopters of the more portable versions of it, because no matter where the sun was, no matter what the condition of the stars were, they would always be able to find north.', '01:51': ""Now, much later, the Europeans are the ones who innovate and come up with the compass rose. It essentially laid out what north, south, east and west looked like, and it also enabled you to kind of create new directions, like northwest, southeast, what have you. And for the first time, they knew where they were going. That's kind of a big deal."", '02:11': 'But also, I think it was part of this general reinvigoration of European science. You might know it as the Renaissance. Lots of new tools were invented, from the telescope to the microscope.', '02:22': 'Maps got better because of compasses, right? Because then you start to understand which direction is which, you get a lot more detail, and that just kind of changes the human relationship to the world. The compass with a map is like a superpower. Everything that we think of as world history would not have taken place without the compass: the age of exploration, Magellan circumnavigating the globe, even the fact that we know it is a globe.', '02:47': ""The compass ends up getting embedded in all these other tools, because it is such a functional object. So you might have it embedded in your multi-tool, you might have it embedded in your phone. The compass is everywhere, because it's literally how we find our way across the face of the Earth.

This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe. Every time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them. So one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers, ""The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they\'ll be here."" So people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out. But there were two men: one man was blind, one man had no legs -- he was born like that. The leader of the chiefs said, ""No, sorry. We can\'t take you. You\'ll slow us down. We have to flee our women and children, we have to run."" And they were left behind, waiting to die.', '02:19': 'But these two people worked something out.

The man with no legs says, ""I can see as far as the end of the world, but I can\'t save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."" The blind man went down on his knees like this, and told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up. The man on top can see, the blind man can walk.

I represent Northern Kenya: the most nomadic, remote areas you can even find. And that man told me, ""So, here you are.

The truth is that our consumption and disposal of plastic has reached such unsustainable proportions that we need to address this using every idea and resource at hand.', '00:27': ""Please welcome someone who's helping solve India's waste management issues, Mani Vajipey, recycler and cofounder/CEO of Banyan Nation."", '00:38': '(Applause)', '00:45': ""Mani Vajipey: If recycling were an Olympic sport, India would win the gold medal. India has one of the highest rates of plastic recycling and recovery in the entire world. Higher than the likes of Singapore, countries in North America and even countries in Europe. India recovers and recycles over 60 percent of its plastic waste, whereas a developed country, like United States, manages just about 10 percent. This high rate of collection is largely possible thanks to the millions of informal recyclers, the kabadiwalas, the bhandiwallas and the raddiwalas that we find at every street corner across every city in India. And yet, in spite of such a ubiquitous, extensive and intricate network of recyclers, India's national scenery is dominated by filth and squalor. And the general perception is that we don't recycle our plastics."", '01:44': ""The other thing about plastics in India is that any product made from recycled plastic is considered to be substandard and we expect it to be cheaper as well. What we don't realize is there are several types of plastics in their virgin and pure form, if recycled scientifically, can be recycled several times over without any compromise in quality. If we can recover and reuse our discarded plastic, then we save a significant amount of virgin plastic that we would have otherwise produced and consumed. And this is very important, because virgin plastic is made from fossil fuels that are an exhaustible resource. The more virgin plastic we produce and consume, the more plastic waste we have to manage."", '02:32': ""Mismanagement of plastic waste leads to the leakage of such materials into our water bodies. It's now common knowledge that by the year 2050 we'll have more plastics in our oceans than fish."", '02:46': ""About seven years ago, my friend and cofounder Raj and I, we decided that we were going to focus on solving this massive problem. We went around the city of Hyderabad, talking to local recyclers. Very soon, we found out that there were many recyclers just in Hyderabad alone. We soon realized that the plastic recycling industry of today is not very different from the milk industry of the '60s and '70s. Milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers, with two or three cows or buffalos, who produce five to ten liters of milk a day. Instead of blindly aping solutions from the West, India championed the milk cooperative model, where thousands of such small-scale recyclers were brought together into groups. With scale came innovations and investments. India was transformed from a milk-deficit nation to the world's leading exporter and producer of milk. It dawned upon us that India had in the past solved much larger problems, like milk deficiency. We only need to look back to our past to find inspiration in solving what is perhaps the most fundamental issue of our times, that is plastic pollution."", '04:00': ""But before we could do this, or before brands could use recycled plastic, we had to solve two things. Quality and scale. For us, to make a shampoo bottle from discarded plastics, we had to collect tens of thousands of tons of discarded plastics. For that, we needed data. Raj and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recyclers, giving us a bird's eye view of every recycler in Hyderabad. The results were astounding. There were 2,000 kabadiwalas just in Hyderabad alone. That means, for every square kilometer, there were four kabadiwalas or informal recyclers. No developed country or city in the entire world has the luxury of such a brilliant collection system."", '04:48': '(Applause)', '04:51': ""Once we had the data, the rest was fairly straightforward. We started trading with the informal recyclers, we started training them to segregate the materials based on our quality specifications. In the past five years, we've developed several clusters across South India, comprising of thousands of such informal recyclers, who interact with us both directly and digitally. In parallel, we began working on the problem of quality and purity of material. So in the past five years, we developed a proprietary cleaning technology that allows us to eliminate all contaminants."", '05:26': ""Today, Banyan's recycled granules have undergone stringent quality testing and have been certified by top global FMCG and automotive companies. In the next few months, tens of thousands of discarded plastics collected through informal recycler networks will be converted into high-quality granules and sent away to brands and large companies to make bottles for engine-oil packaging, for shampoo bottles and for lotions. In the next three years, we expect that over 500 million such bottles will be made from our recycled plastics."", '06:05': '(Applause)', '06:09': 'But this is just the beginning. In the next five years, we aspire to build an India where 100 percent of discarded plastics are recycled and repurposed scientifically -- where plastic waste no longer threatens our water bodies, and the very survival of our terrestrial and marine life.', '06:28': ""So the next time you go to a store and pick up a shampoo bottle, see if that bottle uses safe and sustainable recycled plastic. That's not only just going to help the Earth but also reward the street corner recycler for his all-important work. Now that will compel brands to use more and more recycled plastic for their mainstream products and applications."", '06:50': ""Our tradition and our culture has a lot of ancient wisdom. Let's not destroy the only planet we have. The only home we have."", '07:00': 'Thank you.', '07:01': '(Applause)', '07:07': ""SRK: Thank you, Mani. When I was young, I used to -- (sings in Hindi).

For the past several decades, the entire country and the kabadiwalas, and the bhandiwallas, we have been doing that. I'm very positive that in three to five years, you'll wake up, you know that the plastic is being recycled, you're going to pick up a packaging, you know that the package actually has a mark that uses recycled plastics, so I'm super optimistic about this.

He had secured funding from the Norwegian Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the opposite direction.', '00:36': 'By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had been visited and mapped, with only two key locations remaining: the North Pole, deep in the frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to what he called “the last great problem.”', '01:20': 'But Amundsen’s crew weren’t the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted against the Norwegian in what the newspapers called a ‘race to the Pole.’', '01:49': ""Yet if it was a race, it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times from different locations, and they had very different plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of men and more than a hundred dogs.  His explorers were clothed in sealskin and furs, as well as specially designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated.  Launching an extensive scientific research expedition, he traveled with over three times more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies,  they found both their ponies and motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow."", '02:51': ""In the spring of 1911, after waiting out the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains.  They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first at their desolate destination."", '03:27': 'To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed the area in a grid to make sure they covered the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp, two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary, would not be found until spring.', '04:13': 'Today, scientists from various countries  live and work at Antarctic research stations. But the journeys of these early explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates, they are forever joined in history,  and in the name of the research base that marks the South Pole.'}"

In the spring, I'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs. In the summer, I loved the electric glow of fireflies as they would zip around on muggy nights. In the fall, the bogs were brimming with the bright red of cranberries. Even winter had its charms, with the Christmassy bouquet emanating from pine trees. For me, nature has always been a source of wonder and inspiration."", '00:34': ""As I went on to graduate school in chemistry, and in later years, I came to better understand the natural world in molecular detail. All the things that I just mentioned, from the scents of lilacs and pines to the bright red of cranberries and the glow of fireflies, have at least one thing in common: they're manufactured by enzymes."", '00:52': ""As I said, I grew up in Wisconsin, so of course, I like cheese and the Green Bay Packers. But let's talk about cheese for a minute. For at least the last 7,000 years, humans have extracted a mixture of enzymes from the stomachs of cows and sheep and goats and added it to milk. This causes the milk to curdle -- it's part of the cheese-making process. The key enzyme in this mixture is called chymosin. I want to show you how that works."", '01:15': ""Right here, I've got two tubes, and I'm going to add chymosin to one of these. Just a second here. Now my son Anthony, who is eight years old, was very interested in helping me figure out a demo for the TED Talk, and so we were in the kitchen, we were slicing up pineapples, extracting enzymes from red potatoes and doing all kinds of demos in the kitchen. And in the end, though, we thought the chymosin demo was pretty cool. And so what's happening here is the chymosin is swimming around in the milk, and it's binding to a protein there called casein. What it does then is it clips the casein -- it's like a molecular scissors. It's that clipping action that causes the milk to curdle. So here we are in the kitchen, working on this. OK. So let me give this a quick zip. And then we'll set these to the side and let these simmer for a minute. OK."", '02:13': ""If DNA is the blueprint of life, enzymes are the laborers that carry out its instructions. An enzyme is a protein that's a catalyst, it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction, just as the chymosin over here is accelerating the curdling of the milk. But it's not just about cheese. While enzymes do play an important role in the foods that we eat, they also are involved in everything from the health of an infant to attacking the biggest environmental challenges we have today."", '02:39': ""The basic building blocks of enzymes are called amino acids. There are 20 common amino acids, and we typically designate them with single-letter abbreviations, so it's really an alphabet of amino acids. In an enzyme, these amino acids are strung together, like pearls on a necklace. And it's really the identity of the amino acids, which letters are in that necklace, and in what order they are, what they spell out, that gives an enzyme its unique properties and differentiates it from other enzymes. Now, this string of amino acids, this necklace, folds up into a higher-order structure. And if you were to zoom in at the molecular level and take a look at chymosin, which is the enzyme working over here, you would see it looks like this. It's all these strands and loops and helices and twists and turns, and it has to be in just this conformation to work properly."", '03:24': ""Nowadays, we can make enzymes in microbes, and that can be like a bacteria or a yeast, for example. And the way we do this is we get a piece of DNA that codes for an enzyme that we're interested in, we insert that into the microbe, and we let the microbe use its own machinery, its own wherewithal, to produce that enzyme for us. So if you wanted chymosin, you wouldn't need a calf, nowadays -- you could get this from a microbe. And what's even cooler, I think, is we can now dial in completely custom DNA sequences to make whatever enzymes we want, stuff that's not out there in nature. And, to me, what's really the fun part is trying to design an enzyme for a new application, arranging the atoms just so."", '04:02': 'The act of taking an enzyme from nature and playing with those amino acids, tinkering with those letters, putting some letters in, taking some letters out, maybe rearranging them a little bit, is a little bit like finding a book and editing a few chapters or changing the ending. In 2018, the Nobel prize in chemistry was given for the development of this approach, which is known as directed evolution.', '04:25': ""Nowadays, we can harness the powers of directed evolution to design enzymes for custom purposes, and one of these is designing enzymes for doing applications in new areas, like laundry. So just as enzymes in your body can help you to break down the food that you eat, enzymes in your laundry detergent can help you to break down the stains on your clothes. It turns out that about 90 percent of the energy that goes into doing the wash is from water heating. And that's for good reason -- the warmer water helps to get your clothes clean. But what if you were able to do the wash in cold water instead? You certainly would save some money, and in addition to that, according to some calculations done by Procter and Gamble, if all households in the US were to do the laundry in cold water, we would save the emissions of 32 metric tons of CO2 each year. That's a lot, that's about the equivalent of the carbon dioxide emitted by 6.3 million cars."", '05:19': ""So, how would we go about designing an enzyme to realize these changes? Enzymes didn't evolve to clean dirty laundry, much less in cold water. But we can go to nature, and we can find a starting point. We can find an enzyme that has some starting activity, some clay that we can work with. So this is an example of such an enzyme, right here on the screen. And we can start playing with those amino acids, as I said, putting some letters in, taking some letters out, rearranging those. And in doing so, we can generate thousands of enzymes. And we can take those enzymes, and we can test them in little plates like this."", '05:53': ""So this plate that I'm holding in my hands contains 96 wells, and in each well is a piece of fabric with a stain on it. And we can measure how well each of these enzymes are able to remove the stains from the pieces of fabric, and in that way see how well it's working. And we can do this using robotics, like you'll see in just a second on the screen."", '06:16': ""OK, so we do this, and it turns out that some of the enzymes are sort of in the ballpark of the starting enzyme. That's nothing to write home about. Some are worse, so we get rid of those. And then some are better. Those improved ones become our version 1.0s. Those are the enzymes that we want to carry forward, and we can repeat this cycle again and again. And it's the repetition of this cycle that lets us come up with a new enzyme, something that can do what we want. And after several cycles of this, we did come up with something new. So you can go to the supermarket today, and you can buy a laundry detergent that lets you do the wash in cold water because of enzymes like this here. And I want to show you how this one works too."", '06:54': ""So I've got two more tubes here, and these are both milk again. And let me show you, I've got one that I'm going to add this enzyme to and one that I'm going to add some water to. And that's the control, so nothing should happen in that tube. You might find it curious that I'm doing this with milk. But the reason that I'm doing this is because milk is just loaded with proteins, and it's very easy to see this enzyme working in a protein solution, because it's a master protein chopper, that's its job."", '07:24': ""So let me get this in here. And you know, as I said, it's a master protein chopper and what you can do is you can extrapolate what it's doing in this milk to what it would be doing in your laundry. So this is kind of a way to visualize what would be happening. OK, so those both went in. And I'm going to give this a quick zip as well. OK, so we'll let these sit over here with the chymosin sample, so I'm going to come back to those toward the end."", '08:00': ""Well, what's on the horizon for enzyme design? Certainly, it will get it faster -- there are now approaches for evolving enzymes that allow researchers to go through far more samples than I just showed you. And in addition to tinkering with natural enzymes, like we've been talking about, some scientists are now trying to design enzymes from scratch, using machine learning, an approach from artificial intelligence, to inform their enzyme designs. Still others are adding unnatural amino acids to the mix. We talked about the 20 natural amino acids, the common amino acids, before -- they're adding unnatural amino acids to make enzymes with properties unlike those that could be found in nature. That's a pretty neat area."", '08:39': 'How will designed enzymes affect you in years to come? Well, I want to focus on two areas: human health and the environment. Some pharmaceutical companies now have teams that are dedicated to designing enzymes to make drugs more efficiently and with fewer toxic catalysts. For example, Januvia, which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes, is made partially with enzymes. The number of drugs made with enzymes is sure to grow in the future.', '09:08': ""In another area, there are certain disorders in which a single enzyme in a person's body doesn't work properly. An example of this is called phenylketonuria, or PKU for short. People with PKU are unable to properly metabolize or digest phenylalanine, which is one of the 20 common amino acids that we've been talking about. The consequence of ingesting phenylalanine for people with PKU is that they are subject to permanent intellectual disabilities, so it's a scary thing to have. Now, those of you with kids -- do you guys have kids, here, which ones have kids? A lot of you. So may be familiar with PKUs, because all infants in the US are required to be tested for PKU. I remember when Anthony, my son, had his heel pricked to test for it. The big challenge with this is: What do you eat? Phenylalanine is in so many foods, it's incredibly hard to avoid. Now, Anthony has a nut allergy, and I thought that was tough, but PKU's on another level of toughness. However, new enzymes may soon enable PKU patients to eat whatever they want. Recently, the FDA approved an enzyme designed to treat PKU. This is big news for patients, and it's actually very big news for the field of enzyme-replacement therapy more generally, because there are other targets out there where this would be a good approach."", '10:24': ""So that was a little bit about health. Now I'm going to move to the environment. When I read about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- by the way, that's, like, this huge island of plastic, somewhere between California and Hawaii -- and about microplastics pretty much everywhere, it's upsetting. Plastics aren't going away anytime soon. But enzymes may help us in this area as well. Recently, bacteria producing plastic-degrading enzymes were discovered. Efforts are already underway to design improved versions of these enzymes. At the same time, there are enzymes that have been discovered and that are being optimized to make non-petroleum-derived biodegradable plastics."", '11:02': ""Enzymes may also offer some help in capturing greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Now, there is no doubt, these are major challenges, and none of them are easy. But our ability to harness enzymes may help us to tackle these in the future, so I think that's another area to be looking forward."", '11:21': ""So now I'm going to get back to the demo -- this is the fun part. So we'll start with the chymosin samples. So let me get these over here. And you can see here, this is the one that got the water, so nothing should happen to this milk. This is the one that got the chymosin. So you can see that it totally clarified up here. There's all this curdled stuff, that's cheese, we just made cheese in the last few minutes. So this is that reaction that people have been doing for thousands and thousands of years. I'm thinking about doing this one at our next Kids to Work Day demo but they can be a tough crowd, so we'll see."", '11:55': '(Laughter)', '11:56': ""And then the other one I want to look at is this one. So this is the enzyme for doing your laundry. And you can see that it's different than the one that has the water added. It's kind of clarifying, and that's just what you want for an enzyme in your laundry, because you want to be able to have an enzyme that can be a protein chowhound, just chew them up, because you're going to get different protein stains on your clothes, like chocolate milk or grass stains, for example, and something like this is going to help you get them off. And this is also going to be the thing that allows you to do the wash in cold water, reduce your carbon footprint and save you some money."", '12:34': ""Well, we've come a long way, considering this 7,000-year journey from enzymes in cheese making to the present day and enzyme design. We're really at a creative crossroads, and with enzymes, can edit what nature wrote or write our own stories with amino acids."", '12:52': ""So next time you're outdoors on a muggy night and you see a firefly, I hope you think of enzymes.

But when examined through the eye of an evolutionist, our romantic whims and sexual desires can start to make more sense, and even seem a bit predictable. Biological anthropologist David Puts confronts how we compete, care and copulate based on evolutionary biology -- and what that means for our love lives.",,,223647,2019-02-01T23:48:34+00:00,"['science', 'love', 'sex', 'anthropology']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', 'עברית', '中文 (繁體)']",David Puts,Biological anthropologist,"{'0:00': ""Hi there. I could be wrong, but I think this talk may have the distinction of being the one talk in this series that ends with orgasm. (Laughter) But let's not get ahead of ourselves. (Laughter) Have you ever thought about the fact that you're here, alive on this planet because every one of your ancestors reproduced? Every one, in an unbroken chain, all the way back to the first life on this planet, over three and a half billion years ago. That's a lot of reproducing. And for the past billion years, your ancestors reproduced sexually. So sex is a pretty big deal. But you probably knew that. But let's talk about human mating. Why does human mating take the forms that it does? Why are we attracted to certain people? Why do we sometimes form long-term romantic relationships? Why do we sometimes cheat? Now I don't mean why consciously do we do these things. I don't mean what happens in the brain to cause it. I mean, why did we evolve these feelings and these behaviors? In other words, how did the underlying brain structures and brain chemistry contribute to our ancestors' reproductive success so that those traits got passed on into the present generation while others didn't. Answering evolutionary questions like this is like being a crime scene investigator, we're left with the evidence, and we have to try to establish what happened. So let's go back six or seven million years ago to our early ancestors. This is right after the split between our lineage and the lineage that would eventually give rise to chimpanzees. Now these were small brained apes, they walked on two legs, and males probably fought each other for mating opportunities. We know this because males fight for mates in all of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas. And because males are larger than females when they fight for mates. And the fossil record indicates that our male ancestors were larger than females. So males tend to be larger, more muscular, stronger, more physically aggressive, when they fight for mates. Our species has all the hallmarks of a species that's experienced an evolutionary history of male fighting for mates. For example, men have, on average, 60 percent more muscle mass, and 75 percent more upper body muscle mass, and those differences in musculature translate into large sex differences in strength. The average man is stronger than 99.9% of women. These are data on hand strength, which is a good predictor of overall upper body strength, on over 600 men and women. And as you can see, there's a large sex difference. And in fact, not one of almost 400 women had as strong of a hand strength as the average man. So, men can open jars. (Laughter) And move furniture or at least two things that we're good for. Who cares, right? The answer is that men care. Men, especially young men, seem really concerned about figuring out who's the toughest or strongest, or the most physically formidable, and sometimes they devise elaborate ways for determining this. From early development, boys and men are more physically aggressive than girls and women all over the world, and this aggression sometimes results in violence. Men have a virtual monopoly on same-sex homicides. In other words, men are vastly more likely to kill each other than women are to kill each other. These are data from every society from every time period in history for which data were available when the authors compiled them, on proportion of same-sex homicides that are male killing male. And as you can see, the percentage is always close to 100%. On average, 95% of same-sex homicides are committed by males, and importantly, these don't include war killings, which would bring the percentages even closer to 100%. And from what evidence that we have, a dominance among men translates into mating and reproductive opportunities. So we're a species that's experienced an evolutionary history in which our male ancestors won mating opportunities through the use or threat of force. In that regard, our apple has not fallen far from the evolutionary tree. But in other ways, human mating and reproduction are profoundly different from what we see in our close relatives, and they've changed a lot since our early ancestors. For example, males in chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas, spend time and effort competing for mates, but don't spend much time with individual females and don't provide resources. They don't provide food for their offspring. So that's a big change. Although most human societies allow polygamous marriage, that is one man married to more than one woman, even within polygamous societies, most marriages are monogamous. And in the average hunter-gatherer society, almost 80% of married women are monogamous, so that's different. And, importantly, men provide resources for their mates and offspring. So how did we get there? Well, in species where males fight each other for mates, dominant males indicated by the larger, darker male symbols here, tend to have more mating opportunities, and hence more offspring. And subordinate males tend to have fewer mating opportunities and are more likely to fail to reproduce. So this sets up an interesting situation, because for subordinate males, it would be advantageous to attempt monogamy rather than winning lots of mating opportunities. One mate is better than none. The problem is that in general, subordinate males cannot defend females from dominant males, and besides, females tend to prefer mating with dominant males for the genetic benefits, producing stronger, healthier offspring. So what changed all of this was probably several transitions happening together around the same time. By about two and a half million years ago, we had started to incorporate more meat into our diet. We know this from various lines of evidence, including - this is cool - stone tool cut marks on animal bones dated to 2.5 million years ago. That's cool. I love this stuff! And then by about 2 million years ago, brain size really started to increase, and with that came a lengthening of the juvenile period, so now kids became both really costly and costly for a long period of time. And this made male provisioning both possible and necessary. Possible because it's much easier to bring back calories, protein, fats, in the form of meat than trying to do that by transporting plant foods, and necessary because kids became so energetically costly that individual females would have had trouble providing resources for themselves and their offspring. And when we look at modern hunter-gatherer societies, that's what we see. These are aggregate data across several hunter-gatherer societies on net daily calories. Are you bringing in more calories than you consume,  through foraging, or are you consuming more than you bring in? And the green bars are net daily caloric surplus, in other words, bringing in more than you consume. And the red bars are a deficit, so you're consuming more than you bring in. And you'll notice that men from about 20 years of age to 60 years of age are operating at a daily caloric surplus. They bring in, generally through hunting, more calories than they can consume, and these calories are distributed. If it's large game, it's generally distributed equally to everybody in the village or camp. Smaller items can be brought back to individual family, but this contrasts with what's going on with women, in their reproductive years, they're operating at a daily caloric deficit. Gestation, lactation, carrying babies, are extremely costly energetically and limit one's ability to forage efficiently. So male provisioning, both possible through hunting, and necessary. And this change had profound impacts on human mating and reproduction. In a sense, it tipped the balance for females. So now it was sometimes worth mating with a subordinate male, even if he may not possess the best genes, if he provided resources. And this is baboon pornography. (Laughter) I probably should have warned you there'd be monkey porn. This is from PlayBaboon Magazine.  Alright, I'm going to stop with the jokes. This is a female baboon in estrus, so her genitals are swollen, and this happens in a lot of primate species. Females' appearance changes over the cycle, and becomes more attractive and this incites male competition for females during the fertile part of the cycle, with dominant males tending to monopolize copulations, closer to ovulation. Well. We don't look like this. And you knew that. But what you might not know is that women's attractiveness does change over the cycle. My lab, and others, have shown that women's faces, voices, even odors, are more attractive to men during the fertile part of the cycle. But these changes are extremely subtle. And compared to other primates,  the evidence indicates that we've evolved to suppress cues to ovulation. That in a sense, ovulation is concealed in humans. But think about what impact this would have. This would mean that dominant males  would not be able to monopolize copulations near ovulation. It would protect the pair bond from invasion by a dominant male. So that a male in a pair would have more confidence that he was the father of the offspring. The couple is having sex throughout the cycle. And this is unique to human mating, we don't see it in many other primates. We have sex throughout the cycle. And so this would essentially increase a male's confidence in paternity, because a dominant or some other male wouldn't be able to target the female and bully their way in at the fertile point in the cycle. And this would have important implications for parental investment, in particular, males providing resources for their offspring. Because across species, when males provide resources for offspring, they target those resources toward their own biological offspring, and they avoid investing in the offspring of unrelated males. And so the evolution of male care for offspring and investing in resources and offspring, pair bonding, and concealed ovulation, went very much hand-in-hand over our evolution. We have also evolved a specialized psychology for forming long-term romantic relationships with the possibility of investing in offspring together. We fall in love. All around the world, people prefer mates who are kind and generous and capable and willing to care for mates and offspring. In one of the largest cross-cultural studies of human mate preferences ever conducted, covering 33 countries shown in red here, the single most important mate choice criterion to both men and women, was mutual love and attraction. But as you also know, people are not always perfectly faithful to their mates. And in particular, women sometimes face a tradeoff between good genes and investment. Women sometimes find themselves in relationships with men who may be caring providers, but may not possess the best quality genes for offspring making them strong and healthy. And several features of women's mating psychology seem to have evolved, in part, to resolve this trade off. And I mean, recruiting genes, if you will, from outside of the long-term relationship. For example, women have more sexual fantasies about men other than their long-term partner, during the fertile part of the cycle, and that's particularly true if the long-term partner has physical signs of being lower in genetic quality, like he's less physically attractive. I think that's interesting. (Laughter) That's why I'm talking about it, I hope you do too. And women's mate preferences similarly change over the cycle so that they prefer more dominant, more masculine males during the fertile part of the cycle. These are results of a study that I conducted on women's preferences for men's voices. And I used computer software to manipulate recordings of men's voices to make them sound either more masculine or more dominant, or more subordinate, more feminine. And I had women rate them on how attractive would this man be  for a short-term, purely sexual relationship, and for a long-term committed relationship? And I also got information about where women were in their cycles. Were they in the fertile or non-fertile part of the cycle? These were all women not taking hormonal contraception. And what I found was that women preferred a more masculine, dominant-sounding voice, specifically in the fertile point of the cycle, and only for a sexual relationship versus a long-term committed relationship. Now, this sounds like science fiction, but it's science, fact. Because this result has been shown lots of times across a variety of domains from women's preferences for men's voices, that this result was replicated by another lab. Women's preferences for men's faces, bodies, odors, and even behavior. Well, I said that we would get to orgasm. (Laughter) And we're there. I just want to start by saying I'm for it. (Laughter) I'm pro-orgasm. I think more people should have more orgasms. But from a scientific perspective, women's orgasm is especially fascinating because there's evidence indicating that it increases the probability that conception will result from an act of sex. There's evidence that it brings sperm up through the female reproductive tract and toward the egg. And think about what the implications here could be. If women were more likely to have orgasms with some men than others, then this could be a mechanism by which they choose, not consciously, to be fertilized by some males and not others. And wouldn't you predict that women would be more likely to have orgasms with males of high genetic quality? And in fact, a study by my lab published just a couple of years ago found that women reported more orgasms, earlier timed orgasms, that is, they were easier to achieve, they achieved them more quickly, when they were having sex when their mate was more masculine and more dominant, and what's interesting is that this was true only for their orgasms from sexual intercourse, but not from other partnered sexual behaviors. I'll let you use your imagination what those might be. So we've seen that thinking like an evolutionist can enable us to predict things about ourselves that we did not already know, and would not likely have guessed for a long time. We didn't know that women's mate preferences changed over the cycle. Until evolutionary thinking led us to that discovery. So that's one point that I want to make. But we've also seen how evolutionary thinking can clarify and unite diverse parts of the human experience, and help us understand the best and the worst of ourselves, from violence and aggression and infidelity to men's care for their children, sexual attraction, sexual pleasure, and even the strength and fragility of romantic love.

Where does an artwork begin? Now sometimes that question is absurd. It can seem deceptively simple, as it was when I asked the question with this piece, ""Portable Planetarium,"" that I made in 2010. I asked the question: ""What would it look like to build a planetarium of one\'s own?"" I know you all ask that every morning, but I asked myself that question. And as an artist, I was thinking about our effort, our desire, our continual longing that we\'ve had over the years to make meaning of the world around us through materials. And for me, to try and find the kind of wonder, but also a kind of futility that lies in that very fragile pursuit, is part of my art work.', '00:58': ""So I bring together the materials I find around me, I gather them to try and create experiences, immersive experiences that occupy rooms, that occupy walls, landscapes, buildings. But ultimately, I want them to occupy memory. And after I've made a work, I find that there's usually one memory of that work that burns in my head. And this is the memory for me -- it was this sudden kind of surprising experience of being immersed inside that work of art. And it stayed with me and kind of reoccurred in my work about 10 years later."", '01:34': 'But I want to go back to my graduate school studio. I think it\'s interesting, sometimes, when you start a body of work, you need to just completely wipe the plate clean, take everything away. And this may not look like wiping the plate clean, but for me, it was. Because I had studied painting for about 10 years, and when I went to graduate school, I realized that I had developed skill, but I didn\'t have a subject. It was like an athletic skill, because I could paint the figure quickly, but I didn\'t know why. I could paint it well, but it didn\'t have content. And so I decided to put all the paints aside for a while, and to ask this question, which was: ""Why and how do objects acquire value for us?"" How does a shirt that I know thousands of people wear, a shirt like this one, how does it somehow feel like it\'s mine?', '02:25': 'So I started with that experiment, I decided, by collecting materials that had a certain quality to them. They were mass-produced, easily accessible, completely designed for the purpose of their use, not for their aesthetic. So things like toothpicks, thumbtacks, pieces of toilet paper, to see if in the way that I put my energy, my hand, my time into them, that the behavior could actually create a kind of value in the work itself. One of the other ideas is, I wanted the work to become live. So I wanted to take it off of the pedestal, not have a frame around it, have the experience not be that you came to something and told you that it was important, but that you discover that it was in your own time.', '03:08': 'So this is like a very, very old idea in sculpture, which is: How do we breathe life into inanimate materials? And so, I would go to a space like this, where there was a wall, and use the paint itself, pull the paint out off the wall, the wall paint into space to create a sculpture. Because I was also interested in this idea that these terms, ""sculpture,"" ""painting,"" ""installation"" -- none of these mattered in the way we actually see the world. So I wanted to blur those boundaries, both between mediums that artists talk about, but also blur the experience of being in life and being in art, so that when you are in your everyday, or when you are in one of my works, and you saw, you recognized the everyday, you could then move that experience into your own life, and perhaps see the art in everyday life.', '04:00': ""I was in graduate school in the '90s, and my studio just became more and more filled with images, as did my life. And this confusion of images and objects was really part of the way I was trying to make sense of materials. And also, I was interested in how this might change the way that we actually experience time. If we're experiencing time through materials, what happens when images and objects become confused in space? So I started by doing some of these experiments with images. And if you look back to the 1880s, that's when the first photographs started turning into film. And they were done through studies of animals, the movement of animals. So horses in the United States, birds in France. They were these studies of movement that then slowly, like zoetropes, became film."", '04:53': ""So I decided, I will take an animal and I'm going to play with that idea of how the image is not static for us anymore, it's moving. It's moving in space. And so I chose as my character the cheetah, because she is the fastest land-dwelling creature on earth. And she holds that record, and I want to use her record to actually make it kind of a measuring stick for time. And so this is what she looked like in the sculpture as she moved through space. This kind of broken framing of the image in space, because I had put up notepad paper and had it actually project on it. Then I did this experiment where you have kind of a race, with these new tools and video that I could play with. So the falcon moves out in front, the cheetah, she comes in second, and the rhino is trying to catch up behind."", '05:44': ""Then another one of the experiments, I was thinking about how, if we try and remember one thing that happened to us when we were, let's say, 10 years old. It's very hard to remember even what happened in that year. And for me, I can think of maybe one, maybe two, and that one moment has expanded in my mind to fill that entire year. So we don't experience time in minutes and seconds. So this is a still of the video that I took, printed out on a piece of paper, the paper is torn and then the video is projected on top of it. And I wanted to play with this idea of how, in this kind of complete immersion of images that's enveloped us, how one image can actually grow and can haunt us."", '06:33': ""So I had all of these -- these are three out of, like, 100 experiments I was trying with images for over about a decade, and never showing them, and I thought, OK, how do I bring this out of the studio, into a public space, but retain this kind of energy of experimentation that you see when you go into a laboratory, you see when you go into a studio, and I had this show coming up and I just said, alright, I'm going to put my desk right in the middle of the room. So I brought my desk and I put it in the room, and it actually worked in this kind of very surprising way to me, in that it was this kind of flickering, because of the video screens, from afar. And it had all of the projectors on it, so the projectors were creating the space around it, but you were drawn towards the flickering like a flame. And then you were enveloped in the piece at the scale that we're all very familiar with, which is the scale of being in front of a desk or a sink or a table, and you are immersed, then, back into this scale, this one-to-one scale of the body in relation to the image. But on this surface, you had these projections on paper being blown in the wind, so there was this confusion of what was an image and what was an object."", '07:46': ""So this is what the work looked like when it went into a larger room, and it wasn't until I made this piece that I realized that I'd effectively made the interior of a planetarium, without even realizing that. And I remembered, as a child, loving going to the planetarium. And back then, the planetarium, there was always not only these amazing images on the ceiling, but you could see the projector itself whizzing and burring, and this amazing camera in the middle of the room. And it was that, along with seeing the audience around you looking up, because there was an audience in the round at that time, and seeing them, and experiencing, being part of an audience. So this is an image from the web that I downloaded of people who took images of themselves in the work. And I like this image because you see how the figures get mixed with the work. So you have the shadow of a visitor against the projection, and you also see the projections across a person's shirt. So there were these self-portraits made in the work itself, and then posted, and it felt like a kind of cyclical image-making process. And a kind of an end to that."", '08:54': 'But it reminded me and brought me back to the planetarium, and that interior, and I started to go back to painting. And thinking about how a painting is actually, for me, about the interior images that we all have. There\'s so many interior images, and we\'ve become so focused on what\'s outside our eyes. And how do we store memory in our mind, how certain images emerge out of nowhere or can fall apart over time. And I started to call this series the ""Afterimage"" series, which was a reference to this idea that if we all close our eyes right now, you can see there\'s this flickering light that lingers, and when we open it again, it lingers again -- this is happening all the time. And an afterimage is something that a photograph can never replace, you never feel that in a photograph. So it really reminds you of the limits of the camera\'s lens. So it was this idea of taking the images that were outside of me -- this is my studio -- and then trying to figure out how they were being represented inside me.', '09:56': 'So really quickly, I\'m just going to whiz through how a process might develop for the next piece. So it might start with a sketch, or an image that\'s burned in my memory from the 18th century -- it\'s Piranesi\'s ""Colosseum."" Or a model the size of a basketball -- I built this around a basketball, the scale\'s evidenced by the red cup behind it. And that model can be put into a larger piece as a seed, and that seed can grow into a bigger piece. And that piece can fill a very, very large space. But it can funnel down into a video that\'s just made from my iPhone, of a puddle outside my studio in a rainy night. So this is an afterimage of the painting made in my memory, and even that painting can fade as memory does.', '10:46': ""So this is the scale of a very small image from my sketchbook. You can see how it can explode to a subway station that spans three blocks. And you could see how going into the subway station is like a journey through the pages of a sketchbook, and you can see sort of a diary of work writ across a public space, and you're turning the pages of 20 years of art work as you move through the subway. But even that sketch actually has a different origin, it has an origin in a sculpture that climbs a six-story building, and is scaled to a cat from the year 2002. I remember that because I had two black cats at the time. And this is an image of a work from Japan that you can see the afterimage of in the subway. Or a work in Venice, where you see the image etched in the wall. Or how a sculpture that I did at SFMOMA in 2001, and created this kind of dynamic line, how I stole that to create a dynamic line as you descend down into the subway itself."", '11:52': ""And this merging of mediums is really interesting to me. So how can you take a line that pulls tension like a sculpture and put it into a print? Or then use line like a drawing in a sculpture to create a dramatic perspective? Or how can a painting mimic the process of printmaking? How can an installation use the camera's lens to frame a landscape? How can a painting on string become a moment in Denmark, in the middle of a trek? And how, on the High Line, can you create a piece that camouflages itself into the nature itself and becomes a habitat for the nature around it?"", '12:33': 'And I\'ll just end with two pieces that I\'m making now. This is a piece called ""Fallen Sky"" that\'s going to be a permanent commission in Hudson Valley, and it\'s kind of the planetarium finally come down and grounding itself in the earth. And this is a work from 2013 that\'s going to be reinstalled, have a new life in the reopening of MOMA. And it\'s a piece that the tool itself is the sculpture. So the pendulum, as it swings, is used as a tool to create the piece. So each of the piles of objects go right up to one centimeter to the tip of that pendulum. So you have this combination of the lull of that beautiful swing, but also the tension that it constantly could destroy the piece itself.', '13:20': ""And so, it doesn't really matter where any of these pieces end up, because the real point for me is that they end up in your memory over time, and they generate ideas beyond themselves."", '13:34': 'Thank you.', '13:35': '(Applause)'}"

I have. But what started off as momentary curiosity very quickly turned into an almost five-year horrific battle that almost ruined my life. I Google Images reverse-searched myself: a function of Google that allows you to upload an image and it shows you where it is on the internet. This is me at 17 years old. An innocent selfie I took before a party.', '00:53': ""Now, before I continue, I must point out that what I'm about to talk about is very confronting and graphic. But there's no way out. This is a very confronting issue."", '01:07': 'In a split second, my screen was flooded with that image and dozens more images of me that had been stolen from my social media, on links connected to porn sites. On these sites, nameless, faceless sexual predators had published highly explicit sexual commentary about me and what they\'d like to do to me. ""Cover her face and we\'d fuck her body,"" one person wrote. They also published identifying information about me: where I lived, what I studied, who I was.', '01:54': 'But things got worse. I soon discovered that these sexual predators had doctored or photoshopped my face onto the bodies of naked adult actresses engaged in sexual intercourse, on solo shots of me being ejaculated on by two men. Sperm was edited onto my face. I was edited onto the cover of a porn DVD. Perpetrators had edited my images to give the effect that my blouse was transparent or see-through, so you could see my nipples. Perpetrators ejaculated on images of me, took photos of their sperm and penises on these images and posted them onto porn sites. ""Cum on printed pigs,"" is what they call it.', '02:59': 'Now, you might be wondering, what sorts of images I posted on social media. This is me, at around 19 at the Claremont Hotel, just a few suburbs away. And they superimposed that face into this. And things got worse. Nothing was off limits for these predators. They even posted an image with my little sister on these sites too.', '03:29': 'Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, you do dress provocatively, even a little sexually suggestive, attention seeking maybe."" But just because a woman\'s body gets attention, doesn\'t mean she\'s attention-seeking. And what is provocative anyway, what is sexually suggestive? In some parts of the world, showing your ankles is promiscuous, is provocative. It\'s just like, no matter what a woman wears, it\'s always perceived as more sexual than it is. For me, I just wanted to feel pretty and confident. What\'s so wrong with that?', '04:16': 'Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, can\'t you just set your social media on private?"" Well, these perpetrators were calculated. They befriended my friends on social media under fake profiles, they followed the public galleries of the events and places I regularly visited.', '04:41': ""But why? Why should one have to retreat and hide out of fear that something like this could happen? What I post and what I wear isn't an invitation to violate and abuse me. The only person that should be changing their behavior is the perpetrators."", '05:04': '(Applause)', '05:16': ""Now, you might be thinking, why me? Well, I'm just one of the thousands upon thousands of ordinary women who are being preyed upon in these mass-scale, horrific online cultures, websites and threads that are dedicated to sexually exploiting and doctoring ordinary images of women into porn. As I speak, there are women who are being preyed upon, and they don't even know it."", '05:55': 'In the beginning, I tried seeking help. I went to police, I contacted government agencies, I even tried to hire a private investigator, but they were too expensive. There was nothing that they could do. I mean, what could you do when the sites are hosted overseas and the perpetrators are from overseas? I was told I had to contact the sites one by one, notifying the webmasters to get everything deleted. And so as you can imagine, in complete and utter fear and pain, I did.', '06:41': ""I contacted the webmasters, requesting that they delete the material shared without consent. And I had some successes, but I also had some major setbacks. The more I fought, the more sites I would discover, and with time, the more my images were being seen and shared in the tens of thousands. I had one webmaster respond to me saying he'll only delete the site if I sent him nude photos of myself within 24 hours."", '07:21': ""And this went on for years, fighting against these dodgy, disgusting sites. But I was fighting a losing battle. And I couldn't continue this any longer for my own mental health. But what could I do?"", '07:40': 'Maybe, I thought, if I spoke out, I could reclaim my name, and I could rewrite my narrative on my own terms. Maybe if I spoke out, I could raise awareness about this. Maybe I could even try to change the law. And so I did.', '08:04': '(Applause)', '08:14': 'I spoke out publicly late last year and news of my story reverberated around the world. But this was the response. ""She\'s a fat, ugly slut, she\'s a whore."" ""She\'s an attention-seeking piece of trash."" ""Feel flattered, baby, it\'s a compliment."" I was victim-blamed and slut-shamed and told I was deserving of what happened to me. And quite frankly, that was more difficult for me to endure than my actual experiences of image-based abuse.', '08:51': ""But I couldn’t let this criticism defeat me. I knew what the perpetrators had done was wrong, and I knew what they were doing to others was wrong. And so I petitioned. I sent out impassioned pleas for support. But it didn't work. I think I got like 330 signatures. And that was really disheartening."", '09:17': ""But I then contacted my state and federal MPs. And I was referred to the New South Wales Attorney General's department, who were already in the process of drafting new laws to criminalize the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images. Image-based sexual abuse. Some of you might know it as revenge porn. And soon I became a spokesperson, a public face for the new laws. But I must point out, I do not in any way, shape or form want to take credit for this change in the law. This is on the backs of cybersafety experts, of researchers, of the Attorney General's department, of so many people who have fought for years. New South Wales was the first state in all the world to specifically include a provision on altering images. Something that happened to me, something you certainly don't hear about very often. And now ACT has also criminalized this, also with a provision on altered images. And next year, WA is introducing legislation and hopefully, they introduce a provision on altered images and I urge every state and every country in this world to follow suit, because right now, there's no justice for people like me."", '10:46': ""Despite it all, despite the hate and despite the criticism, despite the fact that I'm never going to get justice, because my experiences happened before this movement of law reform, speaking out was the best thing I've ever done, because I know for a fact that it has helped people. And I just want to live in a world where, regardless of what I wear or what I post, that I'm still worthy of being treated with dignity and respect. Respect. Now, that's an idea worth sharing."", '11:28': '(Applause)', '11:29': 'Thank you.', '11:31': '(Applause)'}"

How many in here have heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before? Let's see a show of hands. OK, that's practically everybody. Probably due to the fact that we are Sweden's neighbor."", '00:54': ""I frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to this first question which is one-half to two-thirds. This is actually the first time ever that does not match. It was practically everybody."", '01:08': ""So, for those who haven't heard of us: well, the Pirate Party, we love the net. We love copying and sharing, and we love civil liberties. For that, some people call us pirates. Probably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame. That didn't work very well. We decided to stand tall about it instead."", '01:31': ""And so in 2006, I founded a new political party. I led it for its first five years. And the European elections, the last European elections, we became the largest party and the most coveted youth demographic, sub-30. And what's interesting is we did that on less than one percent of the competition's budget. We had a campaign budget total of 50,000 euros. They had six million between them -- and we beat them. That gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude. And I'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that."", '02:19': ""We developed swarm methodologies. And they can be applied to any business or social cause. Well, almost any -- there's a small asterisk by the end, and I'll get to that in just a minute. But applying these -- and we've done this dozens of times, we know that this works."", '02:41': ""We've put two people in the European Parliament, we have 45 people in various German state parliaments, we're in the Icelandic parliament, the Czech senate, many, many, many more, local councils -- and, as said, we've spread to 70 countries. And that's not bad for a political movement that hasn't even been around for a decade."", '03:01': ""So today we're going to talk a bit about -- how people are motivated to be part of change, to be part of something bigger than themselves. And how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power of wanting to make the world a better place. And in the end, come out a little on the better."", '03:32': ""When I speak to businesspeople, I frequently make them very upset when I contradict them and say that no, your employees are not your most valuable asset. Your most valuable asset is the thousands of people who want to work for you for free. And you don't let them. They get very upset about that."", '03:59': 'A swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen of their own will to converge on a common goal. There\'s this ""Futurama"" quote: ""When push comes to shove, you gotta do what you love -- even if it\'s not a good idea.""', '04:22': '(Laughter)', '04:23': 'I mean, seriously, what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world by starting a political party?', '04:31': '(Laughter)', '04:32': 'This kind of idiot, apparently. But it works! What you need to do is to put a stake in the ground. You need to announce your goal. Just say, ""I want to accomplish this."" I\'m going to do this. And it doesn\'t need to be very costly.', '04:52': 'My announcement was just two lines in a chat channel. ""Hey, look, the Pirate Party has its website up now after New Year\'s."" And the address. That was all the advertising I ever did. The next time I had several hundred activists wanting to work with us.', '05:10': ""When you provide such a focus point, a swarm intelligence emerges. When people can rally to a flag. And that's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency. It's a huge advantage -- you're running circles around all the legacy organizations. And there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal in order for this to work."", '05:38': 'These four criteria are that your goal must be: tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.', '05:49': 'Let\'s take a look at them: It needs to be tangible. A lot of people say, ""Well, you know, we should make the world a better place,"" or, ""Yeah, we should all feel good now."" Not going to work. You need a binary. Are we there yet, or are we not there yet?', '06:08': ""It needs to be credible. Somebody seeing the project plan that you're posting needs to see that, yes, this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be. You need to break it down into subgoals that each by themselves are seen as doable, and when you add the subgoals together, we've gone to where we want."", '06:27': 'It needs to be -- and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working swarmwise -- it needs to be inclusive. Anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say, ""I want to do this -- and there\'s my spot!"" And they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody\'s permission. And that is exactly what\'ll happen.', '06:55': ""And, last but not least, it needs to be epic. It needs to energize people. It needs to electrify people. Shoot for the moon! On second thought, don't shoot for the moon, we've already been there -- shoot for Mars!"", '07:12': '(Laughter)', '07:16': ""In contrast, you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming around making the most correct tax audit ever. Doesn't electrify people. Go to Mars."", '07:34': ""A lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles. We're going to climb a huge mountain. So how do you motivate people to do that? Well, it turns out that obstacles are not the problem. Not knowing the obstacles is the problem. If you know how high the mountain is, you know exactly what it takes to scale it. We know exactly how far away Mars is and what it takes to get there. If you can plan it like a project, you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it, exactly like a project."", '08:05': ""Let's see: we're going to Mars, we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists, one dozen volunteer metallurgists, some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard and so on."", '08:19': 'When you can list the resources, you know what you need to get there. When you know what you need to get there, you can go there. And the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence, which is where the cost efficiency comes in.', '08:38': ""There's a TED Talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money, and it presents science on how we're really motivated by three things, in terms of larger creative tasks, when we work for something bigger than ourselves."", '08:56': ""We work for autonomy, mastery and purpose. We've covered purpose already. As in, working for something bigger, tangible, credible, inclusive and epic. So, where that motivation talk ends, what it doesn't answer is, how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power. And this is where working swarmwise comes in, this is where swarm intelligence comes in. Turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for -- and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school. But it works. We know it works. We have people in many, many parliaments to prove it."", '09:47': ""Those three factors are: speed, trust and scalability. We optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop, cutting them out of the decision loop. That means cutting yourself out of the decision loop, which can be hard. But you've got to communicate your vision so passionately, so strongly, that everybody knows what the goal is and can find something, some step that takes the movement just a little closer to that goal. And when tens of thousands of people do that on a weekly basis, you become an unstoppable force."", '10:29': 'We had a three-person rule in our organization, saying that if three self-identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement, they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the organization, including spending resources. When you talk about this kind of empowerment to traditional businesspeople, they think you belong in a zoo. But you know what? I led this organization for five years, there were 50,000 registered members and many, many more anonymous activists. It was not abused once. Everybody had the key to the treasure chest. It was not abused one single time.', '11:14': 'Turns out when you give people the keys to the castle, and look them in the eye and say, ""I trust you,"" they step up to the plate. And that\'s a beautiful thing to see happen.', '11:28': ""Obviously, not everything went according to plan, but that's a different thing. We made mistakes. We should expect mistakes. If you're pioneering something, that means you must, by definition, venture into the unknown. When you're trying the unknown, some things won't go as planned. That's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown. To find the great, you must allow mistakes to happen. So you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a risk-positive environment. Therefore we optimize for iteration speed. Meaning that we try, we fail, we try again, we fail faster, we fail better, we try again, we fail better again. Maybe after we've tried 15 times, we've mastered some specific subject, so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those 15 times."", '12:20': ""We optimize on trust. We encourage diversity. You need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context because language is an incredibly strong inclusionary and exclusionary social marker. This one-brand-fits-all message -- forget it! That's what they teach you at business school -- it doesn't work. Or at least, it doesn't give you the cost-efficiency advantage of working swarmwise."", '12:57': ""This leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel in different social groups who try out different methods of working toward the goal. Some of them will work but in order to find the great ones, you need this diversity. And you need to communicate that we need that diversity. If somebody on this side does not understand what those guys are doing, that's OK because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement. And it's OK that I don't understand their social context. I'm not expected to -- I understand my social context. I contribute with something I know. Make people aware of this diversity."", '13:35': ""Finally, scalability. Get feet on the ground. Again, in business school, they teach you to use a lean organization. Forget that. Just scale up the organization from the get-go. Start with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city. When you have lots and lots of small responsibilities in such a scaffolding that supports the swarm, supports the activists, you'll find that these boxes in the org charts are getting filled in quite rapidly, and they start to get filled in beyond your horizon with people you've never heard of. And so, this swarm keeps growing to tens of thousands of people, each taking on something small with very, very decentralized mandate to act on the organization. And this is when a swarm intelligence emerges. This is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what's to be done. Everybody is taking their own small steps towards it. So the swarm starts to act as a coherent organism. And it's amazing to watch. This is when you're awarded by the cost-efficiency advantage over your competitors by two orders of magnitude. Two orders of magnitude. This is not just a silver bullet."", '15:05': ""So we've been talking a lot about the big picture today. You can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff. Do you want to change the world? Do you want to bring clean water to a billion people? Teach three billion people to read? Maybe you're into social change; you want to introduce unconditional basic income. Or maybe you want to take humanity to Mars. You can do this using these methods."", '15:27': ""You can do this. It's about leadership. It's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world. Because no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world, no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world, you are probably right."", '15:52': ""So one question I want everybody here to ask themselves today is the observation that change doesn't just happen, somebody makes it happen -- do you want to be that person? Do you want to be that person?"", '16:10': ""And then one last thing: There's one component more that's required to work swarmwise that I haven't mentioned yet. And that is fun. This goes beyond just enjoying your job, this goes beyond having a pinball machine in the office. Because this is actually required to succeed in a swarmwise scenario. This is required to succeed to get that cost-efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude. For the reason that you need to attract volunteers. And people, in this aspect, are rather predictable. People will go to other people who are having fun. In contrast, they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun. So, having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office. It's an absolute and unavoidable requirement for organizational and operational success when you're working swarmwise."", '17:27': 'So, in summary -- a recipe for a swarm organization using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage. Your goal: it needs to be tangible, credible, inclusive and epic. Your organization needs to be optimized for speed, trust and scalability. You need to enjoy yourselves. And that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost-efficiency advantage.', '18:05': 'Thank you.', '18:07': '(Applause)'}"

This is approximately 30% of the entire world population, which means that the remaining 70% of the world -- close to five billion people -- do not have access to a computer or the internet. Let's think about that number for a second. Five billion people; that's four times the population of India, that have never touched a computer, have never accessed the internet. So this is a digital abyss that we're talking about, this is not a digital divide."", '01:24': ""Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison that shows the internet connections around the world. What we can see is that most of the internet connections are centered on North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is engulfed in the dark shadow of digital divide. Next, we can see connections, city-to-city, around the world, and we can see that most of the information generated is being generated between North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is not broadcasting their ideas or information. So what does this mean? We are living in a world that seems to be having a digital revolution, a revolution that everyone here thinks that we're part of, but the 70% of the world that is digitally excluded is not part of this."", '02:06': ""What does this mean? Well, the people that will be digitally excluded won't be able to compete in the labor markets of the future, they won't be connected, they'll be less informed, they'll be less inspired and they'll be less responsible. Internet should not be a luxury, it should be a right, because it is a basic social necessity of the 21st century. We can't operate without it."", '02:27': '(Applause)', '02:29': 'Thank you.', '02:30': 'It allows us to connect to the world. It empowers us. It gives us social participation. It is a tool for change. And so, how are we going to bridge this digital divide? Well, there are many models that try and bridge the digital divide, that try and include the population at large. But the question is: Are they really working?', '02:54': ""I'm sure everybody here knows One Laptop per Child, where one computer is given to one child. The problem with this is, do we really want children to take computers to their homes, homes that have adverse conditions? And we also must understand that by giving a child a computer, we're also transferring costs, very high costs, such as internet connection, electricity, maintenance, software, updates. So we must create different models, models that help the families rather than add a burden on them. Also, let's not forget about the carbon footprint. Imagine five billion laptops. What would the world look like then? Imagine the hazardous residue that would be generated from that. Imagine the trash. So if we give one computer to one person, and we multiply that times five billion, even if that laptop is a hundred dollars, then we would have 483 trillion dollars. Now let's consider we're only counting the youth, ages 10 to 24. That's approximately 30% of the digitally excluded population. Then that would be 145 trillion dollars. What nation has this amount of money? This is not a sustainable model."", '04:06': 'So with this in mind, we created a different model. We created the RIA, in Spanish, or in English, Learning and Innovation Network, which is a network of community centers that bring education through the use of technology. We wanted to increase the number of users per computer in such a way that we could dilute the cost of infrastructure, the cost per user, and that we could bring education and technology to everybody within these communities.', '04:30': ""Let's look at a basic comparison. The RIA has 1,650 computers. If we had used the One Laptop per Child model of a 1 to 1 ratio, then we would have benefited 1,650 users. What we did instead is set up centers that have longer hours of operation than schools, that also include all of the population -- our youngest user is 3 years old, the oldest is 86 -- and with this, in less than two years, we were able to reach 140,000 users, out of which --"", '05:05': '(Applause)', '05:07': 'Thank you.', '05:08': 'out of which, 34,000 have already graduated from our courses.', '05:12': 'Another thing with One Laptop per Child is that it doesn\'t guarantee the educational use of a computer. Technology is nothing without that content. We need to use it as a means, not as an end. How did we accomplish such a high impact? Well, you can\'t just go into a community and pretend to change it, you need to look at a lot of factors. So what we do is a thing we call ""urban acupuncture."" We first start by looking at the basic geography of a site. So take, for example, Ecatepec. This is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Mexico. It has a very low income level. So we look at the basic geography, we look at roads, streets, the flux of pedestrians and vehicles. Then we look at income, we look at education. Then we set up a center there in the place that\'s going to heal the body, a little needle to change the city body. And there we go.', '06:09': ""And so, there are four basic elements that we need to consider when we're using education through technology. The first one is we need to create spaces. We need to create a space that is welcoming to the community, a space that is according to the needs of the children and of the elders and of every possible person that lives within that community. So we create these spaces that are all made with recycled materials. We use modular architecture to lower the ecological impact."", '06:42': ""And second, connection. By connection, I mean not only a connection to the internet, that's too easy. We need to create a connection that's an interconnection of humans. The internet is a very complex organism that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts and the emotions of human beings. We need to create networks that aid in exchanging information."", '07:07': ""Third, content. Education is nothing without content. And you can't pretend to have a relationship of only a computer with a child. So we create a route, a very basic learning route, where we teach people how to use a computer, how to use the internet, how to use office software, and in 72 hours, we create digital citizens. You can't pretend that people are just going to touch a computer and become digitally included, you need to have a process. And after this, then they can take on a longer educational route."", '07:39': ""And then fourth, training. We need to train not only the users, but we need to train the people that will facilitate learning for these people. When you're talking about the digital divide, people have stigmas, people have fears; people don't understand how it can complement their lives. So what we do is train facilitators so that they can help in breaking that digital barrier."", '08:03': ""So, we have four elements: we have a space that's created, we have a connection, we have content and we have training. We have created a digital learning community. But there is one more element, which is the benefits that technology can create, because it is not printed, static content. It is dynamic; it is modifiable. So we have we do is, we provide content, then we do training, then we analyze the user patterns so that we can improve content. So it creates a virtuous circle. It allows us to deliver education according to different types of intelligence and according to different user needs. With this in mind, we have to think that technology is something that can modify according to human processes."", '08:51': 'I want to share a story. In 2006, I went to live here. This is one of the poorest communities in all of Mexico. I went to film a documentary on the people that live off trash, entirely of trash -- their houses are built with trash, they eat trash, they dress in trash. And after two months of living with them, of seeing the children and the way they work, I understood that the only thing that can change and that can break the poverty cycle is education. And we can use technology to bring education to these communities. Here is another shot.', '09:23': ""The main message is that technology is not going to save the world; we are, and we can use technology to help us. I'm sure everybody here has experienced it; what moves technology is human energy. So let's use this energy to make the world a better place."", '09:42': 'Thank you.', '09:43': '(Applause)'}"

Thank you all very much for coming along today. I'd like to begin my talk with a story. It's a story that begins, but does not end, with a mathematician named Tim Gowers. Gowers is one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. He's a professor at Cambridge University and a recipient of the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize of mathematics. Gowers is also a blogger, and in January of 2009, he used his blog to pose a very striking question: Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?"", '00:51': 'So what he was proposing in this post was to use his blog to attack a difficult unsolved mathematical problem -- a problem which he said he would ""love to solve"" -- completely in the open, using his blog to post his ideas and his partial progress. What\'s more, he issued an open invitation, inviting anybody in the world who thought that they had an idea to contribute to post their idea in the comment section of the blog. His hope was that by combining the ideas of many minds, he could make easy work of his hard mathematical problem. He called this experiment the Polymath Project.', '01:34': 'Well, the Polymath Project got off to a slow start. In the first seven hours, nobody posted any comments. But then, a mathematician from the University of British Columbia named Jozsef Solymosi posted a short comment. And this seemed to break the ice, because a few minutes later, a high school teacher named Jason Dyer posted a suggestion. And a few minutes after that, another mathematician named Terence Tao, also a Fields medalist, posted an idea. And things really started to move quickly at this point. Over the next 37 days, 27 different people would post 800 substantive comments containing 170,000 words. I was not a serious participant, but I was following along closely from the start, and it was just amazing. The speed with which an idea would be tentatively proposed and then really rapidly developed by other people and improved, sometimes discarded -- it was just amazing. Gowers described the process as being to ordinary research ""as driving is to pushing a car.""', '02:38': '(Laughter)', '02:40': ""At the end of the 37 days, Gowers used his blog to announce that they had solved the core problem; in fact, they had solved a harder generalization of the problem. The Polymath Project had succeeded. So what the Polymath Project suggests, at least to me, is that we can use the internet to build tools that actually expand our ability to solve the most challenging intellectual problems. Or, to put it in another way: we can build tools which actively amplify our collective intelligence in much the same way as, for millennia, we've used physical tools to amplify our strength. OK? So what I'd like to talk about today, or what I'd like to explore today, is what this means for science. It's much more important than just solving a single mathematical problem. It means an expansion in the range of scientific problems we can hope to attack at all. It means, potentially, an acceleration in the rate of scientific discovery. It means a change in the way we construct knowledge itself."", '03:48': 'So, before I get too overexcited, however, I would like to talk about some of the challenges, some of the problems. Particularly, I\'d like to describe a failure of this approach. It occurred in 2005, or started in 2005. A grad student at Caltech named John Stockton had a very good idea for what he called the ""Quantum Wiki,"" or ""Qwiki"" for short.', '04:14': '(Laughter)', '04:15': ""OK? It's a great idea. What he did with the Qwiki was -- the idea of the Qwiki was that it was going to be a great repository of human knowledge, much like Wikipedia. But instead of being focused on general knowledge, it was going to be focused on specialist knowledge in quantum computing. It was going be kind of a supertextbook for the field, with information about all the latest research, about what the big open problems in the field were, people's speculation about how to solve the problems, and so on. Like Wikipedia, the intention was that it would be written by the users, in this case, by experts in quantum computing. I was present at the conference at Caltech in 2005, when it was announced. And some of the people who I spoke to were very skeptical, but some of the people were very excited by the idea. They were impressed by the implementation; they were impressed by the amount of initial seed material which had been put on the site; and most of all, they were excited by the vision. But just because they were excited, didn't mean they wanted to take the time themselves to contribute. They hoped that other people would do so. And in the end, nobody, essentially, was really all that interested in contributing. If you look today, except in a few small corners, the Qwiki is essentially dead."", '05:35': ""And, sad to say, this is quite a common story. Many scientists, in fields ranging from genetics to string theory, have tried to start science wikis along very similar lines. And typically, they've failed for essentially the same reason. It's not just science wikis, either. Inspired by Facebook, many organizations have tried to create social networks for scientists, which will connect scientists to other people with similar interests. So they can share things like data or code, their ideas and so on. Again, it sounds like a good idea. But if you join one of these sites, you'll quickly discover that they're essentially empty. They're virtual ghost towns. So what's going on? What's the problem here? Why are these promising sites failing?"", '06:23': ""Well, imagine that you're an ambitious young scientist. In fact, I know some of you here are ambitious young scientists. Imagine you're an ambitious young scientist. You really would like to get a job -- a permanent job, a good job -- doing the work that you love. But it's incredibly competitive to get such jobs. Often, there'll be hundreds of very highly qualified applicants for positions. And so you find yourself working 60, 70, 80 hours a week, doing the one thing that you know will get you such a job, and that is writing scientific papers. You may think that the Qwiki is a wonderful idea in principle, but you also know that writing a single mediocre paper will do much more for your career and your job prospects than a long series of brilliant contributions to such a site. So even though you may like the idea and you may think it will advance science more quickly, you find you just can't conceive of it as being part of your job. It's not."", '07:24': ""The only things which can succeed in this kind of environment are projects like the Polymath Project, which, even though they employ an unconventional means to an end, they have an essential conservatism about them. The end product of the Polymath Project was still a scientific paper. In fact, it was several papers. Right? So unconventional means, but conventional ends. So there's a kind of conservatism about it. And don't get me wrong -- the Polymath Project is terrific, but it is a pity that scientists can only use tools which have this kind of conservative nature."", '08:02': ""So let me tell you a story about an instance where we moved away from this conservatism. It's a rare story where the conservatism has been broken. It occurred in the 1990s, when, as you know, for the first time, biologists were taking large amounts of genetic data to collect in the Human Genome Project. And there were sites online which would allow biologists to upload that data so it could be shared with other people around the world and analyzed by other people. Probably the best known of these is the site GenBank, which some of you may have heard of or used. And these sites, like GenBank, had the problem in common with Qwiki that scientists -- they're not paid or rewarded for sharing their data. It's all about publishing papers. So there was a considerable reluctance to actually upload the data. Yet, everybody could see that this was silly -- it was obvious that this was the right thing to do. But just because it was obvious didn't mean that people were actually doing it."", '09:06': ""So a meeting was convened in Bermuda in 1996 of many of the world's leading molecular biologists. And they sat and they discussed the problem for several days, and they came up with what are now called the Bermuda Principles, which state that: first, once human genetic data is taken in the lab, it should be immediately uploaded to a site like GenBank; and two, that the data would be in the public domain. And these principles were given teeth, because they were taken by the big scientific grant agencies -- the US National Institutes of Health, the UK Wellcome Trust -- and actually baked into policy. So it meant that if you were a scientist who wanted to work on the human genome, you had to agree to abide by these principles. And today, I'm very pleased to say, as a result, you can go online -- anybody here -- and download the human genome."", '09:58': 'So that\'s a terrific story. But the human genome is just a tiny, tiny fraction of all scientific knowledge. Even just in other parts of genetics, there is so much knowledge that is still locked up. I spoke with one bioinformatician who told me that he\'d been ""sitting on the genome of an entire species for more than a year."" An entire species. And in other parts of science, it is routine that scientists hoard their data. They hoard the computer code that they write that could be useful, potentially, to other people. They hoard their best ideas. And they often hoard even the descriptions of the problems that they think are most interesting. And so, what I and other people in the Open Science movement would like to do is, we\'d like to change this situation. We would like to change the culture of science so that scientists become much more strongly motivated to share all of these different kinds of knowledge. We want to change the values of individual scientists so they start to see it as part of their job to be sharing their data, to be sharing their code, to be sharing their best ideas and their problems. So, if we can do this, this kind of change in values, then we will indeed start to see individual scientists rewarded for doing these things; there will be incentives to do them.', '11:24': ""It's a difficult thing to do, however. We're talking about changing the culture of entire large parts of science. But it has happened before once in history, right back at the dawn of science. Galileo, 1609: he points his telescope up at the sky towards Saturn, and he sees for the first time in history what we now know are the rings of Saturn. Does he tell everybody in the world? No, he doesn't do that. He writes down a description, privately, and then he scrambles the letters in the description into an anagram, and he sends that anagram to several of his astronomer rivals."", '12:06': '(Laughter)', '12:07': ""And what this ensures is that, if they later make the same discovery, he can reveal the anagram and get the credit, but in the meantime, he hasn't given up any knowledge at all. And I'm sad to say that he was not uncommon at the time: Newton, Huygens, Hooke, Leonardo -- they all used similar devices. OK? The printing press had been around for 150 years by this time. And yet, there was a great battle in the 17th and 18th centuries to change the culture of science, so that it became expected that when a scientist made a discovery, they would reveal it in a journal."", '12:50': ""Now, that's great that that change has happened. It's terrific. But today, we have new technologies, we have new opportunities to share our knowledge in new ways and the ability to create tools that actually allow us to solve problems in entirely new ways. So we need to have a second open science revolution. It is my belief that any publicly funded science should be open science."", '13:18': ""How can we achieve this change? Well, if you're a scientist -- and I know many of you are not scientists, but if you are a scientist, then there are things that you can do. You can get involved in an open science project, even if it's just for a small fraction of your time. You can find forums online where you can share your knowledge in new ways, ways that allow other people to build on that knowledge. You can also, if you're more ambitious, start an open science project of your own. If you're really bold, you may wish to experiment with entirely new ways of collaborating, in much the same way as the Polymath Project did. But above all, what you should do is be very generous in giving credit to those of your colleagues who are practicing science in the open and to promote their work. It is only conservative scientific values that look down on these activities -- the sharing of data, the blogging, or using of wikis and so on. You can reject those conservative values and engage your scientific colleagues in conversation to promote the value of these new ways of working, to emphasize that it takes bravery to do these things, particularly by young scientists. It's through such conversation that the culture of science can be changed."", '14:42': ""So if you are not a scientist, there are also things that you can do. My belief is that the single most important thing that we can do to give impetus to open science is to create a general awareness amongst the population of the issue of open science and of its critical importance. If there is that general awareness, then the scientific community will inevitably find -- it will be dragged by the population at large in the right direction. There are simple things you can do. You can talk to your friends and acquaintances who are scientists and just ask them what are they doing to work more openly. Or you can use your imagination and your personal power to raise awareness in other ways. We're talking about changing not just what scientists do but what grant agencies do, what universities do and what governments do. And you can influence all of those things."", '15:40': 'Our society faces a fundamental question: What kinds of knowledge are we going to expect and incentivize our scientists to share? Will we continue as we have done in the past? Or will we embrace new kinds of sharing, which lead to new methods for solving problems and an acceleration in the process of science, entirely across the board? My hope is that we will embrace open science and really seize this opportunity that we have to reinvent discovery itself.', '16:17': 'Thank you. (Applause)'}"

As they whispered and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply under each other’s spell.', '01:54': 'Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason to face his first task. The hero was brought to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields unscathed.', '02:21': 'For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray.', '02:49': 'For the third task, Jason was finally face to face with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece off its branch.', '03:20': 'When the king saw the hero sprinting away— not only with the fleece, but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize and his conniving daughter home.', '03:37': 'But all the players in this tale had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father while the Argonauts escaped.', '03:58': 'As Colchis and their pursuers grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them. Buffeted by hostile winds, the wretched crew washed up on the island of Circe the sorceress. Medea begged her aunt to absolve them of wrongdoing— but bloody deeds are not so easily forgotten, and fallen heroes not so rapidly redeemed.'}"
https://www.ted.com/talks/jackie_tabick_the_balancing_act_of_compassion,The balancing act of compassion,"While we all agree that compassion is a great idea, Rabbi Tabick acknowledges there are challenges to its execution. She explains how a careful balance of compassion and justice allows us to do good deeds, and keep our sanity.",00:15:31,15.516666666666667,218349,2008-10-31T04:17:00+00:00,"['charter for compassion', 'compassion', 'global issues', 'religion']","['Bahasa Indonesia', 'Català', 'Deutsch', 'English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Français canadien', 'Italiano', 'Lietuvių kalba', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'Svenska', 'Tiếng Việt', 'Türkçe', 'Ελληνικά', 'Русский', 'Українська', 'български', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'فارسى', 'हिन्दी', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語', '한국어']",Jackie Tabick,Spiritual leader,"{'00:05': 'One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he\'s lying there and he says, ""I really understand, and I really appreciate how one should love one\'s neighbor as one love\'s oneself. The only trouble is the people next door; I can\'t stand them."" This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.', '00:49': ""We all, I think, believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah, that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel, who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God, who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman. After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate? And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life? Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control."", '02:00': ""I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral, or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying, and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the person. And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes. And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion, then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi."", '03:01': 'And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war, or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis? I know some people who say ""Well, you know there\'s just so much out there -- I can\'t do anything, I\'m not going to even begin to try."" And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can\'t confront compassion anymore, and so they turn off the television and don\'t watch. In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.', '03:57': ""You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more."", '04:24': ""And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because, after all, God is just. Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized, if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist."", '04:59': 'So, God thought, ""Nope, I\'m going to create the world just with compassion."" And then God looked to the future and realized that, in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter. If you put boiling water in, it will shatter. What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.', '05:50': 'There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into action. So, like Snoopy, we can\'t just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: ""chesed.""', '06:25': ""All these three things, then, have to be melded together. The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds, but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity. You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots."", '07:13': ""This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail? It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation."", '08:02': ""And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement, we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things, that something I do here actually does matter in Africa, that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs."", '08:49': 'This ""18 minutes"" business, I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life -- the word ""life."" So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, ""In life, this is what\'s important in terms of compassion."" But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread, the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread, and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or ""matzah""? And they say ""It\'s 18 minutes."" Because that\'s how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean, ""dough becomes leaven""? It means it gets filled with hot air. What\'s matzah? What\'s unleavened bread? You don\'t get it.', '09:47': ""Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those, and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world."", '10:40': 'Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread, which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up. He said, ""God wants bread. That\'s it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.""', '11:31': 'And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, ""God, I don\'t know why you want this bread, but here you are."" And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home.', '11:53': 'The cleaner came into the synagogue. ""Oh God, I\'m in such trouble. I\'ve got children to feed. My wife\'s ill. I\'ve got no money. What can I do?"" He goes into the synagogue. ""God, will you please help me? Ah, what a wonderful smell."" He goes to the ark. He opens the ark. ""There\'s bread! God, you\'ve answered my plea. You\'ve answered my question."" Takes the bread and goes home.', '12:20': 'Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, ""I\'m an idiot. God wants bread? God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"" He rushes to the synagogue. ""I\'ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."" He goes in there, and it\'s not there. And he says, ""God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week, with raisins.""', '12:45': 'This went on for years. Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark. Every week, the cleaner would come. ""God you\'ve answered my plea again."" Take the bread. Take it home.', '12:59': 'Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said, you know, ""This is what\'s happening.""', '13:12': 'And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen. ""You mean God didn\'t want my bread?""', '13:22': 'And the poor man said, ""And you mean God didn\'t answer my pleas?""', '13:29': 'And the rabbi said, ""You\'ve misunderstood me. You\'ve misunderstood totally,"" he said. ""Of course, what you are doing,"" he said to the rich man, ""is answering God\'s plea that we should be compassionate. And God,"" he said to the poor man, ""is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give."" He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man\'s hands and said, ""Don\'t you understand?"" He said, ""These are the hands of God.""', '14:11': 'So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me, so that I can see the world clearly.', '15:14': 'And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.'}"

It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity, to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard, and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years, the blackboards were fine, but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them."", '01:00': ""And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth, because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk."", '01:33': '(Laughter)', '01:34': ""That's not what I'm here to talk about, but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about, I had recently come back from Jordan, where I had an amazing experience with a camel."", '01:53': '(Laughter)', '01:56': 'And we were in the desert.', '01:57': ""Richard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah."", '02:00': ""We were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep. There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert, the Jeep broke down. The guys got out, they put the hood up, they started working under the hood, got it going again. About a hundred yards, it broke down. This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed, we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert."", '02:38': 'And eventually, our worst nightmare happened: they flooded the engine. And they said, ""Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."" And we said, ""We get out and walk?"" One water bottle, remember, guys, four people. And they said, ""Yeah, yeah, we\'ll walk. We\'ll find some camels."" We got out and walked, and sure enough, about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill, and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering, and 10 dollars later, we had four camels. They went down like elevators; we got on them. They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them, got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels, and they started galloping. And if you\'ve ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride. There\'s also one other aspect about these camels. About every 10 steps, they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.', '03:31': '(Laughter)', '03:32': ""So we kept on going, and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination, where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators, we sort of clumsily get off, and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point, and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States."", '04:06': 'So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, ""You know, maybe I should bring a camel. It\'s the best designed animal in the world."" He went, ""Nah. I don\'t think we want to be bringing a camel."" And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said, ""I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up; take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.""', '04:39': 'So, I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there, and I took one look at this camel. It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.', '04:53': '(Laughter)', '04:56': ""Now, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut, it is a scary, scary thing to behold.

I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut, they're similar to seals in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose."", '07:13': 'KB: Ears?', '07:14': ""SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes, but there's the secondary -- I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer."", '07:53': ""Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand. Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves, but they do have one, like, big nail."", '08:36': '(Audience laughter)', '08:37': ""You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over.

So, what the hell."", '08:58': '(Audience laughter)', '08:59': 'Now, they will also defecate in certain areas.

We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance. I\'m guessing that he\'s at least 1,600 pounds. But I would put him closer to 2,000. He\'s basically a walking mulch pile.

One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now, what you also didn't see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?"", '11:34': ""I'm going to show you another film. But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee, it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it, please?"", '12:12': 'Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate.

Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose -- with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips -- that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump? Ogden Nash once wrote: ""The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two, or else the other way around. I\'m never sure. Are you?"" Here\'s a hint: Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn\'t store H2O. I\'m built to last. I\'m the go-to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won\'t sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF, enough to fry an egg. I\'m able to lose 40% of my weight without dying. (Most animals would if they lost half that much.) I\'ll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I\'m powerful. Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse -- And cover 26 miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand. (Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?) I\'m a good provider, too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese. ""Camels are like angels,"" a Bedouin once said.', '15:06': '(Applause)', '15:09': ""Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large, we really don't have to adapt to our environment; we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference, not just this year, but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it; it has to adapt to the environment."", '15:49': 'Ricky, thank you very much for having me.', '15:51': ""RW: That's terrific. Thank you.""}"

A few days later, when the summit had ended, the factories were humming again, the sky had again turned light grey. So newspapers started urging the government to make the blue skies permanent.

Eventually, the government acted, and by 2018, the bulk of the Chinese population had witnessed a decline in air pollution by 32 percent on average.', '01:52': 'When will we demand clean air in India?', '01:56': ""I have a six-year-old daughter. Every morning, when I drop her to the school bus stop, I have to remind her not to take off her mask. That's the kind of world we live in. One day she pointed me to an advertisement for a face wash, which claimed that the polluting particles lodged deeply in our skin could be miraculously washed off. But what of the particles lodged in our lungs? When it's difficult to make out the difference between the lung of a smoker and the lung of a nonsmoker, we have a real problem, because I can run an air purifier at home, but can I lock up my daughter at home?"", '02:33': ""Air pollution is the great leveler. It affects us all, rich and poor, city dweller or village folk, those living inland or those living on the coast, and it's affecting our health, our economic growth, our quality of life. In 2017, more than 1.2 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution. That's more than those deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria or diarrhea."", '03:01': 'At the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, my colleagues find that today, one in two Indians is breathing air that does not meet our air quality standards. And the economic impact of this public health crisis is more than 80 billion dollars every year. At CEEW, my colleagues find that 80 percent of Indians can breathe clean air if we adopted stringent pollution controls.', '03:28': ""So here is my vision for India. In 2027, when we are celebrating our 80th year of independence, can we ensure that, by then, 80 cities in India have reduced air pollution by 80 percent? Let's called this Mission 80-80-80, and this is possible, but the role of citizens is going to be critical. To combat air pollution, we have to create a democratic demand for clean air. We can make this happen."", '04:02': 'First, we have to educate ourselves. Low-cost sensors give us real-time information about the air quality, but we still need information about how to interpret it and how to act. So we need to target information to schools and children, to resident welfare associations, to the elderly, who are more at risk. You know, when the temperature outside is 30 degrees versus 40 degrees, we know how to dress, we know what to do, what not to do. We need, similarly, information on what precautions to take when the air quality outside is poor, very poor, severe or hazardous.', '04:39': ""Second, we need to become active monitors. Today, most Indian cities and much of rural India have no air quality monitoring at all. So we need to demand that air quality sensors are installed in every constituency. Today, in Parliament, who is going to stand up for us as the air quality warrior? When enforcement agencies land up at polluting sites or dust-spewing construction sites, their whack-a-mole approach doesn't always work, because as soon as their attention turns somewhere else, the offenders go back to business as usual. We citizens have to become the fire alarms. We have to demand emergency call-in numbers and specialized task forces that can respond in real time to pollution sites. So we need not just the authority but the enforcement strength to crack down."", '05:32': ""Third, we have to be prepared to pay a price, whether it's for cars using BS6 fuel or for more expensive electricity from cleaner power plants. Last year, just before Diwali, I took a surprise inspection of polluting industries in an unauthorized industrial area just outside of Delhi, and I found polluting firecrackers were being sold. The Supreme Court had mandated only green firecrackers could be sold, but those were nowhere to be found. But the polluting ones were available. Why? Because we were ready to buy. As citizens, we have to reduce the demand for these polluting products or be prepared to pay more for cleaner products."", '06:16': ""Fourth step: let's build some empathy for our fellow citizens. How much does it take to keep a night guard warm rather than force them to burn rubbish to stay warm in winter? Or, let's take farmers. You know, it's very easy to blame them for burning the stubble of the rice paddy crop every winter, which causes air pollution. It's much harder to understand that it's the combination of our agricultural policy and our groundwater crisis that often leaves the farmer with no option but to burn the stubble. So we need to draw in the urban poor laborer or the rural poor farmer into our collective call for clean air. Farmers come and tell us that they want to adopt sustainable agriculture, but they need some help."", '07:01': ""And fifth, we have to change our lifestyles. Yes, public transport is often not available, but the choice to buy a cleaner, less polluting private vehicle is ours. The choice to segregate and recycle household waste is ours. You know, in Surat after the 1994 plague, citizens there take pride in keeping their city one of the cleanest in the country. Down south in Mysore, public-private partnerships and citizen-led eco clubs are coming together to reduce, segregate and recycle waste in a manner that landfills can be eliminated altogether. Now I'm not saying that officials have no responsibility here, but it is our collective apathy that takes the pressure off of our parliamentarians, the bureaucrats or the enforcement agencies."", '07:54': 'Mission 80-80-80 will only begin when we demand it. We have to create a democratic demand for clean air, because citizens, you and me, can decide what kind of air we breathe.', '08:12': 'Thank you.', '08:13': '(Applause)', '08:18': 'SRK: Thank you so much. Tell me something: India, our country, do we have any advantages? Have we become aware of it earlier because of all the inputs from people like you?', '08:30': 'AG: Our biggest strength: our people and our ability to make change without always necessarily relying only on the government. And that strength of civil society and civil demand for a civilized living condition is, I think, our biggest asset. Then, all of those and more will happen.', '08:51': '(Applause)', '08:52': ""SRK: Thank you, Dr. Ghosh. Bless you for coming here. And it's very enlightening. Thank you very much, and all the best with 80-80-80."", '08:59': 'Dr. Ghosh, everyone. AG: Thank you.', '09:00': '(Applause)'}"

And some of us rely on technology to do our jobs. For a while, I thought of machines and the technologies that drive them as perfect tools that could make my work more efficient and more productive.', '00:20': 'But with the rise of automation across so many different industries, it led me to wonder: If machines are starting to be able to do the work traditionally done by humans, what will become of the human hand? How does our desire for perfection, precision and automation affect our ability to be creative?', '00:39': ""In my work as an artist and researcher, I explore AI and robotics to develop new processes for human creativity. For the past few years, I've made work alongside machines, data and emerging technologies. It's part of a lifelong fascination about the dynamics of individuals and systems and all the messiness that that entails. It's how I'm exploring questions about where AI ends and we begin and where I'm developing processes that investigate potential sensory mixes of the future. I think it's where philosophy and technology intersect."", '01:13': ""Doing this work has taught me a few things. It's taught me how embracing imperfection can actually teach us something about ourselves. It's taught me that exploring art can actually help shape the technology that shapes us. And it's taught me that combining AI and robotics with traditional forms of creativity -- visual arts in my case -- can help us think a little bit more deeply about what is human and what is the machine. And it's led me to the realization that collaboration is the key to creating the space for both as we move forward."", '01:46': 'It all started with a simple experiment with machines, called ""Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1."" I call the machine ""D.O.U.G."" for short. Before I built D.O.U.G, I didn\'t know anything about building robots. I took some open-source robotic arm designs, I hacked together a system where the robot would match my gestures and follow [them] in real time. The premise was simple: I would lead, and it would follow. I would draw a line, and it would mimic my line.', '02:14': ""So back in 2015, there we were, drawing for the first time, in front of a small audience in New York City. The process was pretty sparse -- no lights, no sounds, nothing to hide behind. Just my palms sweating and the robot's new servos heating up. (Laughs) Clearly, we were not built for this. But something interesting happened, something I didn't anticipate."", '02:37': ""See, D.O.U.G., in its primitive form, wasn't tracking my line perfectly. While in the simulation that happened onscreen it was pixel-perfect, in physical reality, it was a different story. It would slip and slide and punctuate and falter, and I would be forced to respond. There was nothing pristine about it. And yet, somehow, the mistakes made the work more interesting. The machine was interpreting my line but not perfectly. And I was forced to respond. We were adapting to each other in real time."", '03:06': ""And seeing this taught me a few things. It showed me that our mistakes actually made the work more interesting. And I realized that, you know, through the imperfection of the machine, our imperfections became what was beautiful about the interaction. And I was excited, because it led me to the realization that maybe part of the beauty of human and machine systems is their shared inherent fallibility. For the second generation of D.O.U.G., I knew I wanted to explore this idea. But instead of an accident produced by pushing a robotic arm to its limits, I wanted to design a system that would respond to my drawings in ways that I didn't expect."", '03:45': ""So, I used a visual algorithm to extract visual information from decades of my digital and analog drawings. I trained a neural net on these drawings in order to generate recurring patterns in the work that were then fed through custom software back into the machine. I painstakingly collected as many of my drawings as I could find -- finished works, unfinished experiments and random sketches -- and tagged them for the AI system. And since I'm an artist, I've been making work for over 20 years. Collecting that many drawings took months, it was a whole thing."", '04:18': ""And here's the thing about training AI systems: it's actually a lot of hard work. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes. But in doing the work, I realized a little bit more about how the architecture of an AI is constructed. And I realized it's not just made of models and classifiers for the neural network. But it's a fundamentally malleable and shapable system, one in which the human hand is always present. It's far from the omnipotent AI we've been told to believe in."", '04:46': ""So I collected these drawings for the neural net. And we realized something that wasn't previously possible. My robot D.O.U.G. became a real-time interactive reflection of the work I'd done through the course of my life. The data was personal, but the results were powerful. And I got really excited, because I started thinking maybe machines don't need to be just tools, but they can function as nonhuman collaborators. And even more than that, I thought maybe the future of human creativity isn't in what it makes but how it comes together to explore new ways of making."", '05:23': 'So if D.O.U.G._1 was the muscle, and D.O.U.G._2 was the brain, then I like to think of D.O.U.G._3 as the family. I knew I wanted to explore this idea of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale. So over the past few months, I worked with my team to develop 20 custom robots that could work with me as a collective. They would work as a group, and together, we would collaborate with all of New York City.', '05:46': 'I was really inspired by Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li, who said, ""if we want to teach machines how to think, we need to first teach them how to see."" It made me think of the past decade of my life in New York, and how I\'d been all watched over by these surveillance cameras around the city. And I thought it would be really interesting if I could use them to teach my robots to see. So with this project, I thought about the gaze of the machine, and I began to think about vision as multidimensional, as views from somewhere. We collected video from publicly available camera feeds on the internet of people walking on the sidewalks, cars and taxis on the road, all kinds of urban movement. We trained a vision algorithm on those feeds based on a technique called ""optical flow,"" to analyze the collective density, direction, dwell and velocity states of urban movement. Our system extracted those states from the feeds as positional data and became pads for my robotic units to draw on. Instead of a collaboration of one-to-one, we made a collaboration of many-to-many. By combining the vision of human and machine in the city, we reimagined what a landscape painting could be.', '06:56': 'Throughout all of my experiments with D.O.U.G., no two performances have ever been the same. And through collaboration, we create something that neither of us could have done alone: we explore the boundaries of our creativity, human and nonhuman working in parallel.', '07:12': ""I think this is just the beginning. This year, I've launched Scilicet, my new lab exploring human and interhuman collaboration. We're really interested in the feedback loop between individual, artificial and ecological systems. We're connecting human and machine output to biometrics and other kinds of environmental data. We're inviting anyone who's interested in the future of work, systems and interhuman collaboration to explore with us. We know it's not just technologists that have to do this work and that we all have a role to play."", '07:46': ""We believe that by teaching machines how to do the work traditionally done by humans, we can explore and evolve our criteria of what's made possible by the human hand. And part of that journey is embracing the imperfections and recognizing the fallibility of both human and machine, in order to expand the potential of both."", '08:07': ""Today, I'm still in pursuit of finding the beauty in human and nonhuman creativity. In the future, I have no idea what that will look like, but I'm pretty curious to find out."", '08:18': 'Thank you.', '08:19': '(Applause)'}"

However, the sound wasn’t coming from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered its unpredictable eruption?', '00:49': 'The story of any volcano begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, the consequences can be explosive.', '01:40': 'One of the most common causes of an eruption is an increase in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements and compounds, many of which are dissolved in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico.', '02:36': 'There are two known natural causes for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds into the mix. But bubbles can also form when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration of the compounds that form explosive bubbles.', '03:12': 'Not all eruptions are due to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change could increase volcanic activity.', '03:55': 'Finally, eruptions can occur when the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust can be stretched thin as continental plates shift away from each other.', '04:29': 'Unfortunately, knowing what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.'}"

But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies.', '00:49': 'Seemingly empty regions of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments, bits of rock, and, further out, ices.', '01:49': 'We’ve observed thousands of these disks in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together into larger and larger masses.', '01:59': 'Dust grains 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can only hold tiny things together.', '02:22': 'And there’s a problem: once dust clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow is the first mystery of dust bunnies.', '02:39': 'One theory looks to electrostatic charge to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, and UV photons knock electrons off of gas atoms within the disk, creating positive ions and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes clusters together, like repels like and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy particles can knock more electrons off of some dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, and clusters grow rapidly.', '03:28': 'But before long we reach another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form, how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust.', '04:37': 'Eventually the chondrule pellets get cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today.', '04:57': 'Ultimately, the seeds of everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t have been right for the formation of life on our planet.'}"

How are you doing?', '00:47': 'KG: Well, I find strength in action. And at the Fund, we have been, from day one on this crisis, leaning forward with everything we have to provide lifelines to countries, and that means to people and businesses. Already, we have received over 90 requests and we have offered, to 56 countries, critical financial packages.', '01:22': ""CA: You've described this pandemic as a crisis like no other. In what way a crisis like no other?"", '01:30': 'KG: Truly like no other. First, never before we will inflict on the economy consciously so much pain to fight a virus and save lives. We are asking businesses not to produce and consumers not to go out and consume. At the Fund, we labeled this ""the Great Lockdown."" Second, never before there would be such a rapid change of fortunes practically for everybody around the world. In January, I was in Davos, talking about ""anemic growth,"" growth of three percent. In April, during our spring meetings, it was already minus three percent. In January, we predicted 160 countries to have positive income per capita growth. Now it is 170 countries with negative income per capita growth. Now this, we call ""the Great Reversal."" Very painful. And three, uncertainty. We always live with uncertainty, Chris, but this time, it is the uncertainty of a novel coronavirus that policymakers have to integrate. We at the Fund combine epidemiological projections with our traditional macroeconomic modeling to see through that uncertainty. I must add to this, I very much hope that when we go on the other side in the recovery, we can use a new term and call it ""the Great Transformation."" Make the world a better place.', '03:35': ""CA: Well, I'll be excited to come on to that in a bit.

Is that a wise response?"", '03:58': 'KG: It is a necessity. And you don\'t hear the Fund often telling countries, ""Please, spend. Spend as much as you can."" And that is what we do now. We do add to that, ""And keep the receipts. Don\'t lose accountability to the citizens, to the tax payers."" The reason financial injection is necessary, these fiscal measures of almost nine trillion dollars are necessary, is because when the economy is standing still, unless there is help, unless there is monetary policy stimulus, firms are going to go massively bankrupt, people would be unemployed, the economy would be scarred. When we go to the other side, this scarring is going to make the recovery much more difficult. So that is a wise thing to do, and it helps the fact that central banks in major economies have been acting in a synchronized manner and that fiscal stimulus came really, really fast. This is how we see people being able to go through this very, very tough time.', '05:20': 'CA: But how far can it go? Because it\'s been described, in a sense, as ""printing money"" -- governments are issuing more and more bonds that have to paid back at some point. There\'s this term, in economics, of the Minsky moment, where things can go very well for a while, as everyone believes that, you know, that the train can keep running, the cycle can keep turning, you know, that governments have all this money. At some point, though, doesn\'t that break down? Do you worry that we may be nearing a Minsky moment, where, like Michael in Mary Poppins grabs his tuppence and starts a run on the bank. Is there stress in the international financial system now that concerns you, that makes you feel that we may be running out of headroom?', '06:08': ""KG: Of course, this cannot go on forever. I, for one, have trust in our scientists, I think we will see breakthroughs, and we will see also people in businesses getting accustomed to social distancing, to micromeasures that protect from spreading the disease. We have seen very massive injection in health systems, so hospitals can actually treat people that are coming for help. Obviously, if it is to go for a very long time, we would be worried. For now, what we are projecting is that there would be a gradual reopening -- we see it already happening in a number of countries. And we project for next year, 2021, a partial recovery. Not a full recovery, unfortunately, but coming to a better place. Now, what helps us is something that I don't particularly love, but I see it as a positive feature -- very low interest rates, in some cases, negative -- that allows this injection of fiscal measures and liquidity to be sustained over a number of years. And for now, we do not see on the horizon any return to increase in interest rates. So low for longer, and that is, in that environment, a helpful feature."", '07:51': ""CA: I mean, the financial crisis of 2008 came perilously close to breaking the entire financial system -- arguably, it did that. By most people's calculation, this is a far worse impact to the economy overall. Did the world learn something from 2008 that has helped us so far be resilient this time?"", '08:14': 'KG: What the world learned is that the financial system has to be tested and then strengthened to withstand shocks. And that is helping us tremendously today. The banking system is resilient, and even in the nonbanking financial institutions, there is more attention paid to how far can you go without running into trouble. I would say, if you look around the world, the most important lesson then was ""build resilience to shocks."" Those who have done it cope now better. And those who have not done it are in a much tougher spot. And actually, for the Fund, what we are praying is that we will come out of this crisis with this lesson about resilience being spread beyond the banking system, so we actually have this crisis-management mindset for a world that is inevitably going to be more shock-prone, because of climate and also because of the sheer density of economic and social life on our planet.', '09:42': ""CA: In your role, you're paying special attention to the situation in developing countries. And it does seem that they're facing a really terrible situation right now. Many of them have significant debt denominated in dollars. In the current crisis, their currencies are depreciating against the dollar, making it nigh impossible for them to execute the kind of injection, stimulus injections, that the rich countries are doing and seems to be the only way out. So that seems like a really dangerous cycle. Is there any way to break that cycle?"", '10:23': 'KG: Well, let me first separate countries that have built strong fundamentals. And now in this crisis, as we are receiving incoming data, not very many, but there are still some positive surprises, and they come from countries that have built stronger buffers, stronger fundamentals, have been more disciplined during good times. But indeed, we do see quite a number of emerging markets, developing countries, faced with multiple pressures. They had the hit from the coronavirus, many of them with weak health systems. Then, they have the high level of indebtedness, from before the crisis, which creates a much more difficult environment for them. Then, many of them are commodity exporters. Commodity prices, oil price, they went down very dramatically, that hits them again. Many rely on remittances. Remittances shrunk some 20 to 30 percent. And then you have a number of countries that are highly dependent on tourism. Tourism is the hardest hit sector, or one of the hardest hit. So, very tough for these countries, but this is why institutions like mine have been wisely created. The IMF, the World Bank, the regional development banks, we work very closely together in this crisis. The IMF, fortunately, that was one of the lessons from the 2008-2009 crisis -- make sure that in the center of the financial safety net is an IMF with financial strength. We have four times more money to lend today than we had then. From 250 billion to one trillion dollars. And of course, we are deploying these funds exactly for the countries that need us the most.', '12:34': 'And we did one more thing. With David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, we called for a debt moratorium for the poorest countries to their official bilateral creditors. And people tend to say, ""Oh, we don\'t work together, it\'s not good enough."" But here is an area where we made this call in late March, and in mid-April, the G20 agreed on this moratorium. Amazing, we had the Paris Club, China, the Gulf countries, all agreeing that we should not suffocate the poorest countries by asking them to pay their debts when their economies are standing still.', '13:23': ""CA: Is it possible that some developing countries are overdoing the lockdown policy? I mean, if large numbers of your citizens are already struggling to stay alive, isn't it almost like a death sentence to order them not to leave their homes?"", '13:39': 'KG: Well, Chris, one of the most heartbreaking conversations I would have is with leaders of countries where they have to stare in the face a choice of people dying from the virus or dying from hunger. And it is a very dramatic situation for them. Where you have a very large part of your economy being informal, where people live hand-to-mouth every day, the lockdowns we have in advanced economies are not quite applicable, but even there, countries are doing really well in social distancing to the extent it is possible. Many of the countries in Africa were very early to step up preventive measures. Why? They learned from the Ebola, they learned from prior crises that hygiene, taking any measure you can really helps. So again, I cannot stress enough how important is solidarity with these countries. How important it is for my institution to be there for them in a timely manner. And we do it.', '14:57': 'CA: Whitney.', '14:59': ""Whitney Pennington Rogers: Hi there, thank you, this is a wonderful conversation, and we're starting to see some questions coming from the community. The first one we have is from Bill Elkus, and it's a follow-up to something you were mentioning earlier, related to the stimulus, Kristalina. What are the prospects for inflation from such a large stimulus?"", '15:20': ""KG: At this point, we are not worried about inflation in advanced economies and in the majority of emerging market economies. We do worry about inflation in countries that have weak fundamentals, no access to foreign exchange easily, where the only way to address the crisis is our help or their central banks printing more money. And sometimes it's a combination of those two. Why I don't worry about inflation in advanced economies? Because countries that have their hard currency are putting liquidity in place, but at the same time, they're not seeing a big expansion of demand and prices being pushed up. So for these countries, at least for the observable future, we don't see a way of going, like after the Second World War, in inflation jumping up. The consumers are not consuming so aggressively, demand is not that strong, and these are societies where there is a lot of maturity in how they exercise their policy options. But if you are a poor country, that out of desperation, with no access to markets, no access to hard currency, ought to somehow put money supply enough, then inflation is going to be there. A very extreme case is Zimbabwe, and I do worry there may be other countries. So this is why we are so determined to engage with these countries early. And also look at some of the high-debt countries. Would it be necessary, on a country-by-country basis, to restructure debts to prevent that moving in a desperate direction?"", '17:52': 'WPR: Thank you. And we have one more question that I wanted to share from our community. This is from Keith Yamashita, and it\'s about how we all can be involved in some of this change. ""You are tasked with macro-economic and funding efforts. What should we do as citizens to help renewal and recovery?""', '18:08': 'KG: Well, it is incredibly important for all of us citizens -- and aside of being the head of the IMF, I am also a global citizen -- that we are to bring that notion of solidarity in a moment of crisis. I loved the way this segment was musically backed, and it was ""Lean on Me."" It is very important that we do create that sense -- ""we are in this together, we will get through it together."" And please, speak up on that. I was, for many years, crisis commissioner, and one thing I learned is that the majority of people are positive, good people. You can lean on them. And there is a minority that is hateful and fearful and also very loud. So, good people, speak up. Spread that sense of ""we are in this together, we\'ll get through it together.""', '19:30': ""WPR: Thank you. I'll come back later with other questions."", '19:35': ""CA: Kristalina, I'd love to expand on that and just ask you a bit more about leadership, actually. You know, when people think of the nations that have performed best, they often refer to -- when I say best, best in response to the current pandemic -- they often refer to Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Denmark and Norway. When they think of those that have performed worst, they often think of Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Sweden, Iran, Brazil, Russia and the United States. All of that second group are run by men, all but one of the first group are run by women. Is that a coincidence?"", '20:21': ""KG: Well, now, speaking a bit subjectively as a woman, I do believe that women are great to lead in a crisis. They are more likely to show empathy, to care about the most vulnerable people and to be able to speak about that. They are decisive. I can say that for myself, we take energy from action. And we don't tend to, kind of, mourn and complain too much. So there is perhaps something to be said about the value of gender equality for the future. Bring more women for this world of more crisis ahead of us."", '21:24': 'CA: It\'s obviously hard to make generalizations about gender of any kind, but I mean, is there also, almost, something about the embracing of nuance, that women might be better at that than men? Men are often, it\'s like, ""let\'s win, let\'s conquer,"" and in a situation like this, where it\'s all probabilities, it\'s like, there are so many complex dials to turn on this dangerous pandemic machine that we\'re trying to wrestle. I mean, are women better at handling nuance?', '21:56': 'KG: Let me say something, Chris. We need everybody, and we need this mixture of experience, knowledge and predisposition. Men and women coming together. I find it that it is great to have different perspectives when we make decisions. Then, the chances of making a good decision are higher. So we need each other, but we also need to recognize is that yes, there are certain things, I have seen it time and again, women are more willing to find a pathway to compromise, they\'re more willing to be corrected if they\'re wrong. Say, ""Oh, OK, that\'s a good point, let me integrate it in the way I think about it."" And when you are in uncertainty, that is a huge advantage in decision-making.', '22:54': ""CA: So perhaps talk a bit more about your own leadership in this moment. I mentioned you've only recently come to this job. Before that, you were European Commissioner, you dealt with humanitarian crises in more than one part of the world. And in your own country, Bulgaria, you witnessed the wholesale transformation of the country, both politically and economically. What lessons can you bring from your past experience to this moment?"", '23:21': 'KG: Well, there are many things I learned. I was very fortunate to have these multiple experiences for the job I have now. But let me highlight three.', '23:33': 'First, how critically important it is to prepare for a crisis. Kind of, think of the unthinkable, and then act with some foresight when a shock hits you. You have a title for this series called ""Build Back Better."" I actually would like to modify it, if I may, and I would talk about ""Build Better Before."" Preparedness, prevention, pay off big time.', '24:17': 'The second -- and not necessarily in priority, it is as important -- is collective action, working together. Seeking help, offering help. Makes a huge difference in an emergency.', '24:36': ""And the third is something I learned time and again. We don't know our internal strength until we are hit. We are so resilient, we are so able to withstand shocks, especially when we come together, that this always gives me this sense of optimism that, as hard as it is, we can overcome it. From the days when my country collapsed, the economy collapsed, I would get up at four o'clock in the morning, queue to buy milk for my daughter, to the days when I would see Syrian refugees in terrible situations helping each other, to today, when I'm the head of the IMF, that internal strength, our power of resilience, the more we are together, the more it is amplified."", '25:44': 'CA: Actually, could you talk a bit more about the role of the IMF, especially as we look forward to trying to recover from this? What specifically can your organization do to take us forward?', '25:56': 'KG: So there are three things that are quite unique for the IMF, and they\'re really so important in a time of crisis. The first one is to give a good diagnostic of what is happening and what is the way forward. Let me just say, in this crisis, in the very first weeks, we put together, we call it policy action tracker, for 193 countries. What actions are countries taking, how they can learn from each other, so we can be more effective together. We are adding to it, now, actions for responsible reopening of the economies exactly with that purpose. What we are known best for, we are the financial first responder. We are coming in this incredible shock with very significant financial firepower. And what people don\'t know is that the Fund has multiple instruments. Emergency financing is the one we doubled for this crisis. And it is no conditionalities. We are asking one thing, Chris. Pay your doctors and your nurses, your hospitals, protect your most vulnerable people and parts of the economy. That\'s it, this is the condition. And the third thing we do at the Fund is to help countries have the capacity for good policies. After the financial crisis, we helped many countries to have good debt management, good fiscal management, transparency and accountability to improve the performance of public finance. So the Fund is not a very big organization by any standard, we are some 3,000 people. Highly professional, incredibly committed. When you use the expression ""all hands on deck,"" that\'s us. And it is a digital deck, it is a digital deck these days.', '28:07': ""CA: I mean, this is a global crisis. A lot of people are worried that unlike perhaps even in 2008, where it really did seem there was a lot of global cooperation, there's actually, in some worrying ways, less this time? Are you worried about how crucial is that to getting us through this?"", '28:26': ""KG: I mean, my preoccupation is, in our mandate, in my area of responsibility, bring the membership together. We have almost the whole world, 189 countries are our members, and so far, I am very impressed by how responsive the membership has been. I put in front of them in the spring a package, very strong package of measures to expand the role of the IMF in the crisis. Everything that we ask for -- we ask for doubling emergency financing, we got it. Very interesting. We ask for tripling concession of financing. Exactly because, you know, like the virus hits people with a weak system the hardest, the crisis hits weak economies the hardest. So we wanted to triple concession of financing. Within one month, we got it. We asked for grants for debt relief, we got it. So what I'm trying to say here is that we need to focus on ways in which we bring the world together. And then act on that. Rather than complaining that maybe not everything is the way it should be, do your duty to the global community."", '29:55': 'CA: Well, indeed. And the IMF is dependent on the financing from its members, its key members.', '30:02': 'KG: Yes.', '30:04': ""CA: I mean, you spoke of the trillion dollars that you are looking to make available to nations that need it. As I read it, that comes from -- you've got these units called Special Drawing Rights. You basically draw a currency from members. And hasn't there been pushback, though, from the US, to block that effort of raising all that money?"", '30:27': ""KG: So the one trillion dollars is from our quotas and also from our ability to move money from well-to-do members from the advanced economies and lend it at very low or zero interest to the developing emerging markets. And we had this one trillion and what was very interesting, not everybody noticed that -- the US, in their two trillion dollars stimulus package, included the support for the IMF. The Special Drawing Rights is something that we, indeed, don't have yet consensus among the membership to do. It was done during the 2009 crisis, issuing liquidity, and it goes to everybody. And there are many voices, including mine -- I spoke to the G20 about that -- that are saying, well, that may be a good thing to do now. It is not being supported for reasons. It is not just capriciously."", '31:42': 'The problem with Special Drawing Rights is that when we issue them, they go to all members, and the advanced economies get 62 percent of the new allocation, and there are some that are saying, ""Can we think of something that is more directed, or exclusively directed to those who need it?"" But, Chris, everything is on the table for us. As the crisis unfolds, we need to do more, we bring the membership to do more.', '32:17': 'CA: Whitney.', '32:19': 'WPR: We actually have a question from the community that builds on what you\'re discussing right now. Yavnika Khanna asks, ""Which countries will prove to be resilient in the Great Transformation: those with popular leaders or those with sound financial systems?""', '32:34': ""KG: You know, they both matter. Countries with strong fundamentals are clearly going through this crisis with less trauma than those that had weak fundamentals to begin with. And of course, leadership matters. How you mobilize a country for action matters. In my view, what we would see on the other side, the winners would be those who think today of this crisis also as an opportunity. Clearly, digital transformation is a huge opportunity. Moving to e-learning, e-government, e-payments, e-commerce, linking small and medium-sized enterprises through digital to consumers, big winner. Secondly, I very much hope that we would come on the other side with a low carbon footprint and a more climate-resilient economy. Those who move in this direction, they would reduce the risk for themselves and the world. From this other crisis, that we are not talking so much about these days, but it hasn't gone anywhere. And you know, if you don't like pandemic, you are not going to like the climate crisis at all. And also, countries that are thinking of how to make the economy in the future a fairer economy. In other words, we have been seeing inequality building up before this crisis. My colleagues who have researched pandemics have a very bitter lesson for us. After pandemics, after H1N1, after SARS, after Zika, inequality goes up. Well, are we going to let inequality to go up, up, after this crisis? And if we do, we are damaging the fabric of our societies, and my sense is that hundreds of millions of people in this crisis would much prefer to have a simpler, fairer, more equitable world to live in, and definitely, a more sustainable world."", '35:19': 'CA: Mm.', '35:20': 'KG: Those would be the winners.', '35:24': 'WPR: Definitely. And just one more question from our community, before turning it back to Chris for some final questions here. You know, this one is from Sarah Rugheimer. And the question is, ""What do you see as the main potential positive shifts / changes in this world from this pandemic, say, two to 10 years from now?""', '35:47': 'KG: Well, I touched upon it a little bit. First, I hope to see fiscal policy to help us recover to be geared towards green recovery and more equitable recovery. And that is something that is in the hands of policymakers. It can be done. Secondly, I very much hope to see us integrating what we have learned from the crisis, in terms of virtual work. My organization, the IMF, well, we can shrink our carbon footprint dramatically just by sustaining the practices we are developing now, and we will. I certainly hope to see, in the future, much more attention to two things that we saw in this crisis are essential. Universal access to health in some form, strong health systems, as well as strong social safety nets, built as automatic stabilizers in a time of shock. And by the way, it is cheaper if we do it in this way. The bill for everyone is going to be smaller. And also, I very much hope that this notion of investing in people, recognizing that now that we see this horrible tragedy, the loss of lives, that investing in people is the very best investment we can make.', '37:44': 'CA: Mm.', '37:46': ""WPR: That's great."", '37:48': 'CA: So, see you again in a minute, Whitney. Kristalina, it\'s so -- It\'s so inspiring, actually, hearing the energy and stuff, the energy that you\'re bringing to this. I don\'t think many people coming into this would have expected to hear, from the head of the IMF, this emphasis on, you know, ""Let\'s solve the climate crisis, let\'s tackle inequality and injustice."" Do you really believe that this moment, this crisis could help lead us into a great transformation? People will feel it\'s your job to sound positive, you have to do that. Do you really see the path forward that we can get through this, and what sort of timescale are we talking about here, Kristalina?', '38:44': ""KG: Well, you know, one thing I learned from the transition I lived through, the transition from central planning to markets, is it is tough, it is long, it is painful and it is a road that takes turns. So I don't have an expectation of miracle from here to there. But I genuinely believe that we are now in a point of our history when people demand from their leaders safety and security and a society that is not torn apart by conflicts. And that is actually not unusual to see. So, I would turn the table a little bit on you, Chris. After a war, we see the world coming together and building a better world. Why not after a pandemic? And yes, we can make mistakes and not take the right road to travel. But we certainly have an obligation to try to get on that road."", '40:08': 'CA: So if you could just inject --', '40:10': 'KG: And everybody matters for that.', '40:14': 'CA: So if you could inject one idea into the mind of everybody, or into to the world leaders who listen to you, what would that idea be at this moment?', '40:28': 'KG: Optimism. Build a better world. Possible, desirable, we must do it.', '40:42': ""CA: That sounds like optimism as the stance, not just a naive belief that it will happen, but a determination to make it so. That's what you're calling for. To use that as the motivation to pull us all forward together."", '40:54': ""KG: Chris, do I have one minute, or I'm done, I need to go?"", '40:59': 'CA: If you want to say one last thing in one minute, alright, go.', '41:05': 'KG: I want to say one thing. To recommend to the audience to watch the movie ""Bridge of Spies."" There is a part in the movie in which the two main actors, the lawyer and the Russian spy, talk to each other. The lawyer says, ""Things are very bad, it looks like you may hang."" The spy is very calm. Lawyer says, ""Aren\'t you worried?"" The spy answers, ""Would it help?""

In this moving talk, screenwriter and director Fernando Salem champions the lasting power of storytelling, speaking to the ways in which a well-crafted narrative can help kids learn and retain history.",,,210740,2019-03-01T23:35:32+00:00,"['history', 'storytelling', 'education', 'children', 'television']","['English', 'Español']",Fernando Salem,,"{'0:00': 'Well, I don\'t know about you guys, but for me, the part that I enjoyed the most about going to school is when they took us out on excursions or we went camping. I think I liked it a lot because in that moment you felt free, you could see your friends with the light of day, you could watch the teacher interact with the real world. But I think that the most important was that when we went on excursion learning and living were part of the same thing. I work as a director and screenwriter and in 2009 we had a problem. We had to ideate a TV show for kids that would tell the children about the May Revolution and the problem was that nothing came to us. To make things worse, with Sebastian Mignona and Nicolas Dardano, we have had the wonderful idea of offering to the Ministry of Education\'s TV channel to make an animated program; when none of us had the slightest idea on how to create a cartoon film. If you asked me when I was a boy what I wanted to do when I grew older, I would answer: ""I want to work making cartoons."" But it seems that with time I began noticing that animations were done in the United States. So if I wanted that work, I would have to be far from my parents, and I likely gave up. But now, I had the chance to write and direct a cartoon. So, a bit to reconnect myself with what I liked so much from the school, and also, I think, to see if an idea would occur to me, I went alone on an excursion to the Buenos Aires\' Cabildo. I arrive at the Cabildo, I go up to the first floor, turn left, and I find this image. The Primera Junta, and so I get closer, read the names, Saavedra, Moreno, Castelli, Belgrano, Paso, I look at their expressions, their faces, and there I had the first revelation. ""This is a pain."" (Laughter) There\'s no way -- (Applause) There\'s no way you can do something entertaining with this. The kids will always prefer to watch Pokemon, or Dragon Ball Z. If you think of it, they are able to store in their brain five complete seasons of Pokemon in Japanese, they watch the movies they like a million five hundred thousand times and they know the words by heart. And what is the difference between that content and this? Could we make the May Revolution as attractive as that? It seems that in front of content presented as pedagogical, educational, you lift a barrier. Like when they want to sell you something you do not need. There, I noticed that I passed through elementary and middle school without understanding well why San Martin crossed the Andes. And they must have explained it to me every August 17th. But it didn\'t hit me, I didn\'t get it, or it did not stick. When I returned from the Cabildo, I started thinking: ""So, what stuck with me from school?"" And then comes the image of my favorite teacher. You may as well have a favorite teacher from elementary or middle school. Well, Claudio Simari was mine. He was my teacher from 4th grade. And I was reminded of him because he was able to overcome the barrier that I had placed. And I remembered two moments where Claudio did it. And maybe in that there was an idea to create this cartoon. One morning Claudio arrived and he put on a piece of music. Claudio chose a song by Terea Parodi that was called ""Hurry up Jose,"" and he wanted to explain to us the drama of the floods in Formosa. For those who don\'t know it, the song recounts a desperate call from a woman to her husband to escape together before the flood arrives. That was enough for me to never forget about the floods of Formosa. And for each time I listen to ""Hurry up Jose,"" to be moved again. The other thing I remember about Claudio is that one day he decided to share with us a personal story. And he must have done it in such a sensitive way that I can even remember where I was sitting in the classroom. It turned out that Claudio was being sent to the war. Claudio was in the line to enter the plane that was going to take him to the Falkland Islands. He already had his uniform on, it was dawn, and he suddenly looks and he notices his parents had just arrived to say goodbye. So Claudio went running from the line to give a final hug, and when he returned they sent him to the back. And he was one of the few that failed to enter the plane. Those were the last flights that managed to reach the islands, and a friend of Claudio died in combat. With that alone, I would never forget the Falklands war, neither that history. How did Claudio do it? How did he impart on us ideas that 30 years later I still keep remembering? I realized one thing. What Claudio did, first of all, was to tell us stories. And we lived them like we were there with him. Claudio was a sort of medium, and we lived that experience we were in the classroom but we felt on an adventure. And the other thing I realized of Claudio is that he never underestimated us. We always thanked him for that, because Claudio didn\'t treat us like infants. We preferred Claudio over those men and women in television who would disguise as boys or girls. At first, they\'d come closer to become your friends, and then you realize that they want to teach you numbers or colors, or sell you something. Seems like Claudio knew that if you treat a child like a fool, you ran the risk that, whether the child thinks that you are the fool, because you\'re speaking to them like that, or that they grow up thinking they are a fool, which is much worse. Children can be lovely, tender, sensitive, but the truth is they are the same who invented bullying. They can be tyrants, cruel, fickle beings, just like us. If they are like us, then why should we treat them in a different way? Now, how are we? That was the question that we asked ourselves in that moment. One of my first assignments as director of ""The Dog on the Moon"" -- way before creating ""Zamba"" -- was traveling across the country visiting public schools and interviewing kids. I must have interviewed around 1,500 or 2,000 kids. They taught me to stop looking at them from above, to lower the camera, to look at them in the eyes, and to see the world as they see it. That ended up having a lot of impact in the project, because there is something from each of those kids in Zamba. Anyone who had contact with Argentina\'s hinterland knows that the representation of children we see on TV is quite different from reality. Of course, because TV is designed to treat children as consumers. Paka-Paka comes to treat children like children, and for us as storytellers, that was an incredible opportunity. So we started to design the character. We had to think of an Argentine boy. If you were to draw an Argentine boy, what would you do? What would the hair color be? His skin color? What would the width of the nose be? These are the first sketches of Zamba. At that time we asked ourselves if boys and girls would identify with a boy who did not have super powers, and that instead of a cape, he wears a pinafore like them. Finally, this is the definitive design of Zamba. (Applause) We made him short like Messi for agility and to facilitate escaping. He has a backpack so he\'s similar to those hectic kids that are running around with their backpack on. We put on his pajamas under his pinafore. We made his skin brown. If you look carefully, he has like some little horns here, to make it look a bit more mischievous. And we gave him a broken tooth, as a war wound of that battle we all go through and is called ""infancy."" At this point, you should be asking: ""How is it that a guy who went through elementary or middle school without knowing why San Martin had crossed the Andes, can write and direct a program on history?"" Gabriel Di Meglio, who is a historian and researcher at the CONICET, was on the team. Gaby, among other things, chose to be a historian because in his childhood he read Asterix. And I had the chance to sit with him, face to face, and ask him about history in the same way Zamba asks San Martin. Then, what at first seemed a hindrance ended up being an advantage because I could write Zamba from naivety, without solemnity. We could get our heroes off their horses, we could brush off the bronze; we could tell our history through humor. Today, we live in a time of peace. But throughout our history a lot of men and women lost their lives, the only life they had, to fight for values like freedom and independence. And they could not see the outcome of that struggle. It hurt me, for example, when I came to know that Belgrano died in a period of anarchy, with the feeling that all he had done had rendered useless. But it was useful. To all who do Zamba, we like to think that Belgrano, San Martin, Sarmiento or Juana Azurduy would like to know that those values of freedom and independence are moving on to the next generation. Today, kids recognize their struggles and recognize them as characters of Zamba on banknotes. (Applause) Zamba might be revolutionary? I have no idea. We can\'t know this by now. We may have to wait 20 or 30 years. And something similar must happen with teachers, right? How much time must pass so you can see the result of their efforts of their dedication? And when I was preparing this talk, tin! My favorite teacher, Claudio, comes to mind again. I said, ""Well, I have to tell him this, I have to share this with him."" So I googled him. Claudio did not have Facebook. And all I found was a very improbable e-mail account, and I wrote an email that said this I will read to you: ""Hello Claudio. I was your student 30 years ago, perhaps you don\'t remember me. I write you because I\'m one of the makers of a cartoon called Zamba, it\'s shown in Paka-Paka and I have to give a talk about it. I needed to tell you that Zamba is named Jose after ""Hurry up, Jose"" the song that one day you showed us to explain the flooding in Formosa. And that\'s also why Zamba is from Clorinda. I needed you to know that if you watch the episode about the Falklands, you will find a veteran teacher and it is a tribute to you. If by chance you see this mail I hope you are doing well and that you receive a little recognition and appreciation for the work you did with us."" (Applause) Today, was approaching and Claudio\'s reply did not come. And very recently it arrived. Claudio is still the guy I remembered. He went to live in Bariloche, he was a rural teacher, he devoted his life to teaching and he now works there at a center of teacher training. What was I supposed to do? I went to meet him. And it turns out that when I arrived, Claudio had a surprise for me. I did not remember, but on the last day of school Claudio asked us to write what we liked most of 4th grade. And these 30 years Claudio had treasured my answer and my peers\'. (Applause) ""What I liked about the year -- I wrote -- was the camp, because we played a lot and had fun."" Today, Claudio is here sitting among us. (Applause) And I have the possibility to thank Claudio personally and in front of you those gestures, that dedication, that one day he made us listen to a song, that one day he shared with us such a personal and intimate history as that of the Falklands war. Because those little things helped, they are what ultimately make that future engineers, future scientists, future teachers, future artists, workers, and perhaps even future presidents, today, at school, when they go out to recess they end up shouting: ""Let us be free, nothing else matters."" (Applause)'}"

The psychic told me my heart carries too much weight Said for 20 dollars she’d tell me what to do I handed her the twenty, she said “stop worrying darling, you will find a good man soon.” The first psychotherapist said I should spend 3 hours a day sitting in a dark closet with my eyes closed and my ears plugged. I tried it once but couldn’t stop thinking about how gay it was to be sitting in the closet. The yogi told me to stretch everything but truth, said focus on the outbreaths, said everyone finds happiness if they can care more about what they can give than what they get. The pharmacist said klonopin, lamictil, lithium, Xanax. The doctor said an antipsychotic might help me forget what the trauma said The trauma said don’t write this poem. Nobody wants to hear you cry about the grief inside your bones But my bones said “Tyler Clementi dove into the Hudson River convinced he was entirely alone.” My bones said “write the poem.” To the lamplight.

After months of strategic planning and controversy, thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C. Here, they called for a constitutional amendment granting them the right to vote.', '00:43': 'By 1913, women’s rights activists had been campaigning for decades. As a disenfranchised group, women had no voice in the laws that affected their– or anyone else’s– lives. However, they were struggling to secure broader support for political equality. They’d achieved no major victories since 1896, when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women. That brought the total number of states which recognized a women’s right to vote to four.', '01:11': 'A new, media-savvy spirit arrived in the form of Alice Paul. She was inspired by the British suffragettes, who went on hunger strikes and endured imprisonment in the early 1900s. Rather than conduct costly campaigns on a state-by-state basis, Paul sought the long-lasting impact of a constitutional amendment, which would protect women’s voting rights nationwide.', '01:33': 'As a member of the National American Women Suffrage Association, Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip up support and rejuvenate the movement. Washington authorities initially rejected her plan- and then tried to relegate the march to side streets. But Paul got those decisions overturned and confirmed a parade for the day before the presidential inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. This would maximize media coverage and grab the attention of the crowds who would be in town.', '01:59': 'However, in planning the parade, Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds, including those who were racist. She actively discouraged African American activists and organizations from participating- and stated that those who did so should march in the back.', '02:15': 'But black women would not be made invisible in a national movement they helped shape. On the day of the march, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a ground-breaking investigative journalist and anti-lynching advocate, refused to move to the back and proudly marched under the Illinois banner. The co-founder of the NAACP, Mary Church Terrell, joined the parade with the 22 founders of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, an organization created by female students from Howard University. In these ways and more, black women persevered despite deep hostility from white women in the movement, and at great political and physical risk.', '02:52': 'On the day of the parade, suffragists assembled to create a powerful exhibition. The surging sections of the procession included international suffragists, artists, performers and business-owners. Floats came in the form of golden chariots; an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map of enfranchised countries. On the steps of the Treasury Building, performers acted out the historical achievements of women to a live orchestra.', '03:16': 'The marchers carried on even as a mob blocked the route, hurling insults and spitting at women,  tossing cigars, and physically assaulting participants. The police did not intervene, and in the end, over 100 women were hospitalized.', '03:31': 'Their mistreatment, widely reported throughout the country, catapulted the parade into the public eye—  and garnered suffragists greater sympathy. National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated their actions during the parade. After the protest, the ""Women’s Journal"" declared, “Washington has been disgraced. Equal suffrage has scored a great victory.""', '03:53': 'In this way, the march initiated a surge of support for women’s voting rights that endured in the coming years. Suffragists kept up steady pressure on their representatives, attended rallies, and petitioned the White House.', '04:05': 'Inez Milholland, the woman on the white horse, campaigned constantly throughout the United States, despite suffering from chronic health problems.

According to popular reports, her last words were, “Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?”', '04:29': 'Though full voting inclusion would take decades, in 1920, Congress ratified the 19th amendment, finally granting women the right to vote.'}"

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand.', '00:30': 'What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already in our grasp.', '00:55': 'Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time. Instead of starting with metal, plastic, or ceramic, a 3-D printer for organs and tissues uses bioink: a printable material that contains living cells.', '01:19': 'The bulk of many bioinks are water-rich molecules called hydrogels. Mixed into those are millions of living cells as well as various chemicals that encourage cells to communicate and grow. Some bioinks include a single type of cell, while others combine several different kinds to produce more complex structures.', '01:41': 'Let’s say you want to print a meniscus, which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keeps the shinbone and thighbone from grinding against each other. It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of them for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a patient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based bioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle attached to a printhead. It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely wider than 400 microns in diameter, and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness of a human fingernail.', '02:35': 'A computerized image or file guides the placement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a liquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place until it stabilizes. These printers are fast, producing the meniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time.', '02:53': 'After printing, some bioinks will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging nutrients, and multiplying.', '03:15': 'We can already print relatively simple structures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have also been successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial nerve regeneration in rats. Researchers have created lung tissue, skin, and cartilage, as well as miniature, semi-functional versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge. Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the ink if the nozzle is too small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients to all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the greatest successes so far have been with structures that are flat or hollow— and why researchers are busy developing ways to incorporate blood vessels into bioprinted tissue.', '04:17': 'There’s tremendous potential to use bioprinting to save lives and advance our understanding of how our organs function in the first place. And the technology opens up a dizzying array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with embedded electronics. Could we one day engineer organs that exceed current human capability, or give ourselves features like unburnable skin? How long might we extend human life by printing and replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology and its incredible output?'}"

From our early work on 4D printing, where we printed objects, dipped them underwater, and they transform, to our active auxetics that respond to temperature and sunlight, to our more recent work on active textiles that respond to body temperature and change porosity, to our rapid liquid printing work where we print inflatable structures that morph based on air pressure and go from one shape to another, or our self-assembly work where we dip objects underwater, they respond to wave energy and assemble themselves into precise objects like furniture.', '00:51': ""Or, at larger scales, using wind energy, we have meter-diameter weather balloons that assemble in the airspace above a construction site. For dangerous environments or harsh, extreme places where it's hard to get people or equipment, they can assemble in the airspace, and as the helium dies, they then come back to the ground, and you're left with a big space frame structure."", '01:11': 'All of this research is about taking simple materials, activating them with forces in their environment -- gravity, wind, waves, temperature, sunlight -- and getting them to perform, getting them to transform, assemble, etc. How do we build smart things without complex electromechanical devices?', '01:30': ""But more recently we were approached by a group in the Maldives, and they were interested in taking some of this research and ways of thinking and applying it to some of the challenges that they've faced in terms of climate change. And the first thing you do when you're approached by someone in the Maldives is say you want to go on a site visit."", '01:46': '(Laughter)', '01:47': 'It is amazing.', '01:49': ""So we went there and I actually walked away with a really different perspective on the future of climate change. Because you would imagine, you know, the Maldives are sinking. They're screwed. What are they going to do? But I walked away thinking, they might be the model, the future model of the built environment, where they can adapt and be resilient rather than our fixed, man-made infrastructure."", '02:08': ""But there's typically three main approaches to sea level rise and climate change. One of them is that we can do nothing and we can run away. And that's a pretty bad idea. As more than 40 percent of the world's population is living in coastal areas, as sea levels rise and as storms get worse and worse, we're going to be more and more underwater. So it's imperative that we solve this pretty demanding problem."", '02:30': ""The second is that we can build barriers. We can build walls. The problem here is that we take a static solution trying to fight against a superdynamic, high-energy problem, and nature is almost always going to win. So that's likely not going to work either."", '02:47': ""The third approach is using dredging. So dredging is where you suck up a bunch of sand from the deep ocean and you pump it back onto the beaches. If you go to any beach around the Northeast or Western Coast, you'll see that they use dredging year after year after year just to survive. It's really not a good solution."", '03:03': ""In the Maldives, they do the same thing, and they can build an island in a month, a brand new island they build from dredging. But it's really, really bad for the marine ecosystem, and then they become addicted to dredging. They need to do that year after year."", '03:16': ""But in the time that it took them to build that one island, three sandbars built themselves, and these are massive amounts of sand so big you can park your boat on it, and this is what's called a site visit. It's really hard work."", '03:29': '(Laughter)', '03:31': 'In Boston winters. This is massive amounts of sand that naturally accumulates just based on the forces of the waves and the ocean topography.', '03:42': ""So we started to study that. Why do sandbars form? If we could tap into that, we could understand it and we could utilize it. It's based on the amount of energy in the ocean and the topography in the landscape that promotes sand accumulation. So what we're proposing is to work with the forces of nature to build rather than destroy, and in my lab at MIT, we set up a wave tank, a big tank that's pumping waves, and we placed geometries underwater. We tried all sorts of different geometries. The waves interact with the geometry, and then create turbulence and start to accumulate the sand so the sand starts to form these sandbars on their own. Here's an aerial view. On the left-hand side, you'll see the beach that's growing. In the middle you'll see the sandbar that formed. So these are geometries that collaborate with the force of the wave to build."", '04:28': ""We then started to fabricate one. This was in February in Boston. We have large rolls of canvas. It's a biodegradable material, it's super cheap, easy to work with. We then sew it into these large bladders, and then we flew over there. And I know what you're thinking. This is not the Fyre Festival."", '04:45': '(Laughter)', '04:47': ""This is real life. It's real. And we flew there with these canvas bladders in our suitcases, we got sunburned because it was Boston winter, and then we filled them with sand and we placed them underwater. These are exactly the same geometries that you saw in the tank, they're just human scale. Large objects filled with sand, we'd place them underwater, they're just really simple geometries. In the front of them, you'll see it's clear water. The waves are crashing over. It's quite clear. And then on the backside, there's turbulence. The water and the sand is mixing up. It's causing sediment transport, and then the sand is accumulating. You'll see some friendly stingrays here that visited us. On the left is day one, the right is day three. You'll see the sand ripples in the light areas where the sand is accumulating just after two days."", '05:35': ""So this was last February, and it's very much ongoing work. This is just in the beginning of this research. Over the next year and longer, we're going to be studying this through satellite imagery and bathymetry data to understand what the short-term and long-term impacts are of natural sand accumulation in the environment. And the bigger vision, though, is that we want to build submersible geometries, almost like submarines that we can sink and float. Like adaptable artificial reefs, you could deploy them if there's a storm coming from one direction or another or if the seasons are changing, you can use these adaptable reef structures to use the force of the waves to accumulate sand. And we think this could be used in many coastal regions and many island nations around the world."", '06:20': ""But when we think about building smarter environments, think of smarter buildings or smarter cars or smarter clothing, that typically means adding more power, more batteries, more devices, more cost, more complexity and ultimately more failure. So we're always trying to think about how do we build smarter things with less? How do we build smarter things that are simple? And so what we're proposing at the lab and with this project specifically is to use simple materials like sand that collaborates with forces in the environment like waves to accumulate and adapt."", '06:54': ""And we'd like to work with you, collaborate with us, to develop this, to scale it and apply this way of thinking. We think it's a different model for climate change, one that's about adaptation and resilience rather than resistance and fear. So help us turn natural destruction into natural construction."", '07:13': 'Thank you.', '07:14': '(Applause)'}"

I'm a fashion photographer based in New York City. I've worked for lots of different magazines in New York, I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire, and for Interview and for GQ, and I got to work with some really beautiful people. My studio is in New York, but I also lived in Milan for about eight years, and in Paris as well, and worked for the house of Yves St. Laurent. I also did portraiture as well. I've worked for lots of different magazines, lots of great clients."", '00:39': 'But I was always told, every single day, who was beautiful. I was forced to work within certain parameters of the beauty standard. I was told, ""This is the most amazing model of the moment, you\'ve got to photograph her. She\'s incredible, you\'ve got to."" And then the next season, it would change again, and I\'d have to shift my ideas of beauty, and so we\'d go to the next model, and it was kind of really crazy, because I\'m an artist. I saw beauty everywhere. I didn\'t see beauty just on a magazine cover. I did a shoot with, of course, Cindy, for Revlon, and really fantastic, beautiful people. But I thought, someone\'s always telling me who\'s beautiful. And I was kind of frustrated.', '01:16': 'I left my studio one afternoon in New York, and I was walking down Park Avenue, and I saw, waiting for a bus at the corner of Park and 20th, this gorgeous kid. She had long, white, beautiful hair, and pale, pale skin. She had a genetic condition called albinism. I didn\'t know much about it, but she was stunning, and I\'d never met a model like this before. And I went to grab her and say, ""I have to take your photograph, you\'re amazing!"" And the bus came, she got on, and then she took off, and I was really glad because she was 12, and I\'d be in prison at the moment. (Laughter)', '01:44': 'But really, it was extraordinary to see this kid. So I continued right down to Union Square, to the huge Barnes and Noble, and started pulling any books, or any information I could about this genetic condition, albinism. And I found really kind of sad images. I didn\'t find images of this kid. I found images of people sitting in hospital beds, looking sad, looking downtrodden, just images of despair. I found images of a bright red eye, the albino eye. I\'m thinking, this kid had beautiful blue eyes, she didn\'t have red eyes. And then I started seeing images from Africa, where kids were surrounded by tribes pointing spears at them or in cancer wards and clinics, or they\'re just in beds, and images of illness, of sadness, of sickness. And then, I started, of course, going through those same medical textbooks, and started finding these typical images of kids and adults in their underwear, against walls in doctor\'s offices, with the black bar across their eyes saying ""disease."" This is a disease, defined by a disease. And I was like, this is crazy. And then I started going into it further, looking on the Internet, and all these different medical textbooks, and everything was so sad, and so negative.', '02:51': 'I then started finding images of the albino freak family in the circus, and then of course, all the movie references, from ""Powder,"" who had albinism because his mother was struck by lightning, to ""The Princess Bride"" and to ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" there were the ghost-like twins that came in and wreaked havoc, and destroyed things and then disappeared. Even most recently, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" there was like the evil albino driving around Paris at night, killing people, shooting at people. Well, I found out, through my research, that people with albinism have a visual impairment. There\'s always vision, but they\'re considered legally blind. So they certainly wouldn\'t be driving around Paris at night shooting at anybody and expect to hit anything. So I\'m thinking, this is crazy.', '03:32': 'So I contact NOAH. Now, NOAH is the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation. It\'s a support group for people living with this condition, and their families. And I\'m like, ""Hey, I\'m a fashion photographer. Let\'s show the world the beauty of albinism!"" And they said, ""Get lost."" And I\'m pretty persistent. I\'m like, ""Won\'t you talk to me?"" And they made it very clear to me about their fears of exploitation, that every time there was a magazine article that came out about a kid with albinism, it was a story about a victim. It was sad, or it was exploitative, or sensational — never positive, always negative. And I said, ""Okay, well then, what do we do here?"" So, let\'s form a nontraditional partnership — fashion photographer, genetic support group — and we\'ll work together. And you can keep an eye on me to make sure that we create something positive and powerful, showing the world the beauty of albinism. And they said okay. And I was like, fantastic, let\'s do this!', '04:26': 'So in walks the first person I\'m about to photograph. Her name is Christine, and Christine is a knockout. Long white hair, really tall. She\'s stunning. She walks into my studio. The way that she walks in, though, instead of this gorgeous girl, she walks in like this, her head\'s down, shoulders hunched, one-word answers, she looks down, no eye contact. This kid has been teased her whole life because of her difference. And it was so apparent in the fact that it left her with zero self-esteem. And I\'m thinking, oh, this kid is just so fragile. And just the day before, I was shooting Cindy on the same set, in my studio. I\'m thinking well, I have to be so careful with her — no, out of respect for this gorgeous kid, I\'m going to photograph her like I would anybody else. So the fan went on, the music went on, and I grabbed a mirror that was next to the set, and I held it up to her, and I said Christine, look at yourself. You\'re magnificent. And she looked in the mirror, and she got it. And she went from this to that. And that\'s our Christine, and she just exploded in front of the set. By the time she left the studio, she was kissing everybody on both cheeks, and saying, ""Ciao!"" and she was unbelievable. And I saw this transformation right in front of the lens, through photography, that she was now transformed, with a powerful and positive sense of who she is.', '05:47': ""The next day, she goes to school, she's going to change the way her community sees her difference. Instead of walking into that classroom like this, she's walking in like this. So it's all about ambassadors for change. It was extraordinary. And those first images, right after, we did a series of them, using several individuals with this condition, they were in Life magazine in 1998. So it was a while ago. It was a cover story, it was a five-page spread. It was really a fantastic editorial. It was great; I loved it. Then we used a lot of the images, though, from Life, and put them in other magazines, magazines worldwide. Magazines in the U.K., in France, in Italy and Canada, and other magazines in the States. It was amazing."", '06:29': ""So this is from the U.K., Christine again. Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, and Kristen. That's Lauren. We did a campaign for sunglasses. A lot of kids with this condition are photophobic, so they have a real strong light sensitivity. So we thought, perfect for a sunglass campaign. People magazine did a great story. So it was circulating, people were saying all this great stuff. It was fantastic."", '06:54': ""So I was getting calls, though. Getting calls from the U.K., saying, well we just saw this spread, can you come photograph our kids with this condition? We have a support group here, can you come meet our families? People in Africa were calling in the same. New Zealand, can you help us start a support group? I'm like, fantastic! This is great! Let's do it! So I would travel in all these places, as I was shooting and doing my commercial work,"", '07:16': 'I was at a local chapter conference in Philadelphia. Small family conference, about 40 families, did my presentation of kids with albinism, this mom came up to me, and she said, ""My son Randy, when he was a little boy, he\'d come home from school, and I could see the kids were teasing him, and he\'d be in tears. And I\'d buy him an ice-cream cone, or a toy truck, and he\'d forget about it."" She said, ""Now he\'s in high school. He comes home from school, I can see the pain, the anguish in his eyes. He walks in, he walks right past me, goes up to his room, slams the door, and I don\'t see him until the next day. He\'s not going to want to be photographed, he has zero self-esteem, this kid has such poor body image, and he\'s just so shy. But if you could just show him photographs of kids his own age, so that he knows he\'s not alone."" I\'m like, ""Of course. Where is he? Show me!"" She points over to Randy. Now Randy\'s sitting there — his pants are hanging down to here, his underwear\'s hanging out, he has this long, great big shirt, he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo. He\'s amazing, this kid. I crawl over to Randy. I\'m like, ""Randy, I speak to moms and dads every single day, terrified about the future of their kids with albinism. All they have to do is take one look at you, and they\'re going to be fine. Please let me take a photo of you. Your mother said, she told me, that you didn\'t want to be photographed."" He said, ""Rick, what do you mean? You have to understand, I\'m 16 years old. I don\'t talk to my mother."" And then he said, ""I want to be photographed. I want to show the world that who I am, with my albinism, but also other things about me —"" You see how shy he was. Very, very shy, Randy. But Randy created, early days in this idea, of this nonprofit group Positive Exposure, the idea of networking stories, sharing experiences and the images around the world.', '08:55': ""I'll kind of quickly go through the album. I was very interested, at that point, getting calls from everybody in the world, to find out more about this idea, a message, about albinism, or perceptions of people in communities about this syndrome, albinism. So I started hearing about stigmas, and discrimination, so what I looked at is really trying to explore cultural perceptions and attitudes towards this condition. This is my friend [unclear], who's a Kuna Indian in the San Blas region of the world, the San Blas region of Panama. She's extraordinary. So the incidence of albinism is about one in 20,000 worldwide. In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, the highest incidence in the world. We went to Fiji, actually, where we found out at the turn of the 19th century, a tribe could not hold their territory unless they had somebody with albinism in a powerful political position. My great friend Keke, I photographed in New Zealand, she's from India, from Delhi, but her family left Delhi because she was getting death threats. Now I'm thinking, this is horrible that they had to move, because she's eight years old. And we actually started a support group in Delhi, we found out that there are many kids that we worked with in their communities, after we started this group in India, that have had really positive experiences."", '10:09': ""So one of the things we want to make very clear is that we're not making generalizations about a community or a culture, and their reaction to people that are different. Keke's experiences were very different, but we've met many kids there that have been embraced by their communities throughout India. A great friend Sue Anna from Korea. Tom, who was just adopted by an American family, from China, This is my great friend Harry from Puerto Rico. And Natalia. She and I started the first albinism society in Russia. Maizan and her sister and mom in Malaysia. Ceara. All she ever wanted to do was be a dancer. She was told that because of her visual impairment, she'll never dance. She'll never be able to follow the choreography or the dance steps. She's like, they said, find another love, another passion. She's like, no. She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion, and just started a school for dance for kids with visual impairment. I'm going to zip through this. Roz, from Australia. I spend a lot of time in Africa, where there's a high incidence of mortality associated with albinism, due to skin cancer. This is my friend Siri, who when she was born, the father's family put her out of the house, thinking she was cursed. and Mom, not knowing what to do, put Siri in the sun to get her dark like her brothers and sisters. So you can see, it's all sun damage. A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa were put in special schools, schools for the blind, not because the tools were better there for kids with visual impairment, but more importantly, because the teasing was so great, the discrimination is so great, these kids don't do well in mainstream schools."", '11:45': 'I started an albinism society in Kenya with my friend C.K., who actually went to a mainstream school. I\'m like, C.K., how is it possible you went to a mainstream school? Nobody in Africa goes to mainstream schools. She said, ""It\'s because of my twin sister, Delphine."" Fantastic. She said Delphine would get all the work off the board, the things I couldn\'t see, she\'d help me with it. If the type was too small, she\'d blow it up for me, she said. But more importantly, when kids would tease me, Delphine would beat them up. (Laughter)', '12:12': ""But on a sadder note, I was spending a lot of time in Tanzania, where witch doctors are saying, bring me the bones of an albino, and I'll make a potion that will make you rich. So we're working very closely with the government there, I've been there six times in the last two years, to create public awareness programs to save these kids. This is the dancer. This is in the Shinyanga region. This is one of the visuals that we created in East Africa, trying to fight and educate the public."", '12:41': ""I received the Art of Reporting award, from an organization called the Chromosome 18 Registry. The larger organization was the Genetic Alliance, which was a coalition of all the genetic support groups, and it was the award for the Life magazine piece. The president at the time said, I'm also the founder and director of the Chromosome 18 Research Society and Registry. I'm like, fantastic! That's great. What's that? She's like, well, if you have an anomaly on your 18th chromosome, then you have all kinds of problems and difficulties and challenges, and then we look after you, through this support group, like NOAH is. So I'm like, that's great. She said, I see there's a universal message here, about all kids with differences, so it's not just about albinism. Would you come and speak to our families in San Antonio with these chromosome 18 anomalies? I'm like, sure! I went back to them thinking, what the hell is a chromosome 18 anomaly? I was an art major at the school of visual arts, I had no idea. But I looked it up, these are the images that I saw. I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, this is going to be rough."", '13:37': ""But I went to San Antonio, walked down to the auditorium where the kids and young adults were, opened the door, and I was instantly surrounded by kids screaming with laughter. There were kids with cleft palates, kids with mobility issues, feeding tubes, trachs, but they were kids, first and foremost. That's Rebecca and Pauline. My great friend, that's Ellington. He's awesome. Remy. That's Emory. Byron. Taylor. Elizabeth. And my great friend Sean."", '14:08': 'So we decided at that point to involve other organizations to be part of this larger exhibition that was going to be sent out from the People\'s Genome Celebration in 2001. The National Human Genome Research Institute and the Genetic Alliance invited me to create an exhibition at the Smithsonian, commemorating the mapping of the human genome. So we actually invited other genetic support groups to be part of this exhibition, not just on albinism, but all groups, again illustrating the universal applicability. I saw these images from the Marfan Foundation, these kids grow very, very tall, at risk of an aortic dissection, but they\'re amazing kids, and I thought, how gorgeous. And I understood the importance of this image, how important it was to show how beautiful, and to show how the image presents itself. But isn\'t there another way to show it? Because nobody, and I\'ve photographed thousands of kids now, with Marfan Syndrome, and nobody stands like this, with a portable black bar. It\'s extraordinary. So we decided to put them in a pool, show Billy swimming -- [""Bill with Marfan Syndrome""] -- show how it presents itself, but keep going, and keep presenting how these kids look, but put the humanity back in these gorgeous images. I only have a few seconds here, so I\'m going to go through. Cool girls at the Costello Conference. These are great friends Danielle and Maggie, who actually met at the last Costello Conference. For both, the first time they ever met anybody with the same syndrome. They go to the same conferences every year and I go and photograph them. And this year, they were there again in Florida, but this time it\'s a little different. They\'re gangsters now. (Laughter) But they\'re pretty amazing kids. I just want to talk very briefly about this really great kid, to talk very briefly about a project that we\'re taking these images, and bringing them into high schools.', '15:47': ""I can photograph a great kid in my studio, and she's having a brilliant time, and she feels 10,000 feet tall. By the time she leaves my studio and gets to Park Avenue, five people point at her, point at her birthmark, or at her white hair, or her wheelchair. So we have to make it relevant for all of us, for all these kids, to make people understand what the idea of celebrating diversity actually means. So we started a project called the PEARLS Project, where these photographs are going into high schools, and the kids that are in the images are blogging, and the students are following their blogs. And they all have these great video intros. I just want to give you this last one, and this is actually Byron, who is actually one of our bloggers. (Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron. I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14. When I was 10 months old, I had a left hemispherectomy. I had the left half of my brain removed, because I have something called Sturge-Weber Syndrome. I wear a brace on my right leg and right arm. I only see out of the right side of each eye, so sometimes it's harder for me to see things on the right side. So playing sports can be frustrating, because I might not see a ball coming. I didn't see that coming. Excuse me."", '17:14': ""Rick Guidotti: So we're using all the visual art to change public perceptions through these great kids. I feel as an artist, it's my responsibility. I know that when I was a kid, and I saw someone that was different walking down the street, If I stared, I got slapped by my mom. So the idea was if you don't stare, look away. And I think as an artist, it's my responsibility, and all of our responsibilities, to steady that gaze a little bit longer. Because you stand there, and you'll see a difference. You'll start seeing beauty in that difference. And you'll start seeing beautiful gorgeousness, and then this light just spreads, and once you're enlightened, it just changes your whole world. It's about seeing the beauty in all differences. Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over. Thank you guys, thank you.""}"

These highly evolved beings want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes can diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish?', '00:39': 'Questions like this haunt Octavia Butler’s ""Dawn,"" the first in her trilogy ""Lilith’s Brood."" A visionary storyteller who upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep us awake at night.', '00:54': 'Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction film called ""Devil Girl From Mars."" Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story.', '01:17': 'Much science fiction features white male heroes who blast aliens or become saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the representation of their experiences.', '01:32': 'For Butler, imagination was not only for planting the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate them in new contexts.', '01:53': 'One of her most beloved novels, the ""Parable of the Sower,"" follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an ever-changing world.', '02:29': 'Lauren’s quest had roots in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated contemporary news into her writing.

I have absolutely no background in biology, chemistry or engineering, so bear with me, because I'll be talking about biomedical engineering today."", '00:24': '(Laughter)', '00:25': 'And please do stay here in the meantime.', '00:30': ""Industrial design is about making lots of things identical. The downside about that is, there's something impersonal about lots of identical things, because when you're trying to design one thing for one person to solve one issue, you can't really do that when you're making things aimed more to a demographic model or to a marketing requirements document, which is what we live by. So I got disheartened by the whole process in general, and went to rethink it and redesign designing altogether, went way back to my early, early design inspirations, and back to about eight years old, and that got me to this guy. Anyone here from MIT knows him or has a tattoo or poster of him somewhere."", '01:09': '(Laughter)', '01:10': 'Anyone else in the room, just for a hint, he is the engineer of engineers or the designer of designers. He is the guy who made bionics a household word in the form of the polyester-clad Six Million Dollar Man that I grew up with.', '01:25': ""The thing that came from this pop culture show, the real takeaway, was two main things: if you're designing for the person, for a real person, you don't settle for the minimum functional requirements; you see how far beyond that you can go, where the rewards really are way out in the fringe of how far past that document you can go. And if you can nail that, you stand to improve the quality of life for somebody for every moment for the rest of their life. I kind of distilled that down into a design philosophy, and infuse that into the studio that I have now; I'm trying to get everyone to think along these lines. It's not a profound philosophy, but it works for us."", '02:06': ""We work with prosthetic limbs, and the first thing you see about prosthetic limbs is that they are engineering brilliance. They can do amazing things; they can return all kinds of functionality and performance back to somebody's life. But from the vantage of an industrial designer, they're not quite there. What we don't see is the sculpture or the beauty or the individual qualities or the uniqueness or the elegance to them. They are brilliant, mechanical, utilitarian devices. And that's great, except for a lot of people, that doesn't work. People come to our studio all the time, and they have bubble wrap and duct tape, trying to approximate their original form. Or they'll have a gym sock stuffed with other gym socks to try to recreate the shape that once was; and that, to us, is not thriving."", '02:54': ""The body, to us, is not a mechanical entity, where mechanical-only solutions can address them. It's our personal sculpture, our kinematic sculpture. It is our canvas; it represents not just our physicality, but also a lot of our personality as well. So when you're designing for the body, maybe the thing isn't to design for mass production, but to design with the body in mind, to really think about curves instead of hard geometry, or uniqueness instead of identical. The problem is, we're constrained by mass production, which makes a million identical things but can't make one unique, individualized thing. So we scrapped that in the new design process, and we start with the person."", '03:33': 'This is a three-dimensional scanner, and that\'s what happens when you scan somebody: you get three-dimensional data into your computer. You can take the sound-side limb there, the surviving limb, mirror it over, and from now on, anything in the process will recreate symmetry -- something as personal and as hard to achieve as symmetry in the body. And you create a product that, no matter what, it\'s going to be as unique as their fingerprint. In fact, our process is incapable of creating two identical things. So we run it through computer modeling, 3D CAD. Here, we actually infuse a lot of the individual\'s taste and personality into it, everywhere we can, and we three-dimensionally print the results. We call the resulting parts ""fairings,"" because they\'re named after the panels on a motorcycle that turn it from a mechanical thing into a sculptural thing.', '04:21': ""We tried this on Chad. Chad is a competitive soccer player, lost his leg eight years ago to cancer. You can imagine, it's really tricky to play soccer when you have titanium pipe where there used to be a leg. The resulting parts recreated his shape and deliberately had an aesthetic that look like sporting gear. We wanted it to make it look like he just pulled it out of the gym bag, so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard. Two things happened. One, we expected: his sense of his body came back to him. He was suddenly able to control the ball, to feel the ball, because his body remembered that original shape that he had had up until eight years ago. The other thing, though, is that the other members of the team stopped thinking of him as the amputee on the team. Not that they didn't know, but it stopped becoming a focal point for him. And there is a certain very quiet value in that, we like to believe."", '05:15': ""James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash. And the motorcycle is still a big part of James's personality and style. Check out the tattoo on his forearm. We three-dimensionally printed that into what would be his calf. He has his tattoo, he has his morphology and he has the materials of his motorcycle. And the result is interesting in that you can't really tell at first glance where the motorcycle stops and where James starts. It's kind of a chimera hybrid between the two, and James likes that."", '05:45': '(Laughter)', '05:48': 'So, we don\'t ever try to make something look like it could be human. Our whole goal is to be unapologetically man-made, to take what\'s already there, morphology, and just make it really cool and beautiful, something that somebody can\'t wait to show the world, because that changes their look. You don\'t look at him and say, ""He\'s an amputee with a prosthetic."" You say, ""He\'s a guy with something really cool going on.', '06:10': ""Deborah wanted her curves back, but she also just wanted what came out of it to be really sexy, which is great for us to hear. We created this lace pattern that lends itself well to 3D printing. We created the first leg, I think, where the lace defines the contour of the leg, instead of the leg giving form to the lace. We switched things over. What I like about this shot is you can see daylight through it. So we're not trying to hide anything; the load-bearing carbon component is totally visible. We're just giving it form and shape and contours that were hers to begin with. We made her another leg that matched her purse, just because we could."", '06:51': '(Laughter)', '06:55': '(Applause)', '07:00': ""We made another one where we laser-tattooed the leather, because how cool would it be to be able to change your tattoos out from one minute to the next? Love that. We try to capture as much of somebody's personality as we can."", '07:12': ""This is George. His will be finished next week. This is the raw computer data that we deal with. He's kind of a classic, timeless-type personality, so we did herringbone tweed, but in polished nickel."", '07:26': '(Laughter)', '07:27': ""And Uve was all too proud to show his tattoos, so we are laser-tattooing those into the leather. Part of it is, yes, we're showing off, because we can do this, but the other part is this connects him to what will be a part of him. That is something really valuable; we believe in that. Tattoos are especially exciting for us. What happens if you take the tattoo, which is a combination of somebody's personal taste and choice, and their morphology, but now, let's say, you remove the person. You get a free-floating tattoo defining their body. So everything we do is about recreating and expressing something that means something to that person, and expressing that through what would be their body, whether it's speed or attitude or bling, whatever it is that captures and suggests them in the best way we can."", '08:15': ""Back to the 3D-printing thing and this whole process: we have a process that lends itself to making one thing per person; it's very individual, and it actually really lends itself well to complexity. So why not just print the entire leg? That's the concept that preceded the work we're doing now. This is a three-dimensionally printed leg. It's symmetric to the other leg. It is made in America, it is a trivially low-carbon footprint to create, curbside recyclable, costs about 4,000 dollars to create, and it is dishwasher-safe."", '08:48': '(Laughter)', '08:50': 'There\'s a value to that, too. People don\'t think about that all the time, but yes, throw it in the dishwasher, it works just great. This was based on the original idea that I could go anywhere in the world with nothing more than a camera and a laptop computer, use the camera as a 3D scanner and create for somebody, in a matter of hours, a very high-quality, three-dimensionally printed leg for a very low cost. The proof of concept works great, we\'re finding it; we\'ll get there. Or, we upped the quality of the materials and created this for John. The fun thing with John\'s leg is that when his fiancee looked at this, she joked and said, ""I like that leg better than that leg.""', '09:27': '(Laughter)', '09:29': 'And it\'s a joke -- she knows full well what he goes through -- but at the same time, there\'s something very valuable. He turned to us and said, ""Nobody says that."" He\'s never heard that in his life. That connected with him very deeply.', '09:41': ""So we like to think that this is a new type of design, where you're turning the original process on its head, where there is a dialogue that forms between the designer and the end user, where the designer relinquishes some of the control -- designers hate doing that -- and instead, is the curator of a process. And the end user relinquishes their body into the process, and their taste. I'd like to think that speaks to a greater change that's happening in the design world altogether; in this case, it's one where products will be evaluated on how well they address the individual. The individual will actually be part of the DNA of the end product itself. We will be evaluating products on how well they address a unique person, instead of a demographic model."", '10:28': 'This all really hit home for us in one of the first legs we did; when Chad here put on the leg, reached down and felt it and thought about it for a while. Then he turned to us and said, ""That\'s the first time I\'ve felt that shape in eight years."" We thought about that. And for all the technology and all the nights and energy we put into it, that\'s all we really wanted to hear.', '10:52': 'Thanks.', '10:53': '(Applause)'}"

That day,  nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination, segregation, violence, and economic exclusion black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin.', '00:36': 'Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated facilities from within.', '00:55': 'Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the methods, groups, and people who could help further messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States  armed with strategies for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience.', '01:28': 'He began to work with Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts almost a decade before.', '01:54': 'His largest-scale organizing project came in 1963, when he led the planning for the national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, because of his homosexuality.', '02:25': ""Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus, and on the day of the march he delivered the marchers' demands in a speech directed at President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly, without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices."", '02:52': 'In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his former communist affiliation. But ultimately,  both his belief in collaboration with the government and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible.', '03:22': 'Rustin was passed over for several influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay, and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s “march towards true equality, no matter who we are or who we love.”'}"

How can we scale this critical work across the entire United States? Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of Partners in Health, discusses how her team is working with public health agencies to ramp up contact tracing for the country's most vulnerable communities -- and shows why it will take a compassionate approach to be truly effective. (This ambitious plan is part of The Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change. The conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded May 27, 2020.)",00:15:09,15.15,196091,2020-06-02T19:49:12+00:00,"['public health', 'coronavirus', 'health care', 'pandemic', 'health', 'disease', 'inequality', 'community', 'Audacious Project']","['English', 'Português brasileiro', 'العربية', '中文 (繁體)']",Joia Mukherjee,"Chief Medical Officer, Partners in Health","{'00:06': 'Chris Anderson: Joia, both you and Partners In Health have spent decades in various battlegrounds, battling epidemics. Perhaps, for context, you could give us a couple examples of that work.', '00:20': ""Joia Mukherjee: Yeah, so Partners In Health is a global nonprofit that is more than 30 years old. We started famously in Haiti in a squatter settlement, people who were displaced. And when we talked to them, they wanted health care and education, houses, jobs. And that has informed our work, that proximity to people who are suffering. When you think about health care and the poor, there is always disproportionate suffering for people who have been historically marginalized, like our communities that we serve in Haiti. And so we've always tried to provide health care for the poorest people on earth. And we were launched into an international dialogue about whether that was possible for drug-resistant tuberculosis, for HIV. Indeed, for surgery, for cancer, for mental health, for noncommunicable diseases. And we believe it's possible, and it is part of the basic human right to care. So when COVID started, we saw this immediately as a threat to the health of people who were the poorest. And Partners In Health now works in 11 countries, five on the African continent, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the former Soviet Union. And we immediately prepared to scale up testing, contact tracing, treatment, care, and then saw that it wasn't being done in the United States in that way. And in fact, we were just sitting, passively waiting for people to get sick and treat them in hospital. And that message got to the governor of Massachusetts, and we started supporting the state to do contact tracing for COVID, with the very idea that this would help us identify and resource the communities that were most vulnerable."", '02:17': ""CA: So it's really quite ironic that these decades of experience in the developing world and elsewhere, that that has now really been seen as a crucial need to bring to the US. And especially to bring your expertise around contact tracing. So, talk a bit about contact tracing, why does it matter so much, and what would, I don't know, a perfect contact tracing setup look like?"", '02:44': 'JM: Well, first I want to say that you want to, always, in any type of illness, you want to do prevention, and diagnosis and treatment and care. That is what comprehensive approaches look like, and that ""care"" piece, to us, is about the provision of social support and material support to allow people to get the care they need. So that might be transportation, it might be food. So when you look at that comprehensive approach, for an infectious disease, part of prevention is knowing where the disease is spreading and how it\'s spreading and in whom it\'s spreading, so that resources can be disproportionately put to the highest-risk areas. So contact tracing is a staple of public health and what it means is that every time a new person is diagnosed with COVID or any infectious disease, then you investigate and innumerate the people they\'ve been in contacts with, and call those contacts and say, ""You\'ve been exposed,"" or talk to them, ""You\'ve been exposed, these are the things you need to know. First of all, how are you? Do you need care yourself?"" And facilitating that. ""Second of all, these are the information you need to know to keep yourself safe. About quarantine, about prevention."" And again, this would be with any infectious disease, from Ebola, to cholera, to a sexually transmitted disease like HIV. And then we say, ""OK, knowing what you know, do you have the means to protect yourself?"" Because often the most vulnerable do not have the means to protect themselves. So that is also where this resource component comes in and where equity is so critical to making this disease stop and also getting the information and the resources to people who need them the most.', '04:49': ""CA: And in a pandemic, the people who need them the most, the most vulnerable, as you say, are probably also -- That's where the disease is spreading a lot. It's in everyone's interest to do this. You're not just making this sort of, wonderful, equity moral point that we've got to help these people. It's actually in all of our interest, right?"", '05:08': ""JM: Yes. Yes, we are one humanity, and any disease, any infectious disease that is spreading is a threat to all of us. And that is one of the pieces, there's the moral imperative, there is the epidemiologic imperative, that if you can't control these diseases everywhere, that it's a threat anywhere. And so as we look to the kind of society we want to live in, good health is something that gives us all so much return on our investment."", '05:43': ""CA: Now, some countries were able to use contact tracing almost to shut down the pandemic before it took off in that country. The US was unable to do that, and some people have taken the view that therefore, contact tracing became irrelevant, that the strategy was mitigation, shut everything down. You've argued against that, that even in a process of lockdown that actually contact tracing plays a key role. Help us understand the scale, when there's a lot of cases, the scale of tracing, both cases and everyone they may have been in contact with and their contacts. It quickly gets to a huge problem."", '06:23': ""JM: It's massive."", '06:24': 'CA: What sort of workforce do you need to make a difference at this moment, where the US is at?', '06:32': 'JM: It\'s massive. I mean, the scale is massive, and we should not take that lightly. And we don\'t, at Partners In Health. I mean, we are willing to try to figure this out, and I always feel that if we could stop Ebola in some of the poorest countries in the world, of course we ought to do it here, and was it too late when there were 28,000 deaths in Ebola? Sure, it\'s always too late. We should have started earlier, but it\'s not too late to have an impact. And so there\'s three aspects of timing and scale. First is, the earlier you start, the better, right? And that\'s what we saw in Rwanda. They went from early testing and contact tracing, the first two cases entered into the country on March 15, and in one month, because of contact tracing, isolation and plenty of testing, they had held that case rate to 134 people. It\'s remarkable, it\'s remarkable. In the state of Georgia, where is home to the CDC, similar population size, about 12 million, from the first two cases in the first month, those cases became 4,400 cases. And in the country of Belgium, a similar population, those two cases became 7,400. So you do have to make scale to stop this. But the earlier you do it, the more benefits there are to your society and also to the other people who need medical services -- women who are pregnant, people who need their fracture repaired, because services themselves in the United States have been, you know, really hampered by this huge amount of COVID. So the first point is, it\'s always late, but it\'s never too late. Why? Because vulnerable populations are sitting ducks, and so imagine if one of your contacts was a nursing assistant who worked in a nursing home. We know that one nursing assistant can spread it throughout a nursing home. And is it important to identify that person as a contact and assure that he or she is able to remain quarantined? That is critical. And so it\'s hard to say, ""Well, it\'s not worth it if it\'s just one person, two persons."" Every life matters, and all of their contacts in the community of that person matters as well. So that\'s one thing. The second about scale is people need jobs right now. And they want to be part of a solution, and some of the frustration we see, the antilockdown movement, is really out of anger and frustration and feeling, ""What can we do?"" And so this gives people this feeling that they\'re part of a solution and can provide thousands of jobs. And then third, I would say, for us to reopen our schools, our churches, our workplaces, we have to know where the virus is spreading so that we don\'t just continue on this path. And so contact tracing provides the platform to control, but also to see outbreaks in real time popping up, and then respond promptly. So there are many reasons that we have to bring this to scale now. Even though it is tardy.', '09:57': ""CA: So especially as we have this pressure to go back to work, like, contact tracing has to be part of that strategy, or we're just inviting another disaster in a few weeks' time. Whatever you make of what's happened during this mitigation process."", '10:12': ""JM: Exactly, exactly. Exactly, and so that's such an important part, Chris, and something that we are just really keen to look at the United States in a different way. What are the long-term public health infrastructures that we need to protect us for the second wave, the third wave and in the future, for future pandemics?"", '10:36': 'CA: Whitney.', '10:38': ""Whitney Pennington Rodgers: You know, to that point, there is a question out there from one of our anonymous community members, about why contact tracing isn't already part of our public health system. It seems like it does make a lot of sense its a way to mitigate the spread of disease. Could you speak a little bit to that?"", '10:55': ""JM: I think many people have said -- and I am not a politician -- that our American health care infrastructure is built on treatment and not prevention. It's built on procedures and not keeping people well. And some of that was driven by profit, and some of that was driven by need, but I think we need to rethink how we deliver care in this environment."", '11:27': 'WPR: ""There is some fear and suspicion about privacy and contact tracing. How can we build trust in the process?""', '11:33': ""JM: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think there's fear about privacy and part of it comes from the idea of what contact tracing is. And I think that's why we feel strongly, is if you lead with the idea that it's care and it's trying to get resources and information and help to people, it seems very different than just, oh, who's sick, and who's a threat. And so fundamentally -- and that's why we're so pleased to be at this TED talk today -- is it's about communication, right? It's not about surveillance, it's about communication and care and support. That's one thing. And we'll be hearing from our colleagues on the tech side. There's ways to add tech, even to care, that it can be a resource for caring and communication. But there are ways to protect people's privacy and also to provide care, and public health has many laws attached to it. This is all done within the constructs of our state public health laws. And so I think some of the communication around this is, how do we take care of each other, how do we take care of the most vulnerable. And if we frame contact tracing as care, I think that starts a different kind of conversation."", '13:01': 'CA: Mm. So, Joia, can you just talk in a bit more detail about what it is that you are advising Massachusetts to do in terms of contact tracing. Give us a sense of the scale of it.', '13:14': 'JM: Yeah, so the scale -- thank you. You know, we are able now to make about 10,000 calls a day to contacts. So every new case that comes in, the case is investigated by someone on the phone, and then those investigations means writing down the names and the phone numbers of the persons you\'ve been in contact with for the time you were sick and a couple days before. And with those numbers then, the contact tracers -- And that\'s what we really redoubled the workforce and really expanded, more than doubled, to support the department of public health to do that contact tracing. So we have 1,700 people employed full time, with benefits, to call those contacts and say, ""Are you OK? This is the information you need,"" and then, and I think this is the critical piece, when someone doesn\'t have the information, then we have another cadre of people we call the resource care coordinators, who help that person, that contact, to do the things they need to do to protect themselves. It might be food delivery, it might be filing for unemployment benefits, it might be trying to get them medical care or a test. That piece is the care piece. And that is what turns social distancing from very regressive -- look at me in my beautiful house, social distancing -- to something that\'s progressive and paying attention to those who need the resources.

In this talk, TED Fellow Michelle Borkin shows why collaboration between doctors and astronomers can lead to surprising discoveries.",00:09:33,9.55,192338,2012-01-08T14:54:03+00:00,"['TEDx', 'astronomy', 'collaboration', 'medicine', 'science', 'technology', 'medical imaging', 'space', 'medical research', 'visualizations']",['English'],Michelle Borkin,Physicist,"{'00:09': ""I believe that we can both unravel the mysteries of the universe and save human lives at the same time through interdisciplinary research. And I'm going to share with you today just one story, my story, that has crossed these paths."", '00:28': 'We start the in supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. It\'s one of the youngest ones in our galaxy, about 330 years old. An astronomy colleague approached me one day, and she had over eight years of magnificent data, just trying to understand the 3-D structure of this nebula, the supernova remnant. But she had no way to look at it. So I looked at the data with her and said, ""I think I can help you."" And although -- and this is all real data you\'re seeing on the screen above me -- this is the Hollywood rendering version, but the rough draft I made with her looks something more like this. And she was able to make novel discoveries about how supernovas explode and how shells explode within it, using a piece of software developed at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital here in Boston, called 3D Slicer. It was originally developed for looking at patients\' brain scans, doing surgical planning and doing 3-D renderings of anatomy. Who knew our solution was lurking just across the river?', '01:30': 'Now, people don\'t believe me when I tell them that astronomy and medical imaging -- these two seemingly different fields -- are really similar. So we\'re going to play a little game I like to call ""Which is which?"" I play this with new doctors and astronomers I work with. I\'m going to show you two images on the screen. One of them is biomedical and one of them is astronomical, and you have to pick them correctly in your head. So here is the first set. And again, one of these is biomedical and one is astronomical. I\'ll give you a second to make your little vote mentally. So it turns out the one on the left is some of the raw data of the supernova remnant we were just looking at, and on the right, we have an angiogram of a patient\'s heart and coronary arteries.', '02:16': ""OK, we're going to try another one. Now, this one is much closer to my daily bread and butter. Tell me which is which. And one of these is literally millimeters across, and the other is billions of miles. So, it turns out the one on the left is a confocal microscopy image of a human cornea, and on the right, we have a radio telescope image of the star-forming region NGC-1333. Now, aside from the fact that these images look similar and that doctors trying to find a tumor in a patient's brain or a young star forming is similar, the way the data comes from the machine or the telescope is remarkably similar."", '02:57': ""Here's an MRI scanner. And if you've never seen the raw data of a patient's brain, this is what it looks like. When the MRI scanner is acquiring the data, it goes in slices. So you can see the patient's nose, their eyes; it kind of progresses towards the middle of the head; you can start to see the cortex, and it steps through to the back of the brain. Now, believe it or not, telescopes, and particularly radio telescopes, operate in a similar manner. If we were to look at the raw data from these telescopes ... We're going to look at a nebula called M16. We start with this radio telescope at the front of the nebula, stepping back towards the middle of the nebula, just like the middle of the patient's brain -- those bright regions are where young stars are forming -- all the way to the back of the nebula, just like the back of the patient's head. Now, although the doctors are able to then take this data and look at it in 3-D and do surgical planning, this is cutting-edge, just about as good as you get with any astronomer, and this is what they have to look at to understand the 3-D structure and velocity's momentum in our universe. But we can do better."", '04:07': ""So, you might recognize this nebula more like this: the famous Hubble image of the Pillars of Creation or the Eagle Nebula. And, I'm going to fade this out onto a radio image, it's a false color in the background, and fade away the Hubble image you're used to. But we don't need to just look at this in 3-D, we can look at it in 2-D, and here I'm using a radiology tool kit called OsiriX."", '04:31': ""When I showed this to astronomer Marc Pound, whose data this is, he was amazed, because he had been trying so hard to study the impact of a young group of stars. And he had this theory that there's this wind crashing and tossing the pillars over, and it took him months to prove this with conventional visualization. But in one shot, you can see the shock wave of wind blasting through across to the left-hand side of the screen. Now, I don't think myself or any of my collaborators would've anticipated how far this has gone, and by sharing the medical technology with astronomy and astronomy with medical, we've been able to find new stars and supernova remnants, and revolutionize how you do heart diagnostics and look at data for different patients and organize it and data-mine it."", '05:17': ""I don't have time to show you all these great projects, but I'll show you one of them. This is a collaboration I've been working on, called The Multiscale Hemodynamics Project. I'm working with doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Now, what this represents is a novel way of doing heart disease diagnostics. And instead of the conventional invasive angiography, this is just a CT scan. What you see here are the coronary arteries. So you have your heart, and the arteries wrap around the outside. These are the arteries you worry about getting blocked and giving you a heart attack and killing you. So it's really important that we look at them."", '05:52': ""Now, this is a CT scan of a patient with a blood-flow simulation -- that's the coloring up there. That simulation was originally developed for studying the structure of DNA, and then the visualization was done with a tool kit called VisIt, originally developed for physics simulations. Interdisciplinary. My assignment was to try and come up with a new way of looking at this to make it optimal for the doctors and hospital: How can we make it the most efficient for them for a diagnosis?"", '06:22': 'And I came up with this image. It\'s 2-D; I took the whole artery and collapsed everything into a 2-D plane. I got some very quizzical looks when I showed this to the doctors originally. But I was inspired to do this representation from my astronomy work, where we\'ve been using these tree diagrams along the bottom to understand the structure of nebulae. Well, we were inspired in that work from the bioinformatics and genome community, where they use these tree diagrams to understand their gene expression data. They were inspired by the evolutionary biologists, who use these tree diagrams to understand how species evolve and are related, the first of which was drawn by Sir Charles Darwin. Here\'s an example from his ""Origin of the Species."" So, straight from Darwin, through biology, physics, astronomy, back to medical imaging. Interdisciplinary. One may say, ""Well, is this 2-D representation better?"" I did a study at Harvard Medical School to answer just that question.', '07:19': 'And it turns out, if you present the image on the left to a doctor, on average, they find about 39% of the high-risk regions that could explode or block your heart and kill you. On the right, we can do a little better, and they\'re able to find 62% of these high-risk, dangerous regions. But we can do even better, simply by changing the colors. The rainbow color map is a sin most doctors and astronomers and physicists are guilty of using. (Laughs) And it doesn\'t focus the best qualities of your visual system. The human system can see brightness variation, contrast ... not really good at that whole ""green-yellow-blue"" thing.', '08:01': 'But now, if you look in the shades of red and highlight the regions that are most diseased with dark red, now doctors can find 91% of the high-risk regions, simply by changing the colors.', '08:12': '(Applause)', '08:15': 'And I would have never known the importance of color if it was not for my computer science and visualization collaborators showing this to me. So again: interdisciplinary collaboration.', '08:25': ""How do you even get a collaboration like this? In the case of astronomical medicine, it started with a Harvard Astronomy professor, Alyssa Goodman, serendipitously meeting a computer scientist and imaging specialist from Brigham and Woman’s Hospital, and their recruitment of a very adventurous, open-minded, young student. (Laughter) And from there, it has exploded: we've pulled in cardiologists and computer scientists and radiologists and astronomers, physicists, chemists, computational physicists -- I mean, we've brought so many people together. And it's been enlightening to share domains and information across borders. And we're still going. And although most of the people up on the screen are from Harvard or Harvard Med, now we cross different institutions and continents to work together."", '09:11': ""All I can say is, it has just been wonderful. We're continuing to make new discoveries. And I just urge you: attend conferences not in your own domain, read books and journals not in your own discipline, watch TED talks and come to events like this and say hi to the neighbor sitting next to you, because you really never know where your next great idea is going to come from."", '09:33': 'Thank you.', '09:35': '(Applause)'}"

""There's just us.""",,,191471,2019-02-15T22:52:20+00:00,"['politics', 'Africa', 'global issues', 'state-building', 'immigration', 'youth']",['English'],Lindiwe Mazibuko,,"{'0:00': 'So, I\'m here to recruit you. (Laughter) But not in the sense that you\'re thinking. I know I\'m a politician. I\'ll save that for another day. I\'m here to try and encourage you to take up a leadership role in public service in your country and on your continent. I\'m here to convince you that your country and your continent need you - not later, not when you\'re older and more experienced, but now - and that whether you realize it or not, your country\'s politics are going to be doomed to fail unless you\'re willing to get involved right now. So my recruitment pitch comes with a single disclaimer: I resigned from public office 18 months ago. (Laughter) I did it in order to take stock of my time in office, to think about the work that I had done, to capacitate myself with skills, knowledge, contacts, allies and experiences, and to find a little bit of personal and professional perspective. It\'s one of the best decisions I think I\'ve ever made. I imagine that some time during the next 18 minutes while I\'m pitching you, you\'re going to think, ""Yeah, it\'s easy for you to say I should go into public service. You\'ve already done it and you\'ve left."" But I hope I\'ll be able to convince you that, in fact, we all find ourselves in exactly the same boat right now. Because being outside of politics for 18 months has reminded me just how important it is and just how much the political landscapes in my country and in your countries and on our continent are truly lacking in good leadership and political talent. So, I want to make a deal with you. I\'m not going to return to active politics unless you come with me. (Laughter) I\'m not going to do it alone. I won\'t go back unless I can convince smart, entrepreneurial, highly skilled, talented, experienced young Africans like yourselves and millions more like you across the continent, that the best chance that our countries have, not just for survival but for lasting prosperity, is if our most talented citizens step forward and make themselves available, either for political party, leadership or for public service and government. So over the next 16-or-so minutes that are remaining, I\'m going to alternately flatter you, as I just have, (Laughter) I\'m going to challenge you, I\'m going to talk to you about my experiences, about a couple of facts and figures; I may even frighten you a little bit. And it\'ll be entirely worth it if that fear convinces you of the urgency of the point in history that we find ourselves in today. Everything I say today will be in service of a single objective: convincing you, showing you, that your countries need you; that Africa\'s prosperity may depend on many things - entrepreneurialism, industrial development, health reform, social upliftment - but that all of these hinge upon the success of politics and government in our countries. I can\'t begin a talk about public service, of course, without honoring my former president Nelson Mandela, the father of democratic South Africa. (Cheers) (Applause) President Mandela passed away on this day in 2013. I really believe that when the people of my country look back on the day that he passed away, it\'ll be seen as an inflection point in South Africa\'s history. The day we decided whether we could, indeed, go it alone without him. What\'s written in those history books will depend entirely on whether this generation, which includes all of you sitting in this room, recognizes that the time has come for us to take up the work that President Mandela left for us, before that work is captured by people who would use power and politics for empty vanity and personal gain. I\'m referring, of course, to the young man who was here in London this very past week. Defiling the name of the visionary leader, the intellectual and political strategist, the formidable athlete, the Prince of the Abathembu nation who served as a South Africa\'s first democratic president. The young man who tried to taint President Mandela\'s legacy with a few throwaway lines, all in service of getting cheap headlines, which he got. People like this, who we leave public service to when we stay out of the fray of public service, are the reason your country and my country needs you and needs us. So let us begin. I want to first talk to you about the African diaspora. You may have heard about a study in 2013 that revealed that cash transfers from Africans living outside of the continent have now begun to exceed donor aid from foreign countries into Africa. (Applause) In 2012, total remittances to Africa stood at 60 billion dollars while in the same year, official development aid to Sub-Saharan Africa totalled 44.6 billion by comparison. Now, this got me thinking. If we can do such great work with our money from outside of Africa, what can we do with our skills, our talent, our experiences, our education and our passion for our countries and for our continent? I\'ve spent the past semester at the Harvard Kennedy School as a fellow at the Institute of Politics. I ran a seminar which was called ""How to build a democracy? Lessons from South Africa."" It was also about Zimbabwe and Malawi.  And it wasn\'t intended to make it seem like we got everything right in South Africa, but it was asking the critical question: Now that we have this legacy of peaceful transition, of constitutionalism, of difficult negotiations, which were very, very difficultly gotten, are we going to be successful in entrenching that democracy and making it last into the future? Now, one of the benefits of being an African in an academic setting like New England is that other African students reach out to you, they want to talk to you, and many of them express to you their desire to enter public service. So I had students knocking down my door, wanting to talk to me in office hours about the fact that they have Ghanean parents but they were born in Texas. They really wanted to give back to Ghana, but they\'re afraid that if they go home, nobody will take them seriously as real Africans. I had students who said they had families, wives, children, husbands, partners to take care of, perhaps they were better off staying in the United States and providing for their families back home rather than going back and getting into public service. This got me thinking about the question of skills remittance, of talent remittance, of social and political remittance. If these young people have the passion to give back to their communities monetarily, imagine how different our politics would be if those same skills, influence, leadership, talent were put at work in service of the public good. And that includes all of you in this room because many of you are also part of the diaspora. I\'m here to recruit you. I\'m here to make a deal with you. I\'m not going back unless I take you with me. (Laugther) Now, I know that most of you, if not the vast majority of you, are completely fed up, turned off, discouraged, disgusted by politics, either in your country, in this country, all over the world. Perhaps you are discouraged by the fact that governments are slow to deliver. Perhaps they\'re inefficient.  Perhaps they are thoroughly corrupt and rotten to the core. Perhaps they\'re responsible for conflicts that have claimed lives and livelihoods in the countries from which you come. So why would you sink your time and your energies into such a compromised system? One of the most powerful analyses of conflict, inefficiency, corruption, stagnation which I\'ve encountered in recent months is the question of a political economy. There is a reason that our governments are not performing as they should. It\'s not just because of a failure within the system. Consider the political economy of conflict and corruption in your own country. Why is it so difficult to overcome? Who is making money or amassing power because things don\'t work the way they should? Where does the back stop? Who has an incentive to keep the system dysfunctional? And how can we work together to overcome their total infection of the system, to ensure that we don\'t lose our grip on the very principle of democratic governance? The answer, I\'m afraid, because you were born into this political time, is simply by taking over - you have to get involved. There\'s no way around it. You have to join political organizations in numbers large enough to influence change from within. You have to actively seek to take up a leadership role in government, in the state, in the public service and deftly but decisively move its priorities to where they should be: not in the service of people who want to amass power and money for themselves, but to better the lives of the highest number of people. There will always be government, whether we like it or not, whether we find it palatable or not. But there won\'t always be democracy. If we ignore politics, the people who have been quietly lobbying our governments to prioritize development ahead of democracy, these are the people who will have their way, and the systems that we now take for granted will dissolve before our eyes. When I was campaigning in South Africa last year for the 2014 general election, the voter registration numbers looked a little bit like this, six months before the election: 23% of potential voters in the 18-to-19-year-old age group were registered to vote. In the age group 20 to 29 years old, 55% were registered. And from 30 upwards, the number varied from 79 to 100%; in fact, there were more people aged 80 and over who were registered than were in the census numbers in South Africa. Imagine that. Fully 100% of people over a certain age consider voting to be an indispensable right, 21 years into democracy, and do not shirk their responsibility to register and turn out at the polls. But in the 18-to-19-year-old age group - and we must remember 19 is the average age on our continent; 26 is the average age in South Africa - the number is 23% to 55%. What\'s the political economy of voter apathy? Who benefits when we stay out of the system? Who gets to keep the status quo and empower themselves and enrich themselves and continue to infect our political system like a cancer. Who banks by us continuing with the status quo? Now even as I say all of this to you, that your country and your continent need you to enter public service, I know that if you take up my challenge, you\'re going to face huge amounts of resistance - all because of these political economies that I have just described. I did. I was told that I was too young. I was too female. (Laughter) I didn\'t have enough experience though no one could define what experience was enough. I had too much of a white accent; I wasn\'t a real African. I straightened my hair and wore weaves; I wasn\'t a real African. We should be honest about the things that hold people back from entering public service - humiliation, degradation; it\'s not an easy road - but all of these things should illustrate to you the extent to which the status quo is designed to enrich and empower a few at the expense of the many, and it should impart to you the urgency of you, as a generation, of now getting involved in public service to change that very culture. And if you decide to enter public service, you may even be tempted to believe some of these criticisms. They\'re designed to keep you out; that\'s how gatekeeping works. Somebody is benefiting from the absence of excellence and disruption in politics and government. But these are challenges that have to be faced on. There is no other route; there is no wishing this away. They are the reason that your country and your continent need you. We have this thing in politics in Africa; it\'s called the ""big man."" The cult of personality - we\'ve all heard different terminologies for it. In South Africa, in particular, this entails waiting for a great person to come and save us from ourselves. Currently, we\'re waiting for Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma or [inaudible] to come and save South Africa from itself, to save us from the mess that we find ourselves in that perhaps another big man put us in. But how can a single personality be held responsible for building or for running a whole nation? And where do we turn when they fail? If we haven\'t cultivated any kind of pipeline of energetic, young people who wanted to enter public service now or in the future and, critically, who can do the job better, are we doomed to always have to choose between mediocrity and ego, and mediocrity and ego? Is that it? Is that all our government will ever be? Or worse: Are we going to stand by while presidents change constitutions so they can serve a third term and a fourth term and a fifth term, claiming that three million people signed a petition stating that they are the only person who can do the job? (Laughter) (Applause) Is that what we\'ll do? Now, there\'s a new energy around entrepreneurism and innovation and growth in Africa today. But that energy isn\'t going to translate into lasting prosperity unless we get our politics right. Political leaders who are gatekeepers of the status quo will claim that any success is their success. They\'ll centralize power, and they\'ll demand that we all be grateful for those little green shoots of achievement, and then they\'ll claim that nobody else can do the job. They\'ll argue that development must come first, freedom can come later, and that they are the best benevolent dictator to do the job. They\'ll take your political voice from you when times are a little bit good, and when times go bad, they will refuse to give it back. There is no prosperity for our continent without a vibrant, diverse, and truly competitive politics, founded upon excellence, transparency and commitment to the public good. Our politics will not have any of these qualities unless talented, young people, the best people, step forward at this moment in Africa\'s history, when we\'re emerging from that stereotype of the dark continent, the hopeless continent, and commit themselves to public service. We must run for office. We must work in the civil service. We must disrupt the political status quo. We must prevent the rush to the bottom. You really are the ones that you have been waiting for. There are no great saviors waiting somewhere in the wings to save us from future problems. There\'s nobody who is waiting in the wings to come and save us from ourselves; there\'s just us. And I\'m not going back without you. (Laughter) So, will you take up the challenge? Thank you. (Cheers) (Applause)'}"

But as he embarked on yet another life running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need for political reform.', '00:41': 'Milk strongly believed that tight knit neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal approach to local government.', '01:00': 'This philosophy led him to run for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative for his own district, which included the heart of American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as political outsiders. But Milk refused to downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality.', '01:47': 'But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, the ""mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay public officials in US history.', '02:31': 'Elated, Milk arrived in office determined to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national momentum, especially in the form of California’s Proposition 6.', '02:53': 'The proposition, which sought to make it illegal for homosexuals to work in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign against hate.', '03:32': 'On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was gaining traction. But just twenty days after this inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.', '03:51': 'Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those he called ""radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk\'s murder, thousands marched by candlelight through the city.', '04:15': 'In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar throughout the city in what became known as the White Night Riots.', '04:32': 'But even after his death, Milk continued to preach his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total of three different tapes to be played in the event of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome in the fight against injustice: ""I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door…”'}"

We\'re going overseas and bringing back pictures like this: of the utterly distressed or the displaced or the hungry or the child laborers or the exotic.', '01:00': ""Now, Susan Sontag reminds us that photographs, in part, help define what we have the right to observe, but more importantly, they are an ethics of seeing. And I think right now is a good time to review our ethics of seeing, as our industries of reporting and research and NGO work are collapsing and changing, in part, by what's being driven by what's happening in the economy. But it's making us forge new relationships. And those new relationships have some fuzzy boundaries. I worked at the edge of some of these fuzzy boundaries, and I want to share with you some of my observations."", '01:36': ""My ethics of seeing is informed by 25 years as a reporter covering emerging economies and international relations. And I believe in a free and independent press. I believe that journalism is a public good. But it's getting harder to do that job, in part, because of the massive layoffs, because the budgets for international reporting aren't there anymore, new technologies and new platforms begging new content, and there are a lot of new journalisms. There's activist journalism, humanitarian journalism, peace journalism, and we are all looking to cover the important stories of our time. So we're going to NGOs and asking them if we can embed in their projects. This is in part because they're doing important work in interesting places."", '02:26': 'That\'s one example here: this is a project I worked on in the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. NGOs understand the benefits of having reporters tag along on their team. They need the publicity, they are under tremendous pressure, they\'re competing in a very crowded market for compassion. So they\'re also looking to reporters and to hire freelance reporters to help them develop their public relations material and their media material. Now, researchers are also under pressure. They\'re under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy. So they\'re collaborating with reporters, because for many researchers, it\'s difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story. And the benefit for reporters is that covering field research is some of the best work out there. You not only get to cover science, but you get to meet interesting scientists, like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling, she, of the magic research high tops there. And it was a discussion with Revi that brought us to the edge of the researcher and reporter, that fuzzy boundary. And I said to her, ""I was looking forward to going to developing countries and doing research and covering stories at the same time."" She said, ""I don\'t think so, girlfriend."" And that confusion, that mutual confusion, drove us to publish a paper on the conflicting ethics and the contradictory practices of research and reporting. We started with the understanding that researchers and reporters are distant cousins, equally storytellers and social analysts. But we don\'t see nor portray developing communities the same way.', '04:10': ""Here's a very classic example. This is Somalia, 1992. It could be Somalia today. And this is a standard operating procedure for much of the news video and the news pictures that you see, where a group of reporters will be trucked in, escorted to the site of a disaster, they'll produce their material, take their pictures, get their interviews, and then they'll be escorted out. This is decidedly not a research setting."", '04:36': ""Now, sometimes, we're working on feature stories. This is an image I took of a woman in Bhongir Village in Andhra Pradesh in India. She's at a microfinance meeting. It's a terrific story. What's important here is that she is identifiable. You can see her face. This also is not a research picture. This is much more representative of a research picture. It's a research site: you see young women accessing new technologies. It's more of a time stamp, it's a documentation of research. I couldn't use this for news. It doesn't tell enough, and it wouldn't sell."", '05:14': 'But then, the differences are even deeper than that. Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates that researchers are under. They are under some very strict rules governed by their university research review boards when it comes to content and confidentiality. Researchers are mandated to acquire document-informed consent. Well, as a reporter, if I hang a microphone on someone, that is consent. And when it comes to creating the story, I\'ll fact-check as a reporter, but I don\'t invite company to create that story, whereas social scientists, researchers, and particularly participatory researchers, will often work on constructing the narrative with the community. And when it comes to paying for information, ""checkbook journalism"" is roundly discouraged, in part, because of the bias it introduces in the kind of information you get. But social scientists understand that people\'s time is valuable so they pay them for that time.', '06:13': ""So while journalists are well-placed to convey the beauty of the scientific process -- and I would add, the NGO process -- what about the warts? What happens if a research project is not particularly well-designed, or an NGO project doesn't fulfill its goals? Or the other kind of warts, you know, what happens after dark when the drinks happen. Research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments; you make good friends while you're doing good work. But there's a little bit of Johnnie Walker journalism after dark, and what happens to that line between embedded and in-bedded? Or what do you do with the odd and odious behavior? The point is that you'll want to negotiate in advance what is on the record and off the record."", '07:06': ""I'm going to turn now to some NGO imagery which will be familiar to some of you in this audience."", '07:14': '(Video) Narrator: For about 70 cents, you can buy a can of soda, regular or diet. In Ethiopia, for just 70 cents a day, you can feed a child like Jamal nourishing meals. For about 70 cents, you can also buy a cup of coffee. In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.', '07:41': ""Leslie Dodson: Now, there's some very common imagery that's been around for 40 years. That's part of Sally Struthers's famine campaign. Some of it is very familiar; it's the Madonna and child. Women and children are very effective in terms of NGO campaigns. We've been looking at this imagery for a long time, for hundreds and hundreds of years; the Madonna and child. Here is [Duccio], and here is Michelangelo. My concern is: Are we one-noting the genders in our narratives of poverty in developing communities? Do we have women as victims, and are men only the perpetrators? Are they the guys with the AK-47s or the boy soldiers? Because that doesn't leave room for stories like the man who's selling ice cream at the refuge camp in Southern Sudan, where we did a project, or the stories of the men who are working on the bridge over the Blue Nile. So I wonder: Are these stories inconvenient to our narratives?"", '08:44': ""And what about this narrative? This is a for-profit game, and its aim is to make development fun. One question is: Did they inadvertently make fun of? Another set of questions is: What are the rights of these children? What rights of publicity or privacy do they have? Did they get paid? Should they get paid? Should they share in the profit? This is a for-profit game. Did they sign talent waivers? I have to use these when I'm working with NGOs and documentary filmmakers here in the States. In the States, we take our right to privacy and publicity very seriously. So what is it about getting on a long-haul flight that makes these rights vaporize?"", '09:31': ""I don't want to just pick on our friends in the gaming arts; I'll turn to the graphic arts, where we often see these monolithic, homogeneous stories about the great country of Africa. But Africa is not a country, it's a continent. It's 54 countries and thousands and thousands of languages. So my question is: Is this imagery productive, or is it reductive? I know that it's popular."", '10:01': 'USAID just launched their campaign ""Forward"" -- FWD: Famine, War and Drought. And by looking at it, you would think that was happening all the time, all over Africa. But this is about what\'s happening in the Horn of Africa. And I\'m still trying to make sense of Africa in a piece of Wonder Bread. I\'m wondering about that.', '10:24': 'Germaine Greer has wondered about the same things and she says, ""At breakfast and at dinner, we can sharpen our own appetites with a plentiful dose of the pornography of war, genocide, destitution and disease."" She\'s right. We have sharpened our appetites. But we can also sharpen our insights. It is not always war, insurrection and disease. This is a picture out of South Sudan, just a couple of months before the new country was born.', '10:53': 'I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing. I ask myself whether my pictures are pandering, whether they contribute to stereotypes, whether the images match the message, am I complacent or am I complicit?', '11:16': 'Thank you.', '11:17': '(Applause)'}"

When I was 24, I found myself living in a small beach town by the name of Naples, Florida. I was looking for something new. I was 24. I\'m 29 now. And in that small coastal town, I was the only Deaf resident. In fact, the closest deaf person was a few hours away by car. And all of the friends and acquaintances that I had made could hear. I didn\'t mind though; I wanted something new. Lucky for me, Naples, Florida is home to some of the U.S. Olympics volleyball team, where they reside and train through the year. So I had a fantastic opportunity to play with them every day I could. And we\'d hit the court all the time, either indoors or out at the beach; it was great. Lucky for them, I happen to be very good at volleyball. So one night after a great game, a friend and I pull up some chairs by the water to watch the sun go down and chat. And he looks over at me and he asks me a question that completely blew me away. To be honest, in 24 years of my life, nobody had ever asked me. And his question was simple: ""Have you ever wished you could hear?"" I looked at him for a second and thought, Where did that come from? Then I took a moment and I realized while we had been sitting there, I could see waves coming in and crashing on the beach. He could hear that. Obviously, I couldn\'t. My entire world is completely silent. To our left, people had taken over the court and were playing volleyball, cheering each other on. To our right, a mother was playing and laughing with her baby. And behind us, cars and ATVs had passed by all day without me even noticing. So, I was quick to answer: ""No, of course not. I\'ve never wished I could hear. I\'ve never wished that because I love who I am."" And you may be wondering, How do I love myself as a Deaf man? Well, first, I was born deaf. My deafness shaped my childhood, and it\'s all I\'ve ever known. So my perspective on life and my experience of the world is very different. My outlook and my life has involved experiences that many of you have never had to encounter as hearing people. My culture, something I embody and cherish, has always been Deaf. My perspective on life is completely different. The experiences I\'ve had, something I hold most dear, have taught me to love myself as a Deaf man. To illustrate that point, if I were to walk into a job interview with a panel of hearing peers, and if I were to approach that meeting wishing that I could hear, wishing that I could speak like them, and focusing on that imbalance, do you think that I would do very well? Obviously not, right? Because in the back of my mind I\'m focusing on the negative, therefore creating a negative outcome, and I\'m certain I wouldn\'t get that job. But, if instead, I use my difference as an advantage and an asset, I know that as a Deaf man I have so much to offer their company. My experiences growing up are much different from theirs. And knowing that allows me to approach the interview positive. I can go into that meeting and confidently tell them how they will benefit from hiring a Deaf man for a multitude of reasons. And I can walk out with that job because it\'s all about mindset. So I say first and foremost to love yourself. So as I mentioned, the first reason I love myself is my upbringing. But many of you may not know that I come from a rather large family. I have two brothers who are also Deaf along with my parents, my grandparents, and yes, even my great-grandparents as well. I\'m the fourth generation in a beautiful family with over 25 Deaf members. Born to Deaf parents who understood the Deaf experience, they knew exactly how to raise me. They knew how to provide me with the best opportunities and to support me. From day one of my existence, my parents gave me language, access to education, and love. Growing up, my life was perfect. Imagine, like many of you born to hearing parents, I never noticed barriers that simply weren\'t there. I\'m sure many of you felt your life was normal, the same way that I did. Coming from a Deaf family, my world, in every way, was a utopia. When it came time for my parents to enroll me in school, they already knew that I would go to the Deaf school. I would learn in an environment that was designed for me. At that time, all of my peers, and teachers, and even the superintendent was Deaf. So, I was still in my perfect world. I was in an environment where I could grow and where I could thrive. And I had no problems; it was perfect for me. And many people don\'t believe that, but it\'s true. For me, the Deaf community, our world, was the perfect world for me. And I remember in the summer before fifth grade, I was ready to go back to school, and I asked my mom to go to a public school. She thought I was crazy. She said, ""What?! No! Public school, it\'s all hearing kids. The Deaf school is a perfect fit."" And I said, ""No, I want to learn what those students are learning. I want to see what their classrooms are like. What are public school teachers like?"" So upon my insistence she enrolled me. And after two weeks of frustration, I came home pleading to go back to the Deaf school. She listened very sympathetically and told me, ""Nope, too bad."" I was floored. She told me I needed to stick it out for a year because I needed to learn how to interact with my hearing peers, and that if I gave it a little patience, I would learn so much about the world around me. Because the reality is the world is hearing. I was the only Deaf kid in the entire school. Of course, I always had hearing friends, but they could sign like me. So that year I gained a lot of insight. I couldn\'t be involved in any of the school organizations. My friends never learned enough sign to communicate. And every time I tried to play a sport, I\'d get benched. The basketball coach told me a Deaf kid could never help the team win a game. And I was athletic. So after a year, I went back to the Deaf school where I realized that\'s my home. That\'s my community. And my community is where I can thrive. I got involved in the classroom again, joined a bunch of school organizations, and got back on the basketball team, where I helped win many games. So it\'s without hesitation that I can say the Deaf community is in fact my home. After graduating high school, I was accepted into the only Deaf university in the world: Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. It was there I gained my degree in mathematics with the intention of becoming a better teacher than the ones I had growing up. Like many of you, I sat through some math teachers who seriously sucked. (Laughter) I wanted to be a good math teacher. But I also wanted to be a good role model for those students. So as time got closer to graduation, of course I was nervous. I started questioning if I had made the right decision. And I decided to get out - to get out of my comfort zone and to travel the world. Since then, I\'ve been to over 43 countries. And the funny thing about when I travel is that I\'m constantly meeting hearing people who say, ""Nyle, you are so brave. How do you travel like this? Isn\'t it hard to be Deaf and travel? It looks impossible."" And let me tell you, traveling as a Deaf person, I think, is actually much easier than traveling for hearing people. Because sign language is something that gives me access to a much larger world. I\'ll tell you one of my favorite stories. A few years ago, I was in south Sicily perusing a flea market, when I walked into a butcher shop, and standing there is an American tourist trying to ask the butcher where the meat he was slicing is sourced from. So the Sicilian man, speaking no English, is gesturing, right? And you know Italians gesture. He\'s trying to explain where the meat comes from, and it\'s going right over the head of the tourist. So watching this very comical breakdown in conversation, I\'m understanding everything perfectly, so I pull out a paper and a pen, and I translate what the butcher is saying, and I hand it over to the tourist and explain, ""This is what he\'s trying to tell you."" So there I am, the Deaf person translating for two hearing people. And in that situation, they\'re the ones disabled, not me. (Laughter) While that story is ironic, it happens so many times when I meet people in other countries. I\'m always amazed to meet locals in other countries, and their ability to gesticulate and communicate with me, often quite easily. And I would always tell myself to visit the local Deaf schools and to make time to meet Deaf locals. But with every new Deaf school that I saw, I was sad to see that their schools were in terrible condition, and their education was greatly lacking. Often, I just couldn\'t believe my eyes. When I would meet Deaf adults, I realized a common thread very quickly. They either didn\'t have the same level of education I did or their language was incomplete, making it hard to communicate. They\'d often complain to me that the system had failed them, and now they struggled to find work. And I kept asking myself, why is this happening, and why is this happening so often? Why am I somehow more fortunate? Growing up, I thought every deaf person in the world was like me and had the same opportunities that I did. So in returning to the United States, I decided to do some research on the topic. And what I found shocked me. There are currently more than 70 million deaf people in the world with only two percent of them having access to education in sign languages. Which means millions upon millions of deaf children not receiving the education they need, also known as education deprivation. I also learned that over 75 percent of hearing parents don\'t sign to communicate with their deaf children. Which is astonishing. Again, imagine millions and millions of deaf children without an education, without a language. Those children without language and access to education exhibit signs of brain damage. In my research, I also found that I\'m a part of an even smaller group. Ten percent of Deaf children come from Deaf parents like mine. Only 10 percent. I\'m incredibly lucky. I had access to language, an education, and I had parents who loved me and put me on a path to success. I wouldn\'t be who I am today without any of those things. So it was clear to me that something needed to be done. I got to work in setting up my own foundation - the Nyle DiMarco Foundation - with the goal of improving the lives of millions of deaf people around the world. We\'ve since partnered with another Deaf organization in the United States to introduce legislation - a bill that requires all deaf children have access to language between the ages of zero and five, setting up benchmarks for their success. Because before the age of five, children have the ability to acquire a foundation in language, readying them for the classroom and for a successful life. After the age of five, that critical language acquisition window closes. I\'m working to give every deaf child in the world a future filled with a rich language and the opportunities I was lucky enough to receive. But the Deaf community cannot do it alone; we need you to become our allies and join us in making the world more knowledgeable. We need you to join us, to fight with us and for us in the ongoing battle of affording children what they need to thrive. So before I go, I want to teach you two very simple but important signs. The first is ""love."" The second, ""yourself."" Follow me: Love yourself. Brilliant! A-plusses all around! Thank you. (Laughter)'}"

One of these is ethanol, which we consume in alcoholic drinks. It travels through the bloodstream to tiny air sacs in the lungs, passing into exhaled air at a concentration 2,000 times lower, on average, than in the blood.', '00:49': 'When someone breathes into a breathalyzer, the ethanol in their breath passes into a reaction chamber. There, it’s converted to another molecule, called acetic acid, in a special type of reactor that produces an electric current during the reaction. The strength of the current indicates the amount of ethanol in the sample of air, and by extension in the blood.', '01:11': 'In addition to the volatile organic compounds like ethanol we consume in food and drink, the biochemical processes of our cells produce many others. And when something disrupts those processes, like a disease, the collection of volatile organic compounds in the breath may change, too. So could we detect disease by analyzing a person’s breath, without using more invasive diagnostic tools like biopsies, blood draws, and radiation?', '01:40': 'In theory, yes, but testing for disease is a lot more complicated than testing for alcohol. To identify diseases, researchers need to look at a set of tens of compounds in the breath. A given disease may cause some of these compounds to increase or decrease in concentration, while others may not change— the profile is likely to be different for every disease, and could even vary for different stages of the same disease.', '02:07': 'For example, cancers are among the most researched candidates for diagnosis through breath analysis. One of the biochemical changes many tumors cause is a large increase in an energy-generating process called glycolysis. Known as the Warburg Effect, this increase in glycolysis results in an increase of metabolites like lactate which in turn can affect a whole cascade of metabolic processes and ultimately result in altered breath composition, possibly including an increased concentration of volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. But the Warburg Effect is just one potential indicator of cancerous activity, and doesn’t reveal anything about the particular type of cancer. Many more indicators are needed to make a diagnosis.', '02:57': 'To find these subtle differences, researchers compare the breath of healthy people with the breath of people who suffer from a particular disease using profiles based on hundreds of breath samples. This complex analysis requires a fundamentally different, more versatile type of sensor from the alcohol breathalyzer. There are a few being developed. Some discriminate between individual compounds by observing how the compounds move through a set of electric fields. Others use an array of resistors made of different materials that each change their resistance when exposed to a certain mix of volatile organic compounds.', '03:35': 'There are other challenges too. These substances are present at incredibly low concentrations— typically just parts per billion, much lower than ethanol concentrations in the breath. Compounds’ levels may be affected by factors other than disease, including age, gender, nutrition, and lifestyle. Finally, there’s the issue of distinguishing which compounds in the sample were produced in the patient’s body and which were inhaled from the environment shortly before the test.', '04:05': 'Because of these challenges, breath analysis isn’t quite ready yet. But preliminary clinical trials on lung, colon, and other cancers have had encouraging results. One day, catching cancer early might be as easy as breathing in and out.'}"

And I think certainly in the field that I'm in, that's a really important point to be at. From the discourses that are going on within architecture as well as throughout society, I think it is time to change the way that we look at things. As an architect, I've been involved with architectural projects, with urban planning projects, and more recently, projects that engage much more with the landscape. Now I can see so many opportunities and so many ways in which design can contribute and has the capacity to effect social change. And that's what I'm going to talk to you today about."", '00:45': ""Starting off, I think it might be useful to talk a little bit about architecture, because I think for many people, architecture is a slightly mystical activity. Not many people know what architects do. A lot of the time, I'm not sure the architects know what they're doing. But we try, and it's important to try and embrace that and try and understand what that means. When I talk about architecture today, I'm not talking about the profession. I'm not talking about an activity that's pursued by a select group of people with some specialized knowledge. I'm talking about architecture in the bigger sense: architecture in terms of the room that we're in, architecture as a pervasive activity, architecture as the activity that is the creation of shelter, the creation of space, the design and the creation of spaces between buildings, the landscape. It's man's interaction with the landscape. Our construction of the built environment -- that's what I mean by architecture. It's not a specialized thing."", '01:47': ""And over the last, I suppose, 20 or 30 years, with the predominance of the internet and the wonderful and exciting advancements that are taking place in technology, one of the things that has happened is that our perception of the world has become commodified. It's become reduced in many ways to a perception that is two-dimensional. We spend a lot of our time, a lot of our lives, looking at the world through screens, whether it's our laptops or television screens or monitors at airports or in the workplace or even our telephones are now screens. And it has this effect of reducing our perception of the world. It expands it in many ways, but it can reduce it, it can turn into icons our idea or our notion of certain concepts or ideas that are, in fact, maybe a lot more pervasive than the two-dimensional image can convey. And I think that's true about architecture. I think we've grown accustomed to thinking about architecture in a really primarily two-dimensional way, in a flat way, that the building is about what it looks like, how it appears, it's visual commodity."", '02:54': ""But it's much more than that. It's much more than an aesthetic or just a sensory experience. That's very important, but it's much more than that. It's a complex operation. And a big part of architecture and a big part of design involves understanding the context in which that design exists or in which it's going to exist. It's having the imagination to try and predict or project where the building or where the urban space or where the landscape is going to be located, how it's going to be used, what are the operations, what are the activities that are going to take place in that space. And you might call those the programmatic aspects of architecture, the programmatic aspects of design. And I think that in recent times, we've tended to privilege or put at a higher level that visual sensory perception or desire about architecture ahead and in advance of those programmatic needs. We've tended to kind of create monuments, create icons that create a sensation or create effect, without really thinking through the value of the operation that those places or those spaces can affect. And it's in that zone or in that area that I think we need to start looking or trying to understand how architecture or how design can really impact on society, and how it can address some of the problems that we're facing."", '04:06': ""The big buzzword in design and in what I do and I think what everybody does is the idea of sustainability. Sustainability is an idea, a notion or a concept that's triangulated by three very important concepts or ideas: the environment, the economy and society. Well, the global economy seems to be currently in a kind of meltdown situation. A lot of work needs to be done there. The environment that we live in is challenged. We've got global warming, we've got rising tides, we've got all sorts of disasters taking place, all sorts of things happening that threaten the equilibrium of the world and the environment that we live in. And society itself is also challenged and threatened by some of the issues that we're faced with. I think we've heard about some of those issues today and the need to change the paradigm in which we perceive those things. It's really very crucial that we do that."", '05:04': ""So how does design impact that? How can how can I, as a designer, or anybody as a designer or any architect or how can society -- in what way can design impact on that, in what way can it affect that? I'm going to talk today about ways in which I think design can impact on society, very specifically on society, and how that idea of design can infiltrate the idea of society and work with society in the operations of society in this programmatic way to effect social change. This is an image of Frederick Street in the early part of the last century. And I think it's a good image in lots of ways. It seems like that little triangulation of the environment, the economy and society seems to be in a kind of balance. So it seems that in cities we can see that balance that cities are symbols or ciphers or ways in which we can we can understand the confluence of those forces."", '06:03': ""And through time, there have been times when cities have done that very successfully. There are lots of examples of very good cities which have found themselves at a specific moment in time at a point of balance or equilibrium. If we look at Port of Spain as a city, and we consider the idea that, once upon a time, Port of Spain was just a little cluster, a little fishing village at the mouth of the St. Ann's River. And yet it's grown to be such a big, complex conglomeration, a big conurbation of lots and lots of complex ideas."", '06:36': ""The Italian architect Aldo Rossi, a 20th-century architect who died at the end of the last century, made a very profound statement. He said architecture is the making of the city over time. I think that's a great statement, because it talks, on one level, about the individual production and manufacture of an object -- architecture -- and it talks about architecture as being a form of cultural production, as something that speaks to an issue or speaks to ideas that are bigger than the sum of the parts of the building, and it relates it to the city."", '07:07': ""It also suggested that it's a constant, dynamic, changing process. And I think that's a very important thing to understand, that it's also part of the program. It's nothing to do with visual, it's to do with the program. It's how does this evolve, what are the dynamics, what are the components, what are the elements that contribute to the unraveling and the creation of the city? It also speaks to the fact that the city is something that can be imagined. In the same way as we can conceive and imagine of a space or a building, we can conceive and imagine of a city. And it speaks to the idea of the individual and the collective. And it's that link -- the individual to the collective, the idea of the civitas, the idea of the society -- that I think is a really important axiom for understanding how design can infiltrate and how design can effect change."", '07:56': 'These are some images of how Port of Spain evolved over a relatively short period of 200 years, from a colonial plan that was developed following some ordinances sent out by the king of Spain, called the Laws of the Indies. Many cities in the Caribbean and Latin America were predicated and formulated on this. It was a gesture, it was a single design that addressed the needs and the requirements of those establishing cities and new colonies. And it expanded, and over time, as trade began to develop in Trinidad, the city expanded, and it grew, and it started appropriating, more and more, the surrounding landscape, until it grew to pretty much what we have today, or what we understand to be the city of Port of Spain.', '08:38': ""But as we all know, that process grew also on a kind of macro scale as well. We have the evolution and the development of this big conurbation that stretches from Port of Spain to the west and over to Arouca in the east and seems to be continuing. So we've developed into this concept or idea that far exceeds the original Laws of the Indies plan. And it's turned into a complex arrangement and matrix of infrastructures and complex issues, issues that, in many ways, have led to a lot of problems. They've led to a lot of infrastructural problems. And we share this with many, many cities in the world. Cities all over the world are expanding, they're increasing, they're undergoing the same type of development that we've undergone to the point where the original Port of Spain and the downtown Port of Spain that used to comprise the city, used to constitute the city, has now turned into this sort of megalopolis, this sprawl, and it's difficult to comprehend. And when we think of the problems, we think of the infrastructural problems: the water, the power, the traffic congestion, the crime, the segregation, the polarization that exists, the situation that has led to what's happened in this country recently with the state of emergency ... Sometimes it seems completely insurmountable. It seems like we've got to a point where we can't really control it in the way that we can control that original plan. We can't really control this anymore. It's almost as if we're victims of the city, rather than people that have willingly or willfully designed the city or formulated the city."", '10:09': 'Another phenomenon that has happened commensurate with these issues of size and scale of infrastructure is the predomination of what I would call ""typologies,"" different types of development. We\'re all familiar with the high-rise development. This is some buildings in Hong Kong, you know, the magnificent, tall structures that cost a fortune to build. But they predominate; it\'s almost as if you can\'t have a city unless you\'ve got a high-rise building in it. They\'re symbolic, they seem emblematic with modernity and development. And then shopping malls is another predominant type, another prevalent type that all cities want to have, the idea that you can concentrate all these shops and all this retail activity in one place and create an environment for people to come and do specific retail functions and purchase things and be in a specific place at a specific time. And then the highway, the idea of cutting through landscapes to create how it\'s to increase the speed with which we can get from one point to another. And then we also have suburban development. These are all typologies that are emblematic of the type of development that has taken place in modern cities, in Port of Spain and cities all over the world.', '11:18': ""Now, there's nothing wrong with shopping malls, there's nothing wrong with highways, and there's nothing wrong with high-rise buildings or suburban development. What is kind of wrong is that what we seem to be doing is privileging types or ways of building or ideas about building above other really very important ways of how we can conceive or how we imagine space. What about schools? What about parks? What about making streets that are really comfortable to walk on and the people are not confronting traffic noise and congestion all the time? Where is that in the equation?"", '11:52': ""It seems that with our focus on these types of structures and these typologies, which are motivated and driven primarily because they generate profit, they're part of an economic consumer system, they generate profit, that's why they're favored, that's why they are privileged above other types of development. But schools, parks, elements of cities that used to be really significant and really important are being diminished and marginalized as a consequence of the focus on this type of development. They're undermining the integrity of the city, they're undermining the capacity of the city to accommodate social interaction, to accommodate everybody, because the other thing is they're also exclusive. To work in a high-end office, you need to be qualified, you need to be educated, or you need to have access or the resources to get the qualifications or the training that allow you to get the job in there. If you don't have those, you work outside somewhere. We're not concerned about what those places are like, you just go and work somewhere else."", '12:54': ""Similarly, those people that used to live in the cities or used to live and contribute to the life of cities are being pushed out because buildings like high-rise buildings push them out. There's a premium on land price that pushes people out of cities. People can't go to shopping malls unless they've got cars, because those malls are generally located on the peripheries of cities. People can't go buy things in shopping malls, because they don't have enough disposable income; they're not going to spend money there. So those types of buildings, whilst they work for sectors of society, don't work for everybody. They're not equitable. Yet, an undue amount of attention is paid by government, by society on ensuring that those types of buildings proliferate, because they're seen as positive aspects of development -- at the expense of types of building and types of program that could be beneficial to everybody, types of program that encourage interaction, that encourage education, that encourage people to be with each other and encourage a sense of community. These types of development dissipate society, they disaggregate society, they polarize society. They create isolated groups of activity to which access depends upon how much money you've got in your pocket. It's a polarizing and negative force. We see it in this city, and we're seeing it more and more other cities."", '14:12': ""And what ends up happening is that we end up with this sort of stack, that's like a time bomb. At some point the system must collapse, it's really not sustainable. It's like the economic system in the world today -- it's really not a sustainable system, and we have to find ways of addressing it. Design can't provide the solution, but what it can address is some of the conditions that people live with. It can address some of the circumstances in which people find themselves, some of the areas of cities to which people have been shunted or pushed aside because they can no longer afford to live in the center, and they can't participate actively or fully in this consumerized, capitalized system. And we need to try and conceive of how we can transform these types of spaces, how we can integrate the activities that happen in these types of spaces within a bigger picture, how we can identify small moves or small gestures, whether through design or economic initiative or social initiative that effect change and that allow transformation of spaces that encourage and facilitate greater participation. And there are lots of ways of doing that. And whilst it might seem complex when we look at cities, when we look at the aggregate parts of cities, it may seem insurmountable. But if we try and isolate individual acts, individual ways of looking at things and formulate a program, a manner or way of understanding how we can do that, then we can get nearer to achieving or effecting some kind of social change."", '15:38': 'And there are examples in the world where that\'s been done. Barcelona is a really good example of a city where people sat down and collectively and actively tried to conceive of ways in which they could effect change, and they did it very successfully. And nearer to home, in Bogotá, Enrique Peñalosa, the mayor of Bogotá, when he took office, he decided, ""I\'m not going to spend billions of dollars on creating more highways. I\'m going to appropriate the funds I have, and I\'m going to create places -- parks that everybody can use, public spaces that people can use."" And as he created, more and more people came into those spaces. And those spaces were very effective in encouraging participation, encouraging senses of community amongst people, getting people to come together to forget what little trifling contests they had between each other, to start doing things together, to start moving around the city together and try to start acting together.', '16:32': ""So there are ways of doing it; there are models. And it comes back to this idea of program. What's our program? Well, I think we want to create equitable society. Then we want to create societies where there's active and equitable participation for everybody and where we can break down some of those inhibitions, those barriers. We can remove economic stigma, we can remove stigma around race, around where you live, around all those factors and try and bring people together in constructed and effective ways. In Trinidad, there are a number of examples. There are opportunities to do this all over the place."", '17:05': ""This is City Gate. It's the entrance to the city for tens of thousands of people. People come in and out of it every day. And yet, what they're confronted with is pretty bleak, horrid, grey, unwelcoming and sometimes unsafe because of all the traffic zooming around. And that space from City Gate that moves up to Independence Square could be a really wonderful experience, you know, with landscaping, with proper accommodation of the sort of facilities and amenities that people would need and would enjoy. It could become a really very important civic space."", '17:39': ""This is the Prado in Havana. It's just a notional idea of how that space could be treated so that movement in and out of the city every day becomes a really important and uplifting transition from the maxi taxi to the place where you work. In San Fernando we've got the waterfront, which is a really very beautiful part of this landscape in this country, but is in complete neglect. There are some really beautiful, fine examples of 19th-century architecture that form, in and of themselves, some really fine spaces."", '18:09': ""We need to we need to look at those spaces, we need to appropriate them, we need to determine uses for those spaces that would encourage all types of activity: spaces for performance, spaces for children to play in and learn that it's cool and it's OK and it's fun to be around other people, spaces for people to do all the kinds of activities that people like to do, that they enjoy doing collectively and that benefit society and encourage people to interact, regardless of their social or economic circumstance, or places for people to reflect, parks, places for people to sit and relax. And there are lots of ways we can do that, ways in which we can address and look at how we break down those barriers. We can do it with architectural language. We can look at the ways that spaces are formulated to break down divisions and barriers between inside and outside, between green and hard surfaces and try and generate spaces that really encourage interaction, encourage people to do things together and encourage a sense of community. We need to mandate government, we need to provide examples to developers, to people to generate that the benefit of these may not be measured in a financial return on investment, but the social benefit to us all is really immeasurable in the long run."", '19:20': ""And if we do that, I think we can demonstrate -- and we've demonstrated in the past that designers had the capacity to do that -- I think if we can do that, we can demonstrate to people that society is an inclusive community, and that if everybody is included, and if everybody feels part of the society, then we have a much better chance of ensuring a sustainable future."", '19:40': 'Thank you.'}"

Infectious disease specialist Ofer Levy introduces this promising medical approach, in which tailored inoculations will enable effective immunization of the most vulnerable among us, including the young and elderly, and shares how we're now venturing into a new era of sustaining and supporting human life. (This talk contains graphic medical imagery.)",00:11:36,11.6,181141,2020-06-18T14:58:11+00:00,"['medicine', 'science', 'public health', 'Vaccines', 'medical research', 'disease', 'TEDx']","['English', 'Español', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Português de Portugal', 'Română', 'עברית', 'العربية', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ', '中文 (繁體)']",Ofer Levy,Physician and scientist,"{'00:10': ""It is hard to overstate the beneficial effects of immunization. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, US children born over the last 20 years -- for those children, vaccines will prevent greater than 322 million illnesses, greater than 21 million hospitalizations and greater than 730,000 deaths, with the societal cost savings of nearly 1.4 trillion dollars. Those are big numbers. But let's zoom in and look at a particular example."", '00:45': ""Vaccines have nearly eliminated a bacterial infection called Haemophilus influenzae. This bacterium used to infect young infants causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, meningitis, death or permanent disability. As a young pediatrician, I saw a few cases. You folks probably have never heard of this disease, because vaccines have been so effective. You could see in the graph on the right that since the introduction of vaccines, the incidence of Haemophilus bacterial infections has plummeted like a rock, and it's nearly vanished. So vaccines are generally a success story. But we also face challenges."", '01:26': ""For one, for most vaccines, we need to give multiple doses to achieve or maintain protection. The scientific community is working on developing single-shot vaccines. Imagine being able to get only one influenza shot your whole life and not having to get a seasonal flu vaccine. Certain microbes are difficult to immunize against. A classic example is human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The need is urgent, progress is being made; we're not there yet. Another critical element in vaccine research right now is optimizing vaccines for the most vulnerable among us, the very young and the elderly. And this is an active area of research."", '02:11': ""Finally, one of the biggest challenges we unfortunately face right now are anti-vax attitudes. In fact, it's alarming that over 100,000 infants and children in the United States have not received any vaccines, and that number is growing. In fact, the World Health Organization, or WHO, has declared anti-vax attitudes as one of the 10 most important threats to human health in the world today. This graphic illustrates the spread of anti-vax sentiment in the state of California, from the year 2000 to 2013, by looking at the percentage of public kindergarten students who claim the personal exemption against immunization."", '02:57': ""Anti-vax sentiment is on the rise, and it has very real consequences. Many of you may be aware of the fact that we're seeing infections that we thought we conquered long ago coming back. Measles outbreaks have been reported in multiple US states. And many have forgotten, but measles is very infectious and dangerous. Just a few viral particles can infect an individual. And there have been even reports at sporting events and at an Olympic stadium where the virus, through the air, travels long distances and infects a vulnerable person in the crowd. In fact, if I had a measles cough right now,"", '03:34': '(Coughs)', '03:36': 'somebody in the back of this auditorium could get infected. And this has had very real-world consequences. Just a few months ago, an airline stewardess contracted measles on a flight, the virus entered her brain and caused encephalitis, and she died. So people are now dying due to this anti-vax sentiment.', '03:58': ""I do want to take a few minutes to address those who don't believe in vaccines and who resist vaccines. As a pediatrician who receives my yearly flu vaccination, as a parent of three children who have been vaccinated according to the recommended schedule, and as a pediatric infectious disease consultant who has taken care of young children with meningitis that would have been preventable had their parents accepted immunization, this is a personal matter to me. Let's take a look at who is going to pay the price if we start dialing back the amount of vaccination in our society. This graph depicts, on the Y axis, the number of individuals dying of infection in the world. And on the X axis, the age of the individuals who are dying. And as you can see, it's very much a U-shaped distribution, and it's particularly stark in the very young ages. So vaccines shield the very young from infection. And if we want to talk, my friends, about what vaccines cause, because there's a lot of speculation, unfounded speculation on the internet, of what vaccines cause, vaccines cause adults, OK? That's what they cause. And the other thing that they cause is for elderly individuals to live longer. Because they are shielded against influenza and other killers of the elderly."", '05:21': ""Now, let's talk a little bit about how we can improve vaccines even further. We can create vaccines that can immunize the most vulnerable among us and perhaps even vaccines that protect with single shots. Let me go over a little bit of the immunology. In the top panel, what you see is a simple vaccine. All vaccines contain something called an antigen. The antigen is like a piece of a germ, of a microbe, that your body remembers, right? It forms antibodies and those antibodies can protect you. So those kind of vaccines can induce an immune response, but as you see here, that immune response tends to go up and back down, and you need to get another dose and another dose to maintain protection. What can we do?"", '06:05': 'We and other scientists around the world are finding molecules that can boost a vaccine response. Those are called adjuvants, from the Latin ""adjuvare,"" to help or aid. Adjuvants are molecules we might add to a vaccine to get a stronger response. And in the presence of the adjuvant, depicted here in red, you have a much more profound activation of the white blood cells of your immune system, and generate a much more profound immune response, with much higher antibody levels, more rapidly, and that lasts a long time for durable immunity. Interestingly, these adjuvants have different effects depending on the age or other demographic factors of the individual. Which brings me to the notion of precision vaccines.', '06:48': ""This is the idea that we will take precision medicine -- you know what precision medicine is, right, that's the idea that populations may vary in their response to a particular medicine -- and apply that to vaccines. Right? And here in Boston Children's Hospital at the Precision Vaccines Program I direct, we have five approaches, stepwise approaches we take, to build precision vaccines that are tailored to vulnerable populations."", '07:16': ""Number one, we need to understand what the attitude of a given population is towards a vaccine. You could build the most sophisticated vaccine in the world, but if nobody wants to take it, you're going nowhere. Number two, we have to think of the route of immunization. Most vaccines are intramuscular, or IM, but there are others, intranasal, oral and others. Then, as I just described to you, vaccines have components. All vaccines have an antigen, that's the part of the microbe that your body remembers, that you might make antibodies or cell-mediated immunity against. And we might add an adjuvant, as we talked about, to boost an immune response. But guess what? There are many different antigens to choose from and many different adjuvants. How are we going to make that decision? And the menu of these keeps growing."", '08:02': 'So on our team, we\'ve developed ways to test vaccines outside the body -- in Latin, that\'s ""in vitro"" -- in a tissue culture dish. So we use tissue engineering with blood cells to immunize outside the body and study the effect of the vaccine against, for example, infants or elderly individuals or others. And if you think about it, this is critical, because if you look at all the infections we want to build vaccines against, like Zika virus and Ebola virus and HIV and others, all the candidate antigens, all the candidate adjuvants, all the different populations, it\'s going to be impossible to do large, phase III clinical trials for every combination. This is where we think being able to test vaccines outside the body can make a big difference to accelerate vaccine development.', '08:52': ""And finally, this whole effort is to drive an immune response that will protect against that particular pathogen, getting antibodies and other cells to defend the body. We are also using additional innovative approaches to bring the most cutting-edge science to vaccine development. We're taking a deeper dive as to how current vaccines protect. We've formed an international consortium to study how hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns from hepatitis B infection. And to do this, we've developed a technique called small sample, big data. We can get a tiny little drop of baby blood before immunization, and take a tiny little drop after immunization, and we can measure the inventory of all the cells, and all the genes and all the molecules in that drop of blood, and we can compare after the vaccine to before the vaccine in that same baby and understand in a deep way exactly how that successful vaccine protects. And those lessons we can use to build the next vaccines in the future. So this diagram is really illustrating a tiny drop of blood yielding huge amounts of information, tens of thousands of analytes, and that hairball is meant to depict the gene pathways that are turned on and the molecular pathways that are turned on. So much more to come on that, and very exciting science."", '10:12': ""So we are partnering with scientists around the world to bring all these new technologies to invigorate vaccine development in a Precision Vaccines network. We are going to advance personalized vaccines for vulnerable populations around the world. Our team includes scientists, technical experts and physicians. And we're developing vaccines against infectious diseases like pertussis, which is whooping cough. We have a whooping cough vaccine, but it requires multiple doses, and the immunity keeps dropping. We want to develop a single-shot pertussis vaccine. We're working on a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, the number one cause of infant hospitalization in the United States. A better vaccine against influenza, and, of course, HIV. We're also looking at vaccines against cancer, allergy and, interestingly, opioid overdose."", '11:05': ""So, this is my final message to you. Vaccines protect you and your loved ones and the people around you. Not only do they protect you against infection, they prevent you from spreading it to others. Get immunized. Scientific progress is fragile and can be lost. We must foster accurate and respectful public dialogue. And finally, we're on the verge of great things, a new era of vaccination. We've just scratched the surface of what can be accomplished. Please advocate for this research."", '11:36': 'Thank you.', '11:37': '(Applause)'}"

Don't eat deli meats, do this particular prenatal test. Why did you make that choice? Why didn't you make a different choice? I felt like I was being told to do things, and I never got the answer to why."", '00:14': '[The Way We Work]', '00:18': ""Sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can't seem to win. If I go back to work, I spend less time with my kid. What if they don't get the attention they need to adequately develop? If I stay home and give up my income stream, will I look back and regret my decision? There's a lot of conflicting advice out there about whether to stay home or go back to work, so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and emotional. You love your kids and want what's best for them, but how do you determine what best means when everyone has a different opinion?"", '00:46': ""There are many variations of parents that a household can have, and I think more families should be asking the question of whether it makes sense for the male partner to stay home. But the truth is that in the current time, most of the discussions about stay-at-home parents focus on women in particular. And it's usually the women who say they feel that what they do during the day is going to determine at a deep level what kind of mom and person they are. That is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent. And when you're met with the side-eye after telling someone you're going back to work or not, it can poke holes in your confidence."", '01:18': ""I decided to dig in and find out. Is it better to stay at home or go back to work? It's an emotional decision, yes, but as an economist I've learned that we can use data to help navigate through those emotional decisions and feel confident we're making the best decision for our family. Specifically there are three main factors you should consider before you decide."", '01:35': ""First, you need to think about how this decision will affect your family budget. Let's do some numbers. Say your total household income is 100,000 dollars, with you and your partner making 50,000 each. That means you bring home about 85,000 dollars after taxes. If both of you work and the family pays 1,500 dollars a month for childcare, your total disposable income would be 67,000 dollars a year."", '01:58': ""Are you with me so far? If you decide to stay home, your family makes less but you don't pay for childcare. Your disposable income goes down in this scenario, but not by as much as it would if you didn't factor in the childcare. It becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area. A full-time nanny can run 40, 50,000 dollars a year depending on where you live. If that's the case in your neighborhood, in the scenario I outlined, it would completely wipe out one parent's income, and you'd be better off financially with one parent staying home. Of course, this is only a short-term analysis. Childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school, and you may make a higher income later, so you want to factor that in if you can."", '02:37': ""Once you've done the math, you'll know what's possible and you'll be able to make a more informed choice, which should feel empowering."", '02:43': ""Second, it's time to talk about what's best for your child. You may think this should be the core of your decision, but there's actually no right answer. According to studies from Europe and the US, the decision to go back to work or stay at home won't actually make or break your child's future success. Research shows that two parents working full-time has a similar effect on your child's future test scores and income to one parent working and one not. What seems to be most important is the environment your child is in during their spare time. As long as they're engaging in enriching activities; reading, practicing their motor skills, interacting with other kids, they're going to thrive whether or not you're at home."", '03:22': 'There is a bit of nuance in the data. For example, studies have found, that if both parents work, kids from poorer families are impacted positively, and kids from richer families are impacted less positively. So depending on your household configuration, the effects on your child could be a little positive, or a little negative, but the overall impact is negligible.', '03:43': ""Now I want to call out an exception: maternity leave. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that babies do better when their mothers take some maternity leave. The early days with your child can impact their development, so if you have paid leave, you should take it, and if you don't, maybe consider taking some unpaid leave for those first few months, if your budget allows."", '04:03': 'And finally, ask yourself, what do I want? While this may seem simple, it\'s the factor that feels most taboo to explore. In talking to parents I find that when a woman chooses to stay home, she often feels obligated to say she made this choice for her children\'s optimal development. Which, sure, can be part of the reason, but a perfectly acceptable answer is, ""this is the lifestyle I prefer,"" or ""this is what works for my family."" The same goes for the working mother. Saying, ""I like my job, and that\'s why I went back to work,"" is enough. If you want to go back to work, that\'s great. You\'re lucky to have a job that you love and you have every right to keep it once you become a parent.', '04:40': ""Be honest with yourself about what you'd like to do. If you're upfront about that, you're guaranteed to feel happier, which will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be, and isn't that the whole point? There is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting. The best decision is the one that will make you -- and your family -- the happiest. Up to you to decide what's next. By acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not is just that, a choice, with factors pushing you in various directions, we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best for our families.""}"

In the distance, on an otherwise uninhabited island, loomed large black letters that spelled the word ""FOREVER."" The sign was 15 feet tall and 50 feet wide, large enough so that on a clear day, you really could see ""FOREVER,"" the word perfectly visible and legible in the distance.', '00:36': 'But on some days, a thick white fog would roll in off the ocean, erasing the word and the view altogether. And sometimes, like in this video, you could barely see ""FOREVER"" peeking out of the shifting fog, accompanied only by the rhythmic warning sounds of fog horns.', '00:57': '(Sound of fog horn)', '01:02': '(Sound of fog horn)', '01:06': 'It started out as a fairly simple idea, albeit a little strange, to put the word ""FOREVER"" in the landscape so it could appear and disappear in the fog. But it took over a year to plan and execute, and it required the help of so many people, like the lobster boat captain, who helped transport all of the materials to the island. And the volunteers, who helped carry thousands of pounds of wood and steel to the top of the hill through waist-high shrubs. And in the end, ""FOREVER"" only lasted for three weeks.', '01:40': '(Laughter)', '01:43': ""So if you're wondering why I did it at all, as I often did during that process, it might help for you to know a little bit more about me and my upbringing.

I witnessed the racism and oppression of people of color I knew and loved on a daily basis, but because of my own skin color, there was no way I could fully comprehend it. But I had the privilege to experience, firsthand, one of the most influential social movements of the 20th century.', '03:01': 'And the thing that left a long-lasting impression on me was how the people I met in South Africa could envision a better future for themselves and their country. A future they really believed was possible. And then they worked together, relentlessly, for decades, until they achieved that extraordinary historic change. I was there to see Nelson Mandela released from prison, and I watched an entire country begin a major transformation. And that transformed me as a person. It instilled in me a sense of wonder and optimism and possibility that permeates everything I create.', '03:47': 'I make sculptures like ""FOREVER"" as a way of giving physical, tangible forms to language and time.

They often point out things we would otherwise overlook, like this sign on the side of the highway in Texas. [TEMPTATIONS] They can often signify things that we can't see at all, like the distance to our destination. Signs often help to orient us in the world [You are on an island] by telling us where we are now and what's happening in the present moment, but they can also help us zoom out, shift our perspective and get a glimpse of the bigger picture."", '04:57': 'Imagine, for example, you\'re walking down the street in Philadelphia. A city in the US that contains so much history, the birthplace of our constitution. But imagine you\'re walking down the street in an area that\'s undergoing a huge transformation due to gentrification. And as you walk down that street, you notice something flashing up above you. So you look up and you see this. A flashing neon sign that says ""All the light you see is from the past,"" and then ""All you see is past,"" before turning off completely for a brief moment. It asks you to stop and notice the history embedded in everything that you see. And it reminds you that because light takes time to travel across space, even from just across the street or across the room, everything you\'re seeing in the present moment is technically an image of the past.', '06:03': 'Signs influence the way we all navigate the world, which means they have the ability to create a collective experience or understanding. My time in South Africa taught me that when people are able to find common ground and work together towards a mutual goal, powerful things can happen and so much more becomes possible. And I want to create more opportunities for people to find that kind of common ground. I want people to feel the power of collaboration, sometimes quite literally.', '06:39': 'A few years ago, a friend of mine showed me how our bodies can safely conduct small amounts of electricity.

I want to talk about how changing the way we perceive sharks and interact with them could change our environment, economies, and lives for the better. But first, I want to introduce you to someone who has positively influenced and inspired my life\'s work, passion, and focus. She\'s intelligent, she\'s graceful, beautiful, efficient, but what I admire her most for is her very important work and role. What most people don\'t know is that without her work and influence, none of our lives would be the same. And I wanted to describe her to you first, before I showed you her photo, because I\'ve come to find that, oftentimes, we make snap judgments, prejudice, based off of very little factual information. I\'ve personally found this because oftentimes I\'m judged solely off of my appearance or work as a professional model, rather than my primary work in science, conservation, and business. So, please keep in mind the truth that often there\'s more than meets the eye, and when you take time to get to know someone and better understand them, maybe you can better value them. And sometimes it\'s a little more interesting than you think too. So, without further ado, my beautiful role model, Bella, which means beautiful, and yes, she\'s a great white shark, or more accurately termed, a white shark, Carcharodon carcharias. Now, I know you might just be noticing her nice teeth and thinking something along the lines of ""monster,"" but tonight, put your prior beliefs about sharks on hold, while I explain why Bella is an ideal role model, why we should seriously take action to redefine the relationship we have with these animals, to one based on scientific fact, to that or reality, rather than appearances, snap judgments, and fictitious Hollywood movies. Bella and her kind are extremely intelligent. I\'ve observed her, and her kind, outsmarting even humans within a matter of moments by adapting her behavior even in novel situations. This ability to quickly adapt has likely led to sharks\' resilience over time. They evolved before dinosaurs, before trees. They evolved two more known sensory systems than we even have to aid them a high level of efficiency in their very important role in the ecosystems, shaping, influencing them, and making them stronger, and better. Now, even though they are highly cognitive, cautious, and take in multiple factors before they take action, it is true that on rare, rare, rare, much more rare, occasions than we make mistakes, sharks do make mistakes, and, unfortunately, someone does get bit. Still, considering the millions of people that enter the water, the oceans, every single day, and the average number of fatalities is five to seven ... Now, I feel extremely lucky. I get to spend almost every single day diving with sharks, over 30 different species around the world on a diversity of research programs and conservation campaigns. My work in marine biology focuses on ethology, which is animal behavior and psychology, and cognitive ecology, where I study the way the animals interact with one another and their environment. I\'ve come to observe and learn some of the most fascinating things I wish I had more time to share with you tonight. But in my limited time with you, what I\'ve come to appreciate, what I feel is most important and urgent, and if I could speak up for sharks, what I\'d want to share with you, is their very important role and work, and how it affects all of our lives. Essentially, imagine sharks as the ocean\'s immune system, the white blood cells. They pick up the dead, dying, weak, sick, injured animals, leaving only the healthiest to reproduce, keeping lower trophic levels and populations in balance. We all rely on our immune systems, and the scientific evidence for the importance of sharks is mounting. There are so many studies that show one after the other that the removal of sharks has environmental and economic negative impacts - Ransom A Myers, Bascompete - effects all the way down to coral reef systems. The removal of sharks has been attributed with starvation. Throughout the respected scientific community, there\'s no denying the importance of sharks, their effects on our environments, our economies, even the air that we breathe. 70-80% of the air we rely on to continue living comes from our oceans. Either directly or indirectly, we all rely on the oceans. Billions rely on it for seafood, over 200 million rely on it for direct employments. Our lives, our futures, are interconnected. In the words of one of my human role models, the wonderful Dr Sylvia Earle, ""With every drop of water that you drink, every breath that you take, you\'re connected to the sea. No matter where on the planet you live."" But sharks are still scary, right? So that\'s kind of the problem. Most peoples don\'t know many factual things about sharks, except they have teeth, and many more people don\'t know that sharks are actually being decimated, globally, at a rate of over 11,000 every single hour. That\'s more than three sharks every single second. That translates to 70-100 million sharks killed every year. That\'s like killing everyone in Spain, Austria and France every single year. Now, according to fishing records, over 90% of sharks have been depleted. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, over a third of all large sharks have been wiped out, or are facing extinction, or are vulnerable to extinction. So, why such a mass slaughter of such an important and keystone species? Well, some of it is due to silly things like souvenirs and pharmaceuticals. Some of it is due to men and their inferiority complexes ... I\'m guessing. (Laughter) (Applause) 80% of long-lining is bycatch, and most of it is sharks. Culling, which is probably this least intelligent reaction a country can have to an adverse shark-human interaction; basically, like shooting yourself in the foot, from a behavioral standpoint, also a waste and indiscriminate killer. But the number one killer of sharks, globally: a bowl of soup. Yes, we are trading the health and productivity of our oceans-reliant environment and economies for a bowl of soup. What\'s worse, it\'s not even nutritious; it\'s actually toxic. It\'s merely for the Chinese culture belief that when they serve that soup, it means that they\'re prestigious or important. But what is classy about catching a shark, hacking off its fins, oftentimes while it\'s still alive, wasting 95% of the animal just to make yourself feel better about your social status. Consider: sharks have been evolving for over 400 million years; humans, 200,000, and their culturals, far less. We can live without culture, but not without our oceans, and our oceans cannot live without their immune systems. Like rhinos killed just for their horns, and elephants killed just for their tusks, sharks are being killed, slaughtered, globally, just for their fins. Now, I love traveling the world and experiencing the diversity of cultures, but there has to be a point when we re-evaluate the relationship that we have with sharks and animals, and look at how our cultures can adapt and evolve honorably. An ancient Chinese proverb says when you do not change your direction, you may end up where you are heading. So what if we were to adopt this idea and change the way we interact with sharks? What would that look like? Well, the great news is we already have concrete examples, places like Palau, Bahamas, areas like Cabo Pulmo, and Palmyra. In those areas, reef and fish stocks are thriving. Ecotourism is bringing in over US $314 million to local economies, directly employing over 10,000 jobs. This study by Dr Michele Barnes and the University of British Columbia is actually showing that that number will increase, more than double, in less than 20 years. So $780 million, far outweighing the global fin trade. So put at the most basic terms, even on just the monetary level, which is usually what politicians care about, a live shark is worth more than a dead shark. And what\'s great is, these shark ecotourism programs, they can support research. I was working out with Dr Mauricio Hoyos, we were tagging, taking biopsies, and I was wondering: Is any of this conservation-based research going to make a difference before these guys are just wiped out off the planet? Then one day, 20 meters underwater, doing a population count surrounded by these beautiful sharks, I was realizing by the time I gather, process and publish my studies, another 3-6 million sharks will be killed. So why study something that\'s being eradicated the rate the sharks are and not do anything about it. So I opened my research to the public. I developed a program, where people could come to learn about sharks from a scientific perspective. I collaborated with @juansharks, who is a well-known shark and marine photographer and shark specialist. We developed this program that\'s research- and conservation-based, and opened it to the public so they could learn about their biology, physiology, behavior, how to interact with them safely, answers all those questions people don\'t know about sharks. The cool thing is people actually get to get in the water with us and see for themselves, eye to eye, what sharks are really like. It\'s such a successful program as people can speak up for sharks from a first-hand perspective and also influence their networks, and change people\'s minds. We are also able to fund educational outreach through this, reef and beach cleanups, local conservation campaigns, and international conservation campaigns, like stopping the cull in Western Australia, a story for another time I\'m honestly rather glad I don\'t have time to share tonight as I\'d end up crying. But we were able to save one of the juvenile sharks. She was under three meters, and she would have just died, even though she was cattle tagged improperly, and, you know, for 90 minutes, I swam with her, looking her in the eye, and trying to tell her it was going to be okay as blood was spilling out of her head, and kind of trying to tell myself it was going to be okay. After 90 minutes, she swam off: and it was that effort. This is another conservation campaign, a little better known. It reached over 2 million people in 2 days and featured none other than the lovely role model, Bella, who is so great for her species, a great representative. At the time when we released it, it was because there was a study put out showing there were less than 350 great whites, in the area from California to Alaska to Hawaii to Mexico, an area where juansharks and I grew up diving with sharks, with white sharks specifically. We knew many of them, had spent much time with them, studying behavior, working with them. So what do you do when you hear someone you love, care about, understand, is being eradicated? Something. So, we thought, with Water Inspired we\'d try and use inspiring photography and videography to inspire people to care. We needed people to give white sharks a second look, a second chance. They don\'t make the news very often. When they do, I\'m sure you guys all know, it\'s not usually good press. So we were successful. We wanted to show the natural beauty of sharks. But most often, when people see a beautiful image like this, they just think it\'s just on its way to eat the next person, right? So, we want to do the anti-Jaws. The little blond girl, she gets eaten in the fictitious movie, right? So what\'s it like in reality? Well, I\'ve been working with them for a long time, right? We dive to get receivers and other things like that, so I wanted to show a connection, I wanted people to be able to connect, see another side of these animals, realize that we can coexist. But in order to coexist, they have to exist, and there\'s so much more to these animals than meets the eye. When you take the time to get to know somebody, you know, you can understand that maybe there\'s more to them. And so I wanted to share that with the world. And I have to give the disclaimer - I mean, there\'s just so many things that I would love to share with you guys -- but I do have to give the disclaimer that they deserve a lot of respect ... not fear, but they are apex predators, they do have a role ... and we need them for that role, it\'s very important. I mean, I could cite study after study after study, showing the importance of that. You know, if I wanted to go out into the African savanna and pat a lion, you know what I would do? I would call up the lion whisperer, and I\'d go hang out with him, and I\'d learn, and I\'d study from him, out of respect for the animal because of its reputation. So, while I understand that, especially the way that they are portrayed in the media, that people are afraid of them, you shouldn\'t be afraid of them; you should just respect them. they are beautiful animals, there\'s so much more to them. So if there\'s one thing that Bella has taught me, it\'s that, like Bella, we can all positively change and influence our environments for the better. All we need to do is take action. In the words of Jane Goodall: Every day we make an impact. It\'s up to us what kind of an impact we want that to be. Now, this was just one successful collaborative program that we collaborated with GoPro on. They were very true to the message and released a beautiful piece, but there are so many other things, other media pieces we could do, even just writing to a restaurant, asking them not to serve shark fin soup. New campaigns, political policies, the ideas are endless. What it comes down to is: Yeah, knowledge is powerful, but it\'s nothing without action. I love Nike. I get up every morning and go running. It\'s like, just do it. You may not feel like it, but any effort is better than no effort. [We may feel like what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean, but the ocean would be less without that drop.] So I want to ask you guys tonight, (Laughter) to take action for your future. Sharks and the oceans affect us all. I\'d like to see a raise of hands for all those that are willing to take a small, small action for a better future. Raise your hands if you are willing to take that action. Oh, I so see all those hands. Okay, I\'m going to call you out on it. I want you guys to use that hand and grab your phones. I\'ll do it with you. Grab your phones. I know it\'s usually rude to grab your phones during a talk, but you\'ll be helping me. This is really good. This is good. This is your call to action. Let\'s do it! (Laughter) So I want you guys to grab your phone, and we\'re going to spread great ideas globally. I want you guys to Tweet, Facebook, Instagram, something. Spread an idea, share a fact about a shark. I\'m going to do it with you because it\'s actually really fun. Even though you guys are kind of dark - Okay, ready? Smile! Okay. So don\'t get distracted with the missed call or text. This\'ll only take a minute, and I\'m off the stage, so ... All right, let\'s do this together. We\'re going to make a difference, a measurable impact for sharks. So I\'m going to Instagram. This is how the world is now, right? We all just walk around on our phones. I think I saw that on a talk earlier. This is all good. Okay next. So I\'m going to use a hashtag. #HelpSaveSharks. Okay. #HelpSaveBella. Here with the amazing group at TEDx conference in Europe, helping spread great ideas and ways we can help save sharks and our future. Sharks are important. Redefining the relationships we have with sharks. #SharkConservation, #HelpSaveSharks, #NoSharkFinSoup, #TEDSavesSharks, #TEDTalksonSharks. Okay. And I will share that. Awesome! And this is the best part. I get to thank you all for being a part of the force that redefines the relationship we have with sharks for a better future. Thank you, guys. (Applause)'}"

(This virtual conversation, hosted by TED science curator David Biello and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded June 1, 2020.)",00:48:57,48.95,177223,2020-06-22T14:54:06+00:00,"['government', 'technology', 'democracy', 'innovation', 'social change', 'society', 'coronavirus', 'development']","['English', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro']",Audrey Tang,Digital Minister of Taiwan,"{'00:05': 'Audrey Tang: Very happy to be joining you, and good local time, everyone.', '00:10': 'David Biello: So, tell us about -- Sorry to -- Tell us about digital tools and COVID.', '00:18': ""AT: Sure. Yeah, I'm really happy to share with you how Taiwan successfully countered the COVID using the power of digital democracy tools. As we know, democracy improves as more people participate. And digital technology remains one of the best ways to improve participation, as long as the focus is on finding common ground, that is to say, prosocial media instead of antisocial media. And there's three key ideas that I would like to share today about digital democracy that is fast, fair and fun."", '00:52': ""First about the fast part. Whereas many jurisdictions began countering coronavirus only this year, Taiwan started last year. Last December, when Dr. Li Wenliang, the PRC whistleblower, posted that there are new SARS cases, he got inquiries and eventually punishments from PRC police institutions. But at the same time, the Taiwan equivalent of Reddit, the Ptt board, has someone called nomorepipe reposting Dr. Li Wenliang's whistleblowing. And our medical officers immediately noticed this post and issued an order that says all passengers flying in from Wuhan to Taiwan need to start health inspections the very next day, which is the first day of January."", '01:32': ""And this says to me two things. First, the civil society trusts the government enough to talk about possible new SARS outbreaks in the public forum. And the government trusts citizens enough to take it seriously and treat it as if SARS has happened again, something we've always been preparing for, since 2003. And because of this open civil society, according to the CIVICUS Monitor after the Sunflower Occupy, Taiwan is now the most open society in the whole of Asia. We enjoy the same freedom of speech, of assembly, [unclear] as other liberal democracies, but with the emphasis on keeping an open mind to novel ideas from the society. And that is why our schools and businesses still remain open today, there was no lockdown, it's been a month with no local confirmed cases."", '02:16': ""So the fast part. Every day, our Central Epidemic Command Center, or CECC, holds a press conference, which is always livestreamed, and we work with the journalists, they answer all the questions from the journalists, and whenever there's a new idea coming in from the social sector, anyone can pick up their phone and call 1922 and tell that idea to the CECC."", '02:34': ""For example, there was one day in April where a young boy has said he doesn't want to go to school because his school mates may laugh at him because all he had is a pink medical mask. The very next day, everybody in the CECC press conference started wearing pink medical masks, making sure that everybody learns about gender mainstreaming. And so this kind of rapid response system builds trust between the government and the civil society."", '02:58': ""And the second focus is fairness. Making sure everybody can use their national health insurance card to collect masks from nearby pharmacies, not only do we publish the stock level of masks of all pharmacies, 6,000 of them, we publish it every 30 seconds. That's why our civic hackers, our civil engineers in the digital space, built more than 100 tools that enable people to view a map, or people with blindness who talk to chat bots, voice assistants, all of them can get the same inclusive access to information about which pharmacies near them still have masks. And because the national health insurance single payer is more than 99.9 percent of health coverage, people who show any symptoms will then be able to take the medical mask, go to a local clinic, knowing fully that they will get treated fairly without incurring any financial burden. And so people designed a dashboard that lets everybody see our supply is indeed growing, and whether there's over- or undersupply, so that we codesign this distribution system with the pharmacies, with the whole of society."", '03:57': ""So based on this analysis, we show that there was a peak at 70 percent, and that remaining 20 percent of people were often young, work very long hours, when they go off work, the pharmacies also went off work, and so we work with convenience stores so that everybody can collect their mask anytime, 24 hours a day. So we ensure fairness of all kinds, based on the digital democracy's feedback."", '04:21': 'And finally, I would like to acknowledge that this is a very stressful time. People feel anxious, outraged, there\'s a lot of panic buying, a lot of conspiracy theories in all economies. And in Taiwan, our counter-disinformation strategy is very simple. It\'s called ""humor over rumor."" So when there was a panic buying of tissue paper, for example, there was a rumor that says, ""Oh, we\'re ramping up mass production, it\'s the same material as tissue papers, and so we\'ll run out of tissue paper soon."" And our premier showed a very memetic picture that I simply have to share with you. In very large print, he shows his bottom, wiggling it a little bit, and then the large print says ""Each of us only have one pair of buttocks."" And of course, the serious table shows that tissue paper came from South American materials, and medical masks come from domestic materials, and there\'s no way that ramping up production of one will hurt the production of the other. And so that went absolutely viral. And because of that, the panic buying died down in a day or two. And finally, we found out the person who spread the rumor in the first place was the tissue paper reseller.', '05:30': 'And this is not just a single shock point in social media. Every single day, the daily press conference gets translated by the spokesdog of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, that translated a lot of things. For example, our physical distancing is phrased as saying ""If you are outdoors, you need to keep two dog-lengths away, if you are indoor, three dog-lengths away,"" and so on. And hand sanitation rules, and so on. So because all this goes viral, we make sure that the factual humor spreads faster than rumor. And they serve as a vaccine, as inoculation, so that when people see the conspiracy theories, the R0 value of that will be below one, meaning that those ideas will not spread.', '06:08': ""And so I only have this five-minute briefing, the rest of it will be driven by your Q and A, but please feel free to read more about Taiwan's counter-coronavirus strategy, at taiwancanhelp.us. Thank you."", '06:23': 'DB: That\'s incredible. And I love this ""humor versus rumor."" The problem here in the US, perhaps, is that the rumors seem to travel faster than any response, whether humorous or not. How do you defeat that aspect in Taiwan?', '06:44': ""AT: Yeah, we found that, of course, humor implicitly means there is a sublimation of upsetness, of outrage. And so as you see, for example, in our premier's example, he makes fun of himself. He doesn't make a joke at the expense of other people. And this was the key. Because people think it hilarious, they share it, but with no malicious or toxic intentions. People remember the actual payload, that table about materials used to produce masks, much more easily. If they make a joke that excludes parts of the society, of course, that part of society will feel outraged and we will end up creating more divisiveness, rather than prosocial behavior. So the humor at no expense, not excluding any part of society, I think that was the key."", '07:38': ""DB: It's also incredible because Taiwan has such close ties to the origin point of this."", '07:45': 'AT: PRC, yes.', '07:46': 'DB: The mainland. So given those close economic ties, how do you survive that kind of disruption?', '07:57': ""AT: Yeah, I mean, at this moment, it's been almost a month now with no local confirmed cases, so we're doing fine. And what we are doing, essentially, is just to respond faster than pretty much anyone. We started responding last year, whereas pretty much everybody else started responding this year. We tried to warn the world last year, but, anyway. So in any case, the point here is that if you start early enough, you get to make sure that the border control is the main point where you quarantine all the returning residents and so on, instead of waiting until the community spread stage, where even more human-right invading techniques would probably have to be deployed one way or the other."", '08:42': 'And so in Taiwan, we\'ve not declared an emergency situation. We\'re firmly under the constitutional law. Because of that, every measure the administration is taking is also applicable in non-coronavirus times. And this forces us to innovate. Much as the idea of ""we are an open liberal democracy"" prevented us from doing takedowns. And therefore, we have to innovate of humor versus rumor, because the easy path, the takedown of online speech, is not accessible to us.', '09:10': 'Our design criteria, which is no lockdowns, also prevented us from doing any, you know, very invasive privacy encroaching response system. So we have to innovate at the border, and make sure that we have a sufficient number of, for example, quarantine hotels or the so-called ""digital fences,"" where your phone is basically connected to the nearby telecoms, and they make sure that if they go out of the 15-meter or so radius, an SMS is sent to the local household managers or police and so on. But because we focus all these measures at the border, the vast majority of people live a normal life.', '09:49': ""DB: Let's talk about that a little bit. So walk me through the digital tools and how they were applied to COVID."", '09:57': 'AT: Yes. So there\'s three parts that I just outlined. The first one is the collective intelligence system. Through online spaces that we design to be devoid of Reply buttons, because we see that, when there\'s Reply buttons, people focus on each other\'s face part, not the book part, and without ""Reply"" buttons, you can get collective intelligence working out their rough consensus of where the direction is going with the response strategies. So we use a lot of new technologies, such as Polis, which is essentially a forum that lets you upvote and downvote each other\'s feelings, but with real-time clustering, so that if you go to cohack.tw, you see six such conversations, talking about how to protect the most vulnerable people, how to make a smooth transition, how to make a fair distribution of supplies and so on.', '10:52': ""And people are free to voice their ideas, and upvote and downvote each other's ideas. But the trick is that we show people the main divisive points, and the main consensual points, and we respond only to the ideas that can convince all the different opinion groups. So people are encouraged to post more eclectic, more nuanced ideas and they discover, at the end of this consultation, that everybody, actually, agrees with most things, with most of their neighbors on most of the issues. And that is what we call the social mandate, or the democratic mandate, that then informs our development of the counter-coronavirus strategy and helping the world with such tools."", '11:30': ""And so this is the first part, it's called listening at scale for rough consensus. The second part I already covered is the distribute ledger, where everybody can go to a nearby pharmacy, present their NHI card, buy nine masks, or 10 if you're a child, and see the stock level of that pharmacy on their phone actually decreasing by nine or 10 in a couple of minutes. And if they grow by nine or 10, of course, you call the 1922, and report something fishy is going on. But this is participatory accountability. This is published every 30 seconds. So everybody holds each other accountable, and that massively increases trust."", '12:05': ""And finally, the third one, the humor versus rumor, I think the important thing to see here is that wherever there's a trending disinformation or conspiracy theory, you respond to it with a humorous package within two hours. We have discovered, if we respond within two hours, then more people see the vaccination than the conspiracy theory. But if you respond four hours or a day afterwards, then that's a lost cause. You can't really counter that using humor anymore, you have to invite the person who spread those messages into cocreation workshops. But we're OK with that, too."", '12:42': 'DB: Your speed is incredible. I see Whitney has joined us with some questions.', '12:47': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That\'s right, we have a few coming in already from the audience. Hi there, Audrey. And we\'ll start with one from our community member Michael Backes. He asks how long has humor versus rumor been a strategy that you\'ve implemented. Excuse me. ""How long has humor versus rumor strategy been implemented? Were comedians consulted to make the humor?""', '13:10': 'AT: Yes, definitely. Comedians are our most cherished colleagues. And each and every ministry has a team of what we call participation officers in charge of engaging with trending topics. And it\'s a more than 100 people-strong team now. We meet every month and also every couple of weeks on specific topics. It\'s been like that since late 2016, but it\'s not until our previous spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka, joined about a year and a half ago, do the professional comedians get to the team. Previously, this was more about inviting the people who post, you know, quotes like ""Our tax filing system is explosively hostile,"" and gets trending, and previously, the POs just invited those people. Everybody who complains about the finance minister\'s tax-filing experience gets invited to the cocreation of that tax filing experience. So previously, it was that. But Kolas Yotaka and the premier Su Tseng-chang said, wouldn\'t it be much better and reach more people if we add some dogs to it or cat\'s pictures to it? And that\'s been around for a year and a half.', '14:21': 'WPR: Definitely, I think it makes a lot of difference, just even seeing them without being part of the thought process behind that. And we have another question here from G. Ryan Ansin. He asks, ""What would you rank the level of trust your community had before the pandemic, in order for the government to have a chance at properly controlling this crisis?""', '14:43': ""AT: I would say that a community trusts each other. And that is the main point of digital democracy. This is not about people trusting the government more. This is about the government trusting the citizens more, making the state transparent to the citizen, not the citizen transparent to the state, which would be some other regime. So making the state transparent to the citizens doesn't always elicit more trust, because you may see something wrong, something missing, something exclusively hostile to its user experience, an so on, of the state. So it doesn't necessarily lead to more trust from the government. Sorry, from the citizen to the government. But it always leads to more trust between the social sector stakeholders."", '15:22': ""So I would say the level of trust between the people who are working on, for example, medical officers, and people who are working with the pandemic responses, people who manufacture medical masks, and so on, all these people, the trust level between them is very high. And not necessarily they trust the government. But we don't need that for a successful response. If you ask a random person on the street, they will say Taiwan is performing so well because of the people. When the CECC tells us to wear the mask, we wear the mask. When the CECC tells us not to wear a mask, like, if you are keeping physical distance, we wear a mask anyway. And so because of that, I think it's the social sector's trust between those different stakeholders that's the key to the response."", '16:10': ""WPR: I will come back shortly with more questions, but I'll leave you guys to continue your conversation."", '16:15': 'AT: Awesome.', '16:17': 'DB: Well, clearly, part of that trust in government was maybe not there in 2014 during the Sunflower Movement. So talk to me about that and how that led to this, kind of, digital transformation.', '16:36': ""AT: Indeed. Before March 2014, if you asked a random person on the street in Taiwan, like, whether it's possible for a minister -- that's me -- to have their office in a park, literally a park, anyone can walk in and talk to me for 40 minutes at a time, I'm currently in that park, the Social Innovation Lab, they would say that this is crazy, right? No public officials work like that. But that was because on March 18, 2014, hundreds of young activists, most of them college students, occupied the legislature to express their profound opposition to a trade pact with Beijing under consideration, and the secretive manner in which it was pushed through the parliament by Kuomintang, the ruling party at the time. And so the protesters demanded, very simply, that the pact be scraped, and the government to institute a more transparent ratification process. And that drew widespread public support."", '17:31': 'It ended a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised and agreed on the four demands [unclear] of legislative oversight. A poll released after the occupation showed that more than 75 percent remained dissatisfied with the ruling government, illustrating the crisis of trust that was caused by a trade deal dispute. And to heal this rift and communicate better with everyday citizens, the administration reached out to the people who supported the occupiers, for example, the g0v community, which has been seeking to improve government transparency through the creation of open-source tools. And so, Jaclyn Tsai, a government minister at the time, attended our hackathon and proposed the establishment of novel platforms with the online community to exchange policy ideas.', '18:19': 'And an experiment was born called vTaiwan, that pioneerly used tools such as Polis, that allows for ""agree"" or ""disagree"" with no Reply button, that gets people\'s rough consensus on issues such as crowdfunding, equity-based crowdfunding, to be precise, teleworking and many other cyber-related legislation, of which there is no existing unions or associations. And it proved to be very successful. They solved the Uber problem, for example, and by now, you can call an Uber -- I just called an Uber this week -- but in any case, they are operating as taxis. They set up a local taxi company called Q Taxi, and that was because on the platform, people cared about insurance, they care about registration, they care about all the sort of, protection of the passengers, and so on. So we changed the taxi regulations, and now Uber is just another taxi company along with the other co-ops.', '19:16': ""DB: So you're actually, in a way, crowdsourcing laws that, well, then become laws."", '19:23': ""AT: Yeah, learn more at crowd.law. It's a real website."", '19:29': ""DB: So, some might say that this seems easier, because Taiwan is an island, that maybe helps you control COVID, helps promote social cohesion, maybe it's a smaller country than some. Do you think that this could be scaled beyond Taiwan?"", '19:50': 'AT: Well, first of all, 23 million people is still quite some people. It\'s not a city, as some usually say, you know, ""Taiwan is a city-state."" Well, 23 million people, not quite a city-state. And what I\'m trying to get at, is that the high population density and a variety of cultures -- we have more than 20 national languages -- doesn\'t necessarily lead to social cohesion, as you said. Rather, I think, this is the humbleness of all the ministers in the counter-coronavirus response. They all took on an attitude of ""So we learned about SARS"" -- many of them were in charge of the SARS back then, but that was classical epidemiology. This is SARS 2.0, it has different characteristics. And the tools that we use are very different, because of the digital transformation. And so we are in it to learn together with the citizens.', '20:47': 'Our vice president at the time, Dr. Chen Chien-jen, an academician, literally wrote the textbook on epidemiology. However, he still says, ""You know, what I\'m going to do is record an online MOOC, a crash course on epidemiology, that shares with, I think, more than 20,00 people enrolled the first day, I was among them, to learn about important ideas, like the R0 and the basic transmission and how the various different measures work, and then they asked people to innovate. If you think of a new way that the vice president did not think of, just call 1922, and your idea will become the next day\'s press conference.', '21:28': ""And this is this colearning strategy, I think, that more than anything enabled the social cohesion, as you speak. But this is more of a robust civil society than the uniformity. There's no uniformity at all in Taiwan, everybody is entitled to their ideas, and all the social innovations, ranging from using a traditional rice cooker to revitalize, to disinfect the mask, to pink medical mask, and so on, there's all variety of very interesting ideas that get amplified by the daily press conference."", '22:00': ""DB: That's beautiful. Now -- oh, Whitney is back, so I will let her ask the next question."", '22:08': 'WPR: Sure, we\'re having some more questions come in. One from our community member Aria Bendix. Aria asked, ""How do you ensure that digital campaigns act quickly without sacrificing accuracy? In the US, there was a fear of inciting panic about COVID-19 in early January.""', '22:27': 'AT: This is a great question. So most of the scientific ideas about the COVID are evolving, right? The efficacy of masks, for example, is a very good example, because the different characteristics of previous respiratory diseases respond differently to the facial mask. And so, our digital campaigns focus on the idea of getting the rough consensus through. So basically, it\'s a reflection of the society, through Polis, through Slido, through the joint platform, the various tools that vTaiwan has prototyped, we know that people are feeling a rough consensus about things and we\'re responding to the society, saying, ""This is what you all feel and this is what we\'re doing to respond to your feelings.', '23:14': 'And the scientific consensus is still developing, but we know, for example, people feel that wearing a mask mostly protects you, because it reminds you to not touch your face and wash your hands properly."" And these, regardless of everything else, are the two things that everybody agrees with. So we just capitalize on that and say, ""OK, wash your hands properly, and don\'t touch your face, and wearing a mask reminds you of that."" And that lets us cut through the kind of, very ideologically charged debates and focus on what people generally resonate with one another. And that\'s how we act quickly without sacrificing scientific accuracy.', '23:53': 'WPR: And this next question sort of feels connected to this as well. It\'s a question from an anonymous community member. ""Pragmatically, do you think any of your policies could be applied in the United States under the current Trump administration?""', '24:06': 'AT: Quite a few, actually. We work with many states in the US and abroad on what we call ""epicenter to epicenter diplomacy."" (Laughs) So what we\'re doing essentially is, for example, there was a chat bot in Taiwan that lets you, but especially people under home quarantine, to ask the chat bot anything. And if there is a scientific adviser who already wrote a frequently asked question, the chat bot just responds with that, but otherwise, they will call the science advisory board and write an accessible response to that, and the spokesdog would translate that into a cute dog meme.', '24:45': ""And so this feedback cycle of people very easily accessing, finding, and asking a scientist, and an open API that allows for voice assistance and other third-party developers to get through it, resonates with many US states, and I think many of them are implementing it. And before the World Health Assembly, I think three days before, we held a 14 countries [unclear] lateral meeting, kind of, pre-WHA, where we shared many small, like, quick wins like this. And I think many jurisdictions took some of that, including the humor versus rumor. Many of them said that they're going to recruit comedians now."", '25:25': 'WPR: (Laughs) I love that.', '25:27': 'DB: I hope so.', '25:29': 'WPR: I hope so too. And we have one more question, which is actually a follow-up, from Michael Backes, who asked a question earlier. ""Does the Ministry plan to publish their plans in a white paper?"" Sounds like you\'re already sharing your plans with folks, but do you have a plan to put it out on paper?', '25:44': 'AT: Of course. Yeah, and multiple white papers. So if you go to taiwancanhelp.us, that is where most of our strategy is, and that website is actually crowdsourced as well, and it shows that more than five million now, I think, medical masks donated to the humanitarian aid. It\'s also crowdsourced. People who have some masks in their homes, who did not collect the rationed masks, they can use an app, say, ""I want to dedicate this to international humanitarian aid,"" and half of them choose to publish their names, so you can also see the names of people who participated in this. And there\'s also an ""Ask Taiwan Anything"" website,', '26:26': '(Laughs)', '26:28': 'at fightcovid.edu.tw, that outlines, in white paper form, all the response strategies, so check those out.', '26:37': 'WPR: Great. Well, I will disappear and be back later with some other questions.', '26:43': ""DB: A blizzard of white papers, if you will. I'd like to turn the focus on you a little bit. How does a conservative anarchist become a digital minister?"", '26:57': 'AT: Yeah, by occupying the parliament, and through that.', '27:01': '(Laughs)', '27:02': ""More interestingly, I would say that I go working with the government, but never for the government. And I work with the people, not for the people. I'm like this Lagrange point between the people's movements on one side and the government on the other side. Sometimes right in the middle, trying to do some coach or translation work. Sometimes in a kind of triangle point, trying to supply both sides with tools for prosocial communication. But always with this idea of getting the shared values out of different positions, out of varied positions. Because all too often, democracy is built as a showdown between opposing values."", '27:45': ""But in the pandemic, in the infodemic, in climate change, in many of those structural issues, the virus or carbon dioxide doesn't sit down and negotiate with you. It's a structural issue that requires common values built out of different positions. And so that is why my working principle is radical transparency. Every conversation, including this one, is on the record, including the internal meetings that I hold. So you can see all the different meeting transcripts in my YouTube channel, in the SayIt platform, where people can see, after I became digital minister, I held 1,300 meetings with more than 5,000 speakers, with more than 260,000 utterances. And every one of them has a URL that becomes a social object that people can have a conversation on."", '28:35': ""And because of that, for example, when Uber's David Plouffe visited me to lobby for Uber, because of radical transparency, he is very much aware of that, and so he made all the arguments based on public good, based on sustainability, and things like that, because he knows that the other sides would see his positions very clearly and transparently. So that encourages people to add on each other's argument, instead of attacking each other's person, you know, credits and things like that. And so I think that, more than anything, is the main principle of conserving the anarchism of the internet, which is about, you know, nobody can force anyone to hook to the internet, or to adhere to a new internet protocol. Everything has to be done using rough consensus and running code."", '29:23': 'DB: I wish you had more counterparts all around the world. Maybe you wish you had more counterparts all around the world.', '29:29': ""AT: That's why these ideas are worth spreading."", '29:32': ""DB: There you go. So one of the challenges that might arise with some of these digital tools is access. How do you approach that part of it for folks maybe who don't have the best broadband connection or the latest mobile phone or whatever it might be that's required?"", '29:54': ""AT: Well, anywhere in Taiwan, even on the top of Taiwan, almost 4,000 meters high, the Saviah, or the Jade Mountain, you're guaranteed to have 10 megabits per second over 4G or fiber or cable, with just 16 US dollars a month, an unlimited plan. And actually, on the top of the mountain, it's faster, fewer people use that bandwidth. And if you don't, it's my fault. It's personally my fault. In Taiwan, we have broadband as a human right. And so when we're deploying 5G, we're looking at places where the 4G has the weakest signal, and we begin with those places in our 5G deployment. And only by deploying broadband as a human right can we say that this is for everybody. That digital democracy actually strengthens democracy. Otherwise, we would be excluding parts of the society."", '30:44': 'And this also applies to, for example, you can go to a local digital opportunity center to rent a tablet that\'s guaranteed to be manufactured in the past three years, and things like that, to enable, also, the different digital access by the digital opportunity centers, universities and schools, and public libraries, very important. And if people who prefer to talk in their town hall, I personally go to that town hall with a 360 recorder, and livestream that to Taipei and to other municipalities, where the central government\'s public servants can join in a connected room style, but listening to the local people who set the agenda. So people still do face-to-face meetings, we\'re not doing this to replace face-to-face meetings. We\'re bringing more stakeholders from central government in the local town halls, and we\'re amplifying their voices by making sure the transcripts, the mind maps, and things like that are spread through the internet in real time, but we don\'t ever ask the elderly to, say, ""Oh, you have to learn typing, otherwise you don\'t do democracy."" It\'s not our style. But that requires broadband. Because if you don\'t have broadband, but only a very limited bandwidth, you are forced to use text-based communication.', '31:53': ""DB: That's right. Well, with access, of course, comes access for folks who maybe will misuse the platform. You talked a little bit about disinformation and using humor to beat rumor. But sometimes, disinformation is more weaponized. How do you combat those kinds of attacks, really?"", '32:14': 'AT: Right, so you mean malinformation, then. So essentially, information designed to cause intentional public harm. And that\'s no laughing matter. So for that, we have an idea called ""notice and public notice."" So this is a Reuters photo, and I will read the original caption. The original caption says ""A teenage extradition bill protester in Hong Kong is seen during a march to demand democracy and political reform in Hong Kong."" OK, a very neutral title by the Reuters. But there was a spreading of malinformation back last November, just leading to our presidential election, that shows something else entirely. This is the same photo -- that says ""This 13-year-old thug bought new iPhones, game consoles and brand-name sports shoes, and recruiting his brothers to murder police and collect 200,000 dollars."" And this, of course, is a weapon designed to sow discord, and to elicit in Taiwan\'s voters a kind of distaste for Hong Kong.', '33:20': 'And because they know that this is the main issue. And had we resorted to takedowns, that will not work, because that would only evoke more outrage. So we didn\'t do a takedown. Instead, we worked with the fact checkers and professional journalists to attribute this original message back to the first day that it was posted. And it came from Zhongyang Zhengfawei. That is the main political and legal unit of the central party, in the Central Communist Party, in CCP. And we know that it\'s their Weibo account that first did this new caption. So we sent out a public notice and with the partners in social media companies, pretty much all of them, they just put this very small reminder next to each time that this is shared with the wrong caption, that says ""This actually came from the central propaganda unit of the CCP. Click here to learn more. To learn about the whole story.""', '34:17': 'And that, we found, that has worked, because people understand this is then not a news material. This is rather an appropriation of Reuters\' news material and a copyright infringement and I think that\'s part of the [unclear]. In any case, the point is that when people understand that this is an intentional narrative, they won\'t just randomly share it. They may share it, but with a comment that says ""This is what the Zhongyang Zhengfawei is trying to do to our democracy.""', '34:46': 'DB: Seems like some of the global social media companies could learn something from notice and public notice.', '34:55': ""AT: Public notice, that's right."", '34:56': 'DB: What advice would you have for the Twitters and Facebooks and LINEs and WhatsApps, and you name it, of the world?', '35:08': ""AT: Yeah. So, just before our election, we said to all of them that we're not making a law to kind of punish them. However, we're sharing this very simple fact that there is this norm in Taiwan that we even have a separate branch of the government, the control branch, that published the campaign donation and expense. And it just so occurred to us that in the previous election, the mayoral one, there was a lot of candidates that did not include any social media advertisements in their expense to the Control Yuan. And so essentially, that means that there is a separate amount of political donation and expense that evades public scrutiny. And our Control Yuan published their numbers in raw data form, that is to say, they're not statistics, but individual records of who donated for what cause, when, where, and investigative journalists are very happy, because they can then make investigative reports about the connections between the candidates and the people who fund them."", '36:12': 'But they cannot work with the same material from the global social media companies. So I said, ""Look, this is very simple. This is the social norm here, I don\'t really care about other jurisdictions. You either adhere to the social norm that is set by the Control Yuan and the investigative journalists, or maybe you will face social sanctions. And this is not the government mandate, but it\'s the people fed up with, you know, black box, and that\'s part of the Sunflower Occupy\'s demands, also. And so Facebook actually published in the Ad Library, I think at that time, one of the fastest response strategies, where everybody who has basically any dark pattern advertisement will get revealed very quickly, and investigative journalists work with the local civic technologists to make sure that if anybody dare to use social media in such a divisive way, within an hour, there will be a report out condemning that. So nobody tried that during the previous presidential election season.', '37:14': 'DB: So change is possible.', '37:16': 'AT: Mhm.', '37:20': 'WPR: Hey there, we have some more questions from the community. There is an anonymous one that says, ""I believe Taiwan is outside WHO entirely and has a 130-part preparation program -- developed entirely on its own -- to what extent does it credit its preparation to building its own system?""', '37:40': ""AT: Well, a little bit, I guess. We tried to warn the WHO, but at that point -- we are not totally outside, we have limited scientific access. But we do not have any ministerial access. And this is very different, right? If you only have limited scientific access, unless the other side's top epidemiologist happens to be the vice president, like in Taiwan's case, they don't always do the storytelling well enough to translate that into political action as our vice president did, right? So the lack of ministerial access, I think, is to the detriment of the global community, because otherwise, people could have responded as we did in the first day of January, instead of having to wait for weeks before the WHO declared that this is something, that there's definitely human to human transmission, that you should inspect people coming in from Wuhan, which they eventually did, but that's already two weeks or three weeks after what we did."", '38:44': 'WPR: Makes a lot of sense.', '38:46': ""DB: More scientists and technologists in politics. That sounds like that's the answer."", '38:51': 'AT: Yeah.', '38:55': 'WPR: And then we have another question here from Kamal Srinivasan about your reopening strategy. ""How are you enabling restaurants and retailers to open safely in Taiwan?""', '39:05': 'AT: Oh, they never closed, so ... (Laughs)', '39:07': 'WPR: Oh!', '39:09': ""AT: Yeah, they never closed, there was no lockdown, there was no closure. We just said a very simple thing in the CECC press conference, that there's going to be physical distancing. You maintain one and a half meters indoors or wear a mask. And that's it. And so there are some restaurants that put up, I guess, red curtains, some put very cute teddy bears and so on, on the chairs, to make sure that people spread evenly, some installed see-through glass or plastic walls between the seats. There's various social innovations happening around. And I think the only shops that got closed for a while, because they could not innovate quick enough to respond to these rules, was the intimate escort bars. But eventually, even they invented new ways, by handing out these caps that are plastic shielding, but still leaves room for drinking behind it. And so they opened with that social innovation."", '40:14': ""DB: That's amazing."", '40:16': ""WPR: It is, yeah, it's a lot to learn from your strategies there. Thank you, I'll be back towards the end with some final questions."", '40:26': ""DB: I'm very happy to hear that the restaurants were not closed down, because I think Taipei has some of the best food in the world of any city that I've visited, so, you know, kudos to you for that. So the big concern when it comes to using digital tools for COVID or using digital tools for democracy is always privacy. You've talked about that a little bit, but I'm sure the citizens of Taiwan are perhaps equally concerned about their privacy, especially given the geopolitical context."", '41:07': 'AT: Definitely.', '41:08': 'DB: So how do you cope with those demands?', '41:11': 'AT: Yeah, we design with not only defensive strategy, like minimization of data collection, but also proactive measures, such as privacy-enhancing technologies. One of the top teams that emerged out of our cohack, the TW response from the Polis, how to make contact tracing easier, focused not on the contact tracers, not on the medical officers, but on the person. So they basically said, ""OK, you have a phone, you can record your temperatures, you can record your whereabouts and things like that, but that is strictly in your phone. It doesn\'t even use Bluetooth. So there\'s no transmission. Technology uses open-source, you can check it, you can use it in airplane mode. And when the contact tracer eventually tells you that you are part of a high-risk group, and they really want your contact history, this tool can then generate a single-use URL that only contains the precise information, anonymized, that the contact tracers want.', '42:13': ""But it will not, like in a traditional interview, let you ask -- they ask a question, they only want to know your whereabouts, but you answer with such accuracy that you end up compromising other people's privacy. So basically, this is about designing with an aim to enhance other people's privacy, because personal data is never truly personal. It's always social, it's always intersectional. If I take a selfie at a party, I inadvertently also take pretty much everybody else's who are in the picture, the surroundings, the ambiance, and so on, and if I upload it to a cloud service, then I actually decimate the bargaining power, the negotiation power of everybody around me, because then their data is part of the cloud, and the cloud doesn't have to compensate them or get their agreement for it."", '43:04': ""And so only by designing the tools with privacy enhancing as a positive value, and not enhancing only the person's own privacy, just like a medical mask, it protects you, but mostly it also protects others, right? So if we design tools using that idea, and always open-source and with an open API, then we're in a much better shape than in centralized or so-called cloud-based services."", '43:32': ""DB: Well, you're clearly living in the future, and I guess that's quite literal, in the sense of, it's tomorrow morning there."", '43:40': 'AT: Twelve hours.', '43:41': 'DB: Yes. Tell me, what do you see in the future? What comes next?', '43:49': 'AT: Yes, so I see the coronavirus as a great amplifier. If you start with an authoritarian society, the coronavirus, with all its lockdowns and so on, has the potential of making it even a more totalitarian society. If people place their trust, however, on the social sector, on the ingenuity of social innovators, then the pandemic, as in Taiwan, actually strengthens our democracy, so that people feel, truly, that everybody can think of something that improves the welfare of not just Taiwan, but pretty much everybody else in the world.', '44:25': ""And so, my point here is that the great amplifier comes if no matter you want it or not, but the society, what they can do, is do what Taiwan did after SARS. In 2003, when SARS came, we had to shut down an entire hospital, barricading it with no definite termination date. It was very traumatic, everybody above the age of 30 remembers how traumatic it was. The municipalities and the central government were saying very different things, and that is why after SARS, the constitutional courts charged the legislature to set up the system as you see today, and also that is why, when people responding to that crisis back in 2003 built this very robust response system that there's early drills."", '45:10': 'So just as the Sunflower Occupy, because of the crisis in trust let us build new tools that put trust first, I think the coronavirus is the chance for everybody who have survived through the first wave to settle on a new set of norms that will reinforce your founding values, instead of taking on alien values in the name of survival.', '45:37': ""DB: Yeah, let's hope so, and let's hope the rest of the world is as prepared as Taiwan the next time around. When it comes to digital democracy, though, and digital citizenship, where do you see that going, both in Taiwan and maybe in the rest of the world?"", '45:57': ""AT: Well, I have my job description here, which I will read to you. It's literally my job description and the answer to that question. And so, here goes. When we see the internet of things, let's make it the internet of beings. When we see virtual reality, let's make it a shared reality. When we see machine learning, let's make it collaborative learning. When we see user experience, let's make it about human experience. And whenever we hear the singularity is near, let us always remember the plurality is here. Thank you for listening."", '46:37': 'DB: Wow. I have to give that a little clap, that was beautiful.', '46:43': '(Laughs)', '46:44': ""Quite a job description too. So, conservative anarchist, digital minister, and with that job description -- that's pretty impressive."", '46:52': 'AT: A poetician, yes.', '46:54': 'DB: (Laughs) So I struggle to imagine an adoption of these techniques in the US, and that may be my pessimism weighing in. But what words of hope do you have for the US, as we cope with COVID?', '47:16': 'AT: Well, as I mentioned, during SARS in Taiwan, nobody imagined we could have CECC and a cute spokesdog. Before the Sunflower movement, during a large protest, there was, I think, half a million people on the street, and many more. Nobody thought that we could have a collective intelligence system that puts open government data as a way to rebuild citizen participation. And so, never lose hope. As my favorite singer, Leonard Cohen -- a poet, also -- is fond of saying, ""Ring the bells that still can ring and forget any perfect offering. There is a crack in everything and that is how the light gets in.""', '47:59': ""WPR: Wow. That's so beautiful, and it feels like such a great message to, sort of, leave the audience with, and sharing the sentiment that everyone seems to be so grateful for what you've shared, Audrey, and all the great information and insight into Taiwan's strategies."", '48:19': 'AT: Thank you.', '48:20': 'WPR: And David --', '48:22': ""DB: I was just going to say, thank you so much for that, thank you for that beautiful job description, and for all the wisdom you shared in rapid-fire fashion. I think it wasn't just one idea that you shared, but maybe, I don't know, 20, 30, 40? I lost count at some point."", '48:40': ""AT: Well, it's called Ideas Worth Spreading, it's a plural form."", '48:43': '(Laughter)', '48:45': 'DB: Very true.

You could float out in outer space, look down at the Earth and everything. It\'d be so neat!"" Only that\'s not how it is at all. If you are in outer space, you are orbiting the Earth: it\'s called free fall. You\'re actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment: that\'s the feeling you get if you\'re going over the top of a roller coaster, going, like, ""Whoa!"" Only you\'re doing this the whole time you\'re orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let\'s take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea, a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you in the backside or something. Let\'s zoom way back and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You\'re going to fall down and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you\'re going to miss. You\'re going to end up on the side of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling you back in sideways. So it\'s pulling you back in and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again, and now you\'re under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up, but you\'re moving sideways still. So you\'re going to miss the Earth again. Now you\'re on the other side of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth\'s pulling you sideways. So you\'re going to fall sideways, but you\'re going to be moving up and so you\'ll miss. Now you\'re back on top of the Earth again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You\'ll keep missing because you\'re moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They\'re always falling towards the Earth, but they\'re always missing, and therefore, they\'re falling all the time. They feel like they\'re falling, so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there\'s a big problem. First, you have to be going eight kilometers a second. That\'s 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you\'re going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth and come back where you came from, but there\'s a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.'}"

Does that make sense? Maybe not. OK, so think about that. Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story, and then you\'ll figure it out for yourselves.', '00:22': ""So the second thought I had was that I would tell the story of the history of music delivery, literally from the beginning, from pounding rocks to pounding rock. The good news about this is the first 10,000 years just sailed by. So for 10,000 years, if you want to make music, you literally pick up rocks, later instruments, those sorts of things. And this goes on for a very long time. Gradually in the West, mostly we start to get a performing class, people who were experts, who were really good at pounding rocks. So, by the 18th century, we're still basically doing this. We have a class of experts, professionals, who play very expensive instruments, for the most part, things like the organ, complicated instruments, and if you wanted to hear music in the 18th century, it was live. You had to go to a concert. You had to go to church, you had to go to a civic event, you had to go hear somebody making music live. So, music always involved social interaction. There were no headphones you could put on, there was no iPhone, there was no record player. If you wanted to hear music, you had to get out of the house. There's really, basically, no music in your house."", '01:34': ""This goes on through the 18th century from the beginning, and then we have ... our first disruption. These two things actually happened together, these two disruptions. We get the piano, right? The piano was a new technology that really starts to happen in the 18th century, and then it becomes something that you could mass-produce cheaply. So you can now have an instrument that's not too expensive, that everyone can have one, that you can have at home. So this allows for a kind of disruption, but it wouldn't have happened if the second disruption hadn't happened at the same time, which is that somebody figured out how to do cheap music printing."", '02:12': 'Remember Gutenberg and the other kind of printing? Music is a little more complicated. It took a little longer to figure out: How do I create a cheap way to distribute sheet music? In London, at the time of the American Revolution, there are 12 music shops. By 1800, there are 30. By 1820, there are 150. So the internet wasn\'t the first time this happened, because think about what happens when, all of a sudden, you go from ""If I want to hear music, I\'ve got to go hear Bach, I\'ve got to go hear Mozart."" That meant you had to actually go hear Mozart. You didn\'t buy a CD of Mozart, you didn\'t download Mozart. You couldn\'t even buy Mozart sheet music, at least not easily or cheaply. But if you wanted to hear Mozart or Bach, you had to go to Germany and go hear them.', '03:01': 'But that\'s not true for Beethoven. And Beethoven figures out that, in fact, there\'s a new market. Beethoven is an entrepreneur, not unlike our other friend, Bill Gates. He\'s an entrepreneur that figures out, ""Hey, I don\'t have to actually go to London. I can actually just sell sheet music. And it can be printed and mass-distributed, and I will be famous everywhere, and everybody else will play my music."" So that changes the experience of music for everybody. It changes the variety, it changes the global pyramid, it changes all sorts of things. It creates a new class of musicians, of composers and performers -- there\'s a division of labor. If you hire Bach to play for your wedding, guess who shows up? Bach!', '03:42': '(Laughter)', '03:43': ""That's what he does for a living, right? He has no way to expand his business. But Beethoven does."", '03:49': ""Then this happens again. It happens 100 years later, so you're starting to see a theme. By the turn of the century, it's an interesting time for music delivery; 100 years later, we get the record player, the gramophone, the player piano. Now you could buy Rachmaninoff sheet music, but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff, you had to actually go to the concert hall. Not anymore. Now you can buy a record of Rachmaninoff, or you can buy a player piano and a roll that fits into another kind of recording device. And later, the radio."", '04:17': 'So think about this: you\'re a band in Texas; you\'re Doc Ross in Texas, and you\'ve got the Texas big band market, you\'ve got it nailed. And all of a sudden, there\'s this new thing called ""radio."" And now everybody can hear Count Basie and Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Man, the competition just sucks now. All of a sudden, the competition has gone global, just like it does a hundred years later, with the iPod, the internet and digital files and Garage Band, that do all of these things all over again.', '04:49': ""So now, maybe we can talk about these two guys. First of all, both of these guys are entrepreneurs. But second of all, both of these guys are software designers. That's what Beethoven does. He writes software that runs on that piece of hardware over there."", '05:06': '(Laughter)', '05:07': ""That's a piece of hardware. That's a device that you can use if you have my piece of paper. If you have sheet music, does it sound good? No, it's a piece of paper. It's like those floppy disks; they weren't very useful. You can use them as coasters, I guess. But they're not very useful on their own. So both Beethoven and Bill Gates are software designers."", '05:26': ""What's interesting is that they also both live at a time where the hardware is changing very quickly. Those of you who are old enough to remember, go back to the '90s, go back to Windows whatever, and remember your joy and your love of Bill Gates, as every time a new software package came out, you had to get a new computer. So, guess what? When Beethoven started writing music, he had this instrument up on top, with five octaves. This one's bigger, it's got more pedals, it's louder, it can do more stuff. When Beethoven starts off, he doesn't have a piano that can do this. He actually just cannot do this. He can't go -- (Musical chords) Can't do that. So in 1803, a French piano maker -- alright, think about how smart this is: If you're a piano maker, into whose hands do you want to get that piano? Composers. Artists who will use the technology and make everybody else have to adopt your technology. It's like sending Bill Gates your fastest, latest computer, because you know he'll use up all the memory."", '06:33': '(Laughter)', '06:34': ""So in 1803, Érard sends Beethoven a new piano. And it has more notes. And it can do that. So the first thing Beethoven does is, he writes a piece that can do that. If you've got a German or a Viennese piano or a British piano, it can't do that. So what do you do? You've gone to the music store. And you've bought the latest Beethoven piano sonata, and you take it home, and you've got a five-octave piano that was the brand-spanking-new, latest technology last year. You start playing that new Beethoven piano sonata, and what happens? Not enough notes! You run out of room. So, in fact, Beethoven has the same relationship with his audience that Bill Gates does. He's a software producer, and he has to deal with the hardware."", '07:24': 'And what\'s interesting about this is that Beethoven was actually smarter than Bill Gates. So when Beethoven gets his new Érard piano, he\'s writing his third piano concerto, he goes and he gives a concert, and he and uses all those extra notes. But what does he do when he goes and gives the concert? He has to take the piano with him, because it\'s the only piano he has in Vienna that has those extra notes. So he plays the concerto on the piano. It\'s great. But he realizes, ""Oh, wait. Not everybody has one of these latest things. So he publishes piano sonatas -- He waits; he delays: for the next 10 years, he still publishes piano sonatas that don\'t use the extra notes. He actually waits, because -- This idea of Beethoven? Everything you know about Beethoven -- basically wrong. Beethoven was a very clever entrepreneur. So the music he wrote for the popular market -- not the pieces he was going to play himself, but the piano sonatas -- he limits himself to the amount of keys that you have at home in some part of Southern Italy, where you have last year\'s piano.', '08:24': ""So what are the effects of these disruptions in music technology? How do composers, how do people respond? We've had three of these things, and they really all worked the same way. We started off with printing and the piano. The very first thing that happens is: it redefines the product. So the product becomes sheet music, becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home. In the 20th century, it becomes a record, something that you then take home. In the 21st century, it becomes a digital file. The nature of the product changes."", '08:56': 'Second, there\'s a division of labor. If you want to listen to Bach, you\'ve got to go listen to Bach; there\'s no other way to do this. In the 19th century, we\'ve got performers, and we\'ve got composers, people who do different things. We have listeners who can now manipulate music like you just saw. It changes expectations of quality. Once everybody\'s heard Count Basie and Benny Goodman, maybe you\'re not quite so happy with your local band as much anymore. You\'ve now heard ... -- ""I want to go listen to Benny Goodman some more."" You have now a global market. You can hear things that you didn\'t use to hear. Every time this happens, we take away some social interaction. With Beethoven, you can now play Beethoven at home. You can\'t play Mozart at home. But with Beethoven, you can buy the sheet music, you can go home, you can close the door and play the piano. And only you are there. Now you have headphones that do the same thing.', '09:49': 'With each of these disruptions, it changes the amount of social interaction. It\'s a new personalized experience each time. I can play Beethoven the way I want to. I can play it faster, I can play it slower. I can actually personalize the experience now. There\'s more consumer choice, the marketplace gets bigger. The number of titles on sale in those music stores goes up. But there\'s also less choice, because in a global pyramid, you can\'t always tell what you want. There\'s so much choice out there. How do you pick? And so marketing starts to come in, and ""Who is the flavor of the month?""', '10:20': 'There\'s one more thing that\'s not on the list: piracy. One of Haydn and Chopin\'s biggest worries is that people were going to write fake Chopin and put ""Chopin"" on it. Do you think Chopin would have been comforted by the thought, ""Hey, 20 percent of the people who buy fake Chopin are more likely to go buy real Chopin""? I mean -- I don\'t know.', '10:42': '(Laughter)', '10:43': 'But Chopin, another clever entrepreneur -- you know what he does? He publishes his music in Italy, France, Germany and England on the same day, because there\'s no international copyright, so he\'s got to have everything published on the same day. And he puts differences in every country. So if you\'re playing Chopin, the additions from different countries are different on purpose, because he wanted to be able to track who was a pirate. So, this wasn\'t something that Sony thought of. So, the question is ... This new technology, it makes more choice for more people, it makes it more global, but it also allows more piracy. It also allows for people to have a marketing filter. They have some way to interact that\'s not always direct. So the next time somebody says, you know, ""Nothing like the internet ever happened."" Well, it\'s true, but these kinds of disruptions in music technology have happened before.', '11:38': ""And the model for these disruptions is the same as we see in other kinds of businesses. It changes the nature of the product. So if you're in book publishing, you thought you were in book publishing because of these things called books. Well, you can still sell novels without books. You can still be in the music business even though you're not in the record business. You were selling records only because that was the technology that you inherited. Newspaper business: dead. But journalism isn't dead."", '12:06': ""And finally, schools. School is the next big horizon, because what were we in the business of? Schools used to be like buying gas or buying food; they had to have local entry points all over the place. But now, with the internet, we have a different distribution system. And so schools have got to think about what we're selling. But I think that the face-to-face interaction is not going to go away. There's still something of value here, as we've demonstrated today, because we're at this thing called TED, where we still want to get to know each other."", '12:38': 'Thank you very much.', '12:39': '(Applause)'}"
https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_basting_how_to_meaningfully_reconnect_with_those_who_have_dementia,How to meaningfully reconnect with those who have dementia,"By incorporating art and creativity into elder care settings, gerontologist Anne Basting helps families reconnect with loved ones who have dementia. In this moving talk, she shares how asking ""beautiful questions"" -- questions that don't have a right or wrong answer -- opens up a shared path of discovery, imagination and wonder. ""If we can infuse creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making,"" Basting says. ""In that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.""",00:14:40,14.666666666666666,172948,2020-05-21T15:02:42+00:00,"['health care', 'art', 'creativity', 'communication', ""Alzheimer's"", 'brain']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'български', 'العربية', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)']",Anne Basting,Creative gerontologist,"{'00:05': 'Thirty years ago, I walked into a nursing home, and my life changed forever. I was there to visit my grandmother Alice. She was a very powerful woman who had lost a battle with a stroke that stole her ability to speak. Alice had just three forms of communication left. She had this sound that was like, ""tss, tss, tss,"" that she could shift in tone from emphatic, ""no, no, no,"" to enticing, ""yes, you\'ve almost got it."" She had an incredibly expressive index finger, which she could shake and point with frustration. And she had these enormous pale blue eyes that she could open and close for emphasis. Wide open seemed to say, ""Yes, you\'ve almost got it,"" and closing slowly was -- well, it didn\'t really need much translation.', '01:13': 'It turns out that Alice had taught me that everyone has a story. Everyone has a story. The challenge for the listener is how to invite it into being, and how to really hear it.', '01:31': 'Now, Alzheimer\'s and dementia, these are two words that, when you say them in front of people, you can watch a cloud descend over them. You can imagine me at dinner parties. ""What do you do?"" ""Well, I invite people with Alzheimer\'s and dementia into expression. Where are you going?""', '01:51': '(Laughter)', '01:53': ""Fear and stigma wrap themselves so tightly around an experience that affects 47 million people across the world, and they can live with this diagnosis for between 10 and 15 years, and that number, 47 million, is supposed to triple by 2050. Family and friends can fade away, because they don't know how to be in your company, they don't know what to say, and suddenly, when you need other people the most, you can find yourself really painfully alone, unsure of the meaning and the value of your own life."", '02:32': ""Science is pushing for treatments, dreaming of cures, but loosening that grip of stigma and fear could ease the pain of so many people right now. And luckily, meaningful connection doesn't take a pill. It takes reaching out. It takes listening. And it takes a dose of wonder."", '03:00': 'That really has become my unending quest, set in motion by Alice and then later on by really countless elders in nursing homes and day centers and those struggling to stay at home. And it comes down to the question of how. How do you meaningfully connect?', '03:21': 'I got a big part of that answer from a long-married couple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I\'m from, Fran and Jim, whom I met on a rather dreary winter day in their tiny, little kitchen in a humble duplex over by Lake Michigan. And when I walked in, Fran and a caregiver and a care manager greeted me really warmly, and Jim stood staring straight ahead, silent. He was on a long, slow journey into dementia and was now beyond words. I was there as part of a project team. We were doing what we called ""artistic house calls,"" with a really simple goal of inviting Jim into creative expression, and hopeful in modeling for Fran and the caregivers how they could meaningfully connect using imagination and wonder. Now, this was going to be no small task, because it turns out Jim had not spoken in months. Could he even respond if I invited him into expression? I didn\'t know.', '04:33': 'Family members, when they try to connect, most commonly will invoke a shared past. We say things like, ""Do you remember that time?"" But nine times out of 10, the pathway for that one answer to travel in the brain is broken, and we\'re left alone with a loved one in the fog.', '04:54': 'But there is another way in. I call them beautiful questions. A beautiful question is one that opens a shared path of discovery. With no right or wrong answer, a beautiful question helps us shift away from the expectation of memory into the freedom of imagination, a thousand possible responses for people with cognitive challenges.', '05:23': 'Now, back in the kitchen, I did know one thing about Jim. I knew that he liked to walk along Lake Michigan, and when I looked around that kitchen, I saw, over by the stove, this trunk that was just covered in little pieces of driftwood. And I thought, ""I\'ll try a question that he could answer without words."" So I tried, ""Jim, can you show me how water moves?"" It was silent for a while, but then really slowly he took a step over to that trunk and he picked up a piece of the driftwood and he held it out, and then very slowly he began to move his arm, leading with that driftwood. In his hand, it became buoyant, in sync with the motion of the waves that he made with his arms. It began this slow journey across calm waters, this gentle rolling to the shore. Transferring his weight from left to right and back again, Jim became the waves. His grace and his strength just took our breath away. For 20 minutes, he animated one piece of driftwood after the other. Suddenly, he was not disabled. We were not gathered in this kitchen for a care crisis. Jim was a master puppeteer, an artist, a dancer.', '07:28': 'Fran later told me that that moment had been a turning point for her, that she learned how to connect with him even as he progressed through the dementia. And it really became a turning point for me, too. I learned that this creative, open-ended approach could help families shift, expand their understanding of dementia as more than just tragic emptiness and loss into also meaningful connection and hope and love. Because, creative expression in any form is generative. It helps make beauty and meaning and value where there might have been absolutely nothing before. If we can infuse that creativity into care, caregivers can invite a partner into meaning-making, and in that moment, care, which is so often associated with loss, can become generative.', '08:41': ""But so many settings of care offer bingo and balloon toss. Activities are passive and entertainment-oriented. Elders sit and watch and applaud, really just distracted until the next meal. Loved ones trying to keep their partners at home sometimes don't have anything to do, and so they resort to watching television alone, which compounds the symptoms of dementia with what researchers now tell us really are the devastating impacts of social isolation and loneliness."", '09:29': ""But what if meaning-making could be accessible to elders and their care partners wherever they lived? I've really been totally transformed and captivated by bringing these creative tools to caregivers and watching that spark of joy and connection, discovering that creative play can remind them of why they do what they do."", '09:56': 'Bringing this creative care to scale could truly shift the field. But could we do it? Could we infuse it into a whole care organization or an entire care system?', '10:13': 'The first step towards that goal for me was to assemble a giant team of artists and elders and caregivers in one care facility in Milwaukee. Together, over two years, we tackled reimagining the story of Homer\'s ""Odyssey."" We explored themes. We wrote poems. Together, we created a mile-long weaving. We choreographed original dances. We even explored and learned Ancient Greek with the help of a classics scholar. Hundreds of creative workshops we embedded into the daily activities calendar and invited the family members to join right along with us, and had caregivers and staff from every single area of care collaborating on programming for the first time. The culminating moment was an original, professionally produced play that blended the professional performers right alongside the elders and the caregivers, and we invited a paying audience to follow us from scene to scene, one in the nursing home, in the assisted living dining room, and finally in the chapel for the final scene where a chorus of elders all playing Penelope lovingly welcomed Odysseus and the audience home. Together, we had dared to make something beautiful, to invite elders, some with dementia, some on hospice, into making meaning over time, to learn and grow as artists. All this in a place where people were dying every day.', '12:11': 'I find myself now in a place where I\'m having to tackle this challenge of meeting a person with dementia across that gap in a more personal way. At a family dinner over the holidays, my mother, who was seated next to me, turned to me and said, ""Where\'s Annie?"" My funny and beautiful and feisty mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s. And I found myself in that place that everyone dreads. She didn\'t recognize me. And I had to figure out fast if I could do what I\'d been coaching thousands of other people to do, to connect across that gap. ""Do you mean Ellen?"" I said, because my sister\'s empty chair was just right across the table from us. ""She just went to the bathroom."" And my mother looked at me, and then something deep inside sparked, and she reached out and smiled and touched my shoulder and she said, ""You\'re right there."" And I said, ""Yes, I am right here.""', '13:32': 'I know that that moment is going to happen again and again, not just for me and my mom but for all 47 million people across the world and the hundreds of millions more who love them.', '13:46': 'How will we answer this challenge that is going to touch the lives of every family? How are our care systems going to answer that challenge? I hope it is with a beautiful question, one that invites us to find each other and connect. I hope our answer is that we value care and that care can be generative and beautiful. And that care can put us in touch with the deepest parts of our humanity, our yearning to connect and make meaning together all the way to the end.', '14:33': 'Thank you.', '14:34': '(Applause)'}"

She had no experience with the legal system, no money, and no power in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out over the next several months, Truth raised funds, strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding.', '00:54': 'Truth was born into slavery as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of indentured servitude until their mid-20s.', '01:13': 'Throughout this period, enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children remained in bondage. It would be two years before she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait another two years before she saw any of her other children.', '02:01': 'During this time, Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on Biblical references, spiritual ideals, and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary speaking tour.', '02:56': 'Truth saw her journey as a mission from God. Her faith often led her to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer, until they had no desire to harm her.', '03:37': 'Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government.', '04:02': 'Truth continued to travel and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful and will prevail.""'}"

The book itself is loosely structured to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is played over four rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, each with four chapters. Alternately set in China or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club or their American-born daughters.', '01:24': 'These stories take the reader through war zones and villages of rural China, and into modern marriages and tense gatherings around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of survival and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the responsibility her mother assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes the family for years to come.', '02:00': 'These tales illustrate the common divides that can form between generations and cultures, especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly to give their children better opportunities in America. But their daughters feel weighed down by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays mahjong with her mother’s friends. She worries, “In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their daughters struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them with who they really are. ""Does my daughter know me?"" some of the stories ask. ""Why doesn’t my mother understand?"" others respond.', '02:52': 'In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated from their homeland and disconnected from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle their present-day problems through the values their mothers passed on to them.', '03:15': 'When ""The Joy Luck Club"" was first published, Tan expected minimal success. But against her predictions, the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement. Today, these characters still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they speak to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood by the ones you love.'}"

I get to the local store which is near my flat, I get near the aisle where there\'s bunch of cookies, and I\'m standing there with a gaze, and I notice there\'s a little girl next to me. She\'s about four or five, let\'s call her Lucy. And Lucy has that same smile on her face like, ""All of these are going to be mine!"" At that moment, I just take one or two packs for myself, she sees how I do this, she\'s like, ""Aha, this is how it works."" She takes ten of them, puts them in her armpits and victoriously goes to the cashier\'s office. And you have that sensation there\'s like ponies and rainbows and the sun is shining and she\'s going to have a blastly Friday. I gather my stuff, get to the cashier\'s, and I notice we are in the same queue. Lucy is there with her mom, she\'s thrown all the cookies there in the basket and unfortunately, as life is, mom takes all the cookies out, just leaves one pack. And when she takes them out, you notice that the sunshine and rainbows slowly start to fade. And that\'s when Lucy starts to become a bit grim, she becomes a bit angry and starts to say, ""Wait, wait, hold on there Sparky, what\'s going on?"" And then she realizes this is not going to end well, and those rainbows and sunshine turn into rainy clouds and a thunderstorm, and that small sweet Lucy isn\'t sweet Lucy anymore. She becomes angry and shouts, and yells, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me? Why? I want those cookies!"" and so on and starts to cry suddenly. And then there\'s kind of a fuss around the situation - everybody looks at how the mom is going to react - and at this magical moment, all of you probably know, a magical thing happens. Somewhere from the store, the granny appears. (Laughter) She appears and starts to have an opinion, of course, on the matter. ""Oh, in my time, things were different."" Yada yada yada. Let\'s pause for a brief moment here. What you\'ve just heard is basically a part of my daily life. Being a medical doctor and a psychotherapist, I hear a lot of stories which people go through. And there is this myth that you have to, as a doctor, distance yourself a bit from patients in order to not get too involved, too attached and so on, which is not quite true. When you are a psychotherapist, you need to actually let yourself feel to some degree, to some extent what the patient feels. How that works is not magic, it\'s simple biology. You have a part of your brain that is called the limbic system, which is responsible for how you feel, where your emotions, yours and mine, reside. And when you have an emotional reaction, it\'s never logical, it\'s neurophysiological, it\'s biology, it could be completely illogical. And when somebody feels something, you can start to feel in a similar manner. To give you an example, few years ago, me and my girlfriend were asked to babysit our friend\'s infant. Let\'s call him David. David is about eight, yeah, eight months old. We arrive at their place, we go in, and you have like a déjà vu feeling, like sunshine and rainbows and ponies. Everything is great, you go in, it\'s going to be a blasty evening. The parents leave; we have a very nice time with David. But the infant who is eight month old is at a very special age. Everything\'s kind of nice up until one point David notices something. ""You\'re not my real parents, now, are you?"" (Laughter) At which point, David starts to cry, as babies do. For five minutes. ""Oh, David, it\'s going to be fine."" ""We just have to caress him, maybe put him to bed."" Fifteen. OK, then. ""Let\'s change the diaper."" ""Yeah, sure, let\'s change the diaper."" We change the diaper. Twenty five, for Christ\'s sake. ""Let\'s feed him?"" ""Yes, let\'s feed him!"" We feed him. Forty. At this point, you start to have various ideas in your head, like, for example, ""David! Shut up, David! Please shut up!"" or that you would just leave him somewhere, or you could just ignore him for the rest of the evening. But you realize you can\'t do that. An hour. An hour and ten. And I remember so vividly, my girlfriend was holding David in her hands, and he\'s still crying, We\'re standing in the doorway, we look at each other, and we realize we\'re screwed! At that moment, what basically happens on a neurobiological level, you can\'t act out in this instance when you want to shake David, you want to put him away, you want to do something else. But it\'s interesting to notice in yourself how you actually feel. And how I actually felt at that moment was completely helpless, angry, in despair, scared at the same time, I don\'t know what to do. If you think about it, it\'s the same way how David feels. He\'s been abandoned by his parents - bastards left him all alone with these two strangers at home. God knows what they\'re doing. So he\'s abandoned, all alone, helpless, hopeless and scared. And the only thing you can do in this instance is to just be there with him and to feel him and to help him in his feelings what he\'s feeling. It\'s interesting, when we start to feel something, how our minds change, kind of to some degree tell us what we actually feel. Every single one of us has been born with a completely different set of a brain, how we experience feelings, how intensively that happens - but we experience all the same feelings. The odd thing is while we are growing up we are taught, mostly by our parents,  what feelings to feel and not to feel. Stereotypes exist because to some degree, they are true. If we are very open about things, then if I ask the ladies of the audience you\'ll probably want your men to be emotional, right? I can just - ""No."" Someone said no. No? See? Proves my point! So, to some degree you want him to be emotional, but if you\'re very open to yourself, you don\'t want the whole emotional spectrum. You want him to be firm and stable, a man on a high horse - or Mercedes, whatever you prefer. But you don\'t want that embarrassment, the shame, the fear, the excessive jealousy. You don\'t want that, do you? The same question would be for the men. You do want your lady next to you to be emotional, right? Of course not. You want her to be on the shy side, maybe be afraid sometimes. You\'re going again ride on your high horse and your Mercedes, and save them from despair, but ... good girls don\'t get angry, do they? You don\'t like the hysteria, you don\'t like the anger. These are the stereotypes that are taught to kids already from day one, to basically eradicate some of the feelings that they have. And the more the years go by, you start to actually think you don\'t feel something, and then you put your feelings somewhere else. You start to think you\'re angry at somebody else, you start to think you\'re afraid or ashamed of something else, which is not quite true. To maybe not talk so much broadly and saying everything about you, I\'d like to share the story about me, how my feelings get in the way of my work. Four months ago, I received one of the worst phone calls you can get. In the evening, when I finished my work, my mom called me and told me those words I was always afraid to hear from her: that my father had passed away. And I remember when I came home, how filled with rage I was. I screamed and I yelled, I broke some furniture in my apartment. And my girlfriend was there to see that thing happening to me. Of course, the funeral goes by and life goes on. Then you start to notice something interesting, that some weeks have passed, and walking on the streets to work, I don\'t even think about my dad in any way, any shape or form, but I\'m looking at the people around me, and I notice a feeling in myself: I hate every single one of them. I hate their smile, even hate babies that I see. You start to notice, What the hell is happening to me? You get to work, you\'re angry at your colleagues. You want to tell them how important it is to cherish relationships, how important it is to do stuff, to do things on time, not to let things go, and so on and so on and so on. Months have passed, and I was asked to do this TED Talk. I was preparing the speech for my TED Talk, and every single time I did it, I realized it is not good enough. This isn\'t good enough, that isn\'t good enough. At some point, I even had the idea I\'m going to cancel this whole TED thing. I called up my mom and said, ""You know, I think I\'m going to give up all this TED thing. I don\'t want to do it."" And she said, ""Why?"" ""Well, because, I don\'t know, because I am going to stand there and don\'t know what I\'m going to say and so on."" And then it hit me, why I didn\'t want to be here. It\'s not because I don\'t know what to say. I give lectures all the time. I know what I am going to talk about. The reason why I didn\'t want to be here because I know I would feel something standing right here. What I am actually feeling right now. I notice my heart racing. I notice that I\'m sad that he is not here. He\'s not going to call me after this lecture. I notice that I\'m angry that that\'s an inevitable thing of life. At the same time, I\'m to some degree maybe scared or ashamed: What if I drop a tear while I\'m talking to you? How awful is that going to look? But I didn\'t finish the story about Lucy, did I? If we go back to Lucy, Lucy\'s mom could\'ve done anything. She could\'ve told her, ""That\'s not how a girl behaves. Look at that granny who\'s shouting at you. Look at the man, that tall man behind you, he is looking weirdly at you."" I\'m looking what was actually happening. And she didn\'t just keep silent and not say anything. She didn\'t devalue her, she didn\'t condemn her, she didn\'t do anything of the sort. All she did was to get the groceries that she had, took Lucy on her arms, and I heard her just so vaguely that Lucy continued to tell mom, ""I want those cookies so badly,"" and ""I wanted them."" And the only thing Lucy\'s mom said to Lucy was, ""I know, honey. I know you did. But it\'s OK to be angry, it\'s OK to be sad."" And I remember I\'m walking home from this very simple scene any one of you has maybe already seen. I go in my apartment. My girlfriend meets me. She asks me, ""Well, how was your day?"" I said, ""I started off with a smile on my face,"" said, ""I just saw a girl not get any cookies."" She\'s like, ""What? Are you OK?"" I\'m probably in a psychotic state right now. I said no. I told her the whole story about the store. And at some point I notice that my smile turns into a single tear that I have. She asked me, ""Why are you crying? Is everything OK?"" I said ""No. I miss him, like a lot."" And the hardest thing about feelings, actually, is that it\'s easy, to some degree, to think about them in your head. But it\'s much harder to actually express them out loud. And all of my patients every single time ask me one of the same questions: ""What\'s the difference that I tell you that I\'m angry, I\'m scared, I\'m helpless, I\'m hopeless, I\'m happy? What\'s the difference?"" And I tell them, ""This is the difference, that somebody\'s here - this time it\'s me - who actually doesn\'t just understand what you are going through, but I feel what you\'re feeling to a certain amount."" Question always is, The experiences we have in life, how will that impact your and my ability to, let\'s say, be there with somebody and feel these feelings? The same way as David needed somebody to be there, the same way Lucy needed somebody to be there, even I need somebody there to be there for me. And I hope every single one of you has the experience that not somebody understands you, but somebody feels you. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

It wasn't until 2017 and an unexpected conversation about LGBTQ rights in an Orlando mosque that she found herself reckoning with the influence of religion on marginalized lives. ""I realized that I couldn't run away from religion anymore because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world,"" she says. In this hopeful talk, she points out plentiful evidence that religious institutions are capable of embracing LGBTQ rights and that the process begins with having that first difficult conversation.",,,162790,2020-06-30T15:20:19+00:00,"['LGBT', 'humanity', 'religion', 'global issues', 'activism']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Polski', 'Português de Portugal']",Lyra McKee,"Freelance journalist, writer, editor","{'0:00': 'There are people in the world who if they\'re telling you a story need to tell you 19 other stories first before they can get to the point. I\'m one of those people. I want to tell you a story about a conversation I witnessed in a mosque, which changed my life. But to tell you that story, I have to tell you another story first, and I\'ve only got 12 minutes. And that story starts in late night, early June, this year. I got the opportunity to go on a trip to the United States with a delegation from around the UK - I was the only one from Northern Ireland - and we were going there to learn about \'American values\'. We were going to be travelling across Washington, Florida, and Texas, meeting with everyone from guns rights lobbyists to religious leaders and LGBT groups, people who spanned the spectrum of American values. So the thing about these trips is they offer you a number of perks. They offer you carrots they can dangle in front of you whenever the going gets tough, when you are in the 100th meeting of the day with someone whose views you find absolutely reprehensible and you\'re really struggling to stay the course. In our case, they took us to Disneyland, which I can confirm is definitely one of the happiest places on earth. I was in my element. Then they took us to NASA, which, as a Star Wars nerd, I have to say, competed in my heart for the title of \'Happiest Place on Earth\'. Someone very helpful pointed out to me - because I was posting selfies of myself at that time, running around Florida in vest tops - and someone very helpfully pointed out that I seemed to have more vests than Rab C. Nesbitt. (Laughter) I know the theme of the conference is \'bridges\': I felt like burning that one, to be quite frank. Then we got to go to this beautiful beachside resort called Cocoa Beach and sip cocktails on the beach; it was absolutely wonderful. You\'re probably thinking, ""Where do I sign up for this trip?"" ""This sounds amazing, it\'s a free jolly!"" That\'s what I thought it was when I looked at the itinerary. But I had to go through hell to get these perks. I realise that Disneyland and NASA, that these were all carrots they were dangling in front of us, whenever I found myself less than 10 feet away from the chief orangutan in the White House. (Laughter) El Trump. People ask me, ""What\'s the hardest thing  about standing 10 feet away from Donald Trump?"" I think it was seeing how badly his fake tan was applied. (Laughter) I did redeem my conscience when I got to Florida, I should say, and we met these lovely protestors, who, in case you can\'t see, are holding a \'Stop Trump\' sign. They were right up my alley; I thought they were fantastic. Our next visit was to a place called the National Rifle Association. It is all the guns rights lobbyists who come out in wake of every mass shooting and defend the right of Americans to bear arms. For a number of people in the group,  this was the most difficult part of the trip. They found it very difficult to sit there and listen and exchange views, which was what the whole trip was about. For me though, the hardest part of the trip was when we got to Orlando and they told us we were going to be visiting a mosque. Now you ask yourself, Why would I find it hard to visit a mosque? Well, for those of you who don\'t have Gaydar, I\'m gay - don\'t worry, you can laugh, it\'s okay. (Laughter) I hated myself for much of my life because of what religion taught me about people like me. And when I stopped hating myself, I started hating religion. But I was intrigued by this mosque because it was in Orlando, and a year to the week that we were in Orlando, 49 people were slaughtered in a gay nightclub called Pulse. This mosque had led the response to that tragedy and had condemned it. I was intrigued by that. This was at a time when Christian churches in Orlando were refusing to bury some of the dead because they were gay. To have a mosque come out and condemn this was a big deal. One of the victims of Pulse that always stuck with me was Brenda Marquez Mccool. She was a woman who was out with her gay son that night in Pulse, supporting him. When the gunman unleashed his bullets, she threw herself in front of her son. He survived but she didn\'t. So I decided that I would go into this mosque with an open mind. I did, and we met with this lovely man called Bassem, who was one of the leaders in the mosque. We talked about everything, and eventually, Bassem and I had a conversation about LGBT rights and what Muslims think of gay people. Difficult, thorny subject, but we had a really pleasant conversation, but neither of us knew what was about to happen next. There was a young man on our trip who I\'ll call Mahmud, a young Muslim man. He was listening to the exchange between Bassem and I, and when we were finished talking, he spoke up and addressed Bassem. And he said, ""My best friend was gay, he was Muslim, and he comitted suicide."" And at this point, Mahmud burst into tears. He said, ""I did everything I could to save him, but I couldn\'t."" And he told us this story of how this young Muslim man couldn\'t live with being Muslim and being gay; he felt that the only option he had was to die by suicide. We were all crying in the mosque, I think, by that point. We were all mourning for this young Muslim man that we had never met and now that we would never get the chance to meet. You know, when I left religious education at 16, I swore that I was done with religion and I was never going back to it. I was never going to have another conversation that I could not help with another person of faith again. When I was in that mosque that day  and I was there to learn about American values, I ended up getting schooled on my own culture by a Muslim. Because I realised that I couldn\'t run away from religion anymore. Within the LGBT community, we have a saying that we tell people. We tell them that \'It Gets Better\'. What I realised that day was that it gets better for some of us; it gets better for those of us who live long enough to see it get better. I realised that I couldn\'t run away from religion anymore, because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world. It shapes the laws and how they treat LGBT people, which we can see from the lack of equal marriage in this country. And it shapes how we, LGBT people, feel about ourselves. The first lesson I learned about being gay was that it was evil and that I was going to hell for it. I learned that from the Bible. There were times I would cry in my bedroom as a teenager, bargaining with God, asking him not to send me to hell, because I was so convinced that I was going there. This text, this Bible, I know for so many people it offers them hope, it offers them salvation, but for me it offered a prison sentence. I think it\'s the same for a lot of other LGBT young people. LGBT suicide rates are through the roof. This is the percentage of trans youth alone in the UK who have attempted suicide over the course of the last year. We see these numbers play out in Northern Ireland locally, and we know this from trans youth services, who say they see it play out among their young people. What do we do about this? I feel the only answer is to change religious teaching of homosexuality and LGBT issues. I don\'t mean we berate Christians and shout at them or berate Muslims and shout at them. We need to do the one thing that I didn\'t want to do when I left school at 16: we need to have conversations, difficult conversations, and fight for the hearts and minds of those who oppose us. I\'ve studied this, and when you ask people like Megan Phelps-Roper, who was a member of the Westboro Baptist Church, a hate group in America, when you ask people like this, when you ask former neo-Nazis, the most extreme people, when you ask, ""What changed your mind? What made you abandon your views?"" they\'ll tell you the same thing: It was a conversation. Someone who they were opposed to struck up a conversation, and they learned that that person was not who they thought they were, and they got to a point where they could no longer hold those views. People tell me this isn\'t going to happen; there\'s no way the churches will change their teachings or the mosques will change their teachings. ""You\'re mad."" And I would have agreed with them. But six weeks ago, I was out in a gay bar - not this one - with my friend Jordan. He\'s from a Free Prebystarian DUP-voting family, from ""County LegenDerry."" I avoid that Londonderry-Derry thing, I hate that. We were out there with his mum, who is a Scottish Free-P who goes to church every Sunday, and she was out in this bar, supporting her gay son, just like Brenda Marquez McCool was out in Pulse that night supporting her gay son. Don\'t tell me there\'s no hope because for too many LGBT young people, that is the only thing they have that keeps them living. And by the way, that Free Presbytarian mother went into work the next day and told everyone about this amazing thing she\'d been to called a \'drag show\'. (Laughter) Now if you had told me that I\'d be sitting in a gay bar with one of Ian Paisley\'s disciples drinking cocktails, watching a drag show, I\'d have told you you were mad. (Laughter) What can you do? If you thought you were here to passively listen to me rant on: No, I\'ve got a job for you all. If any of you are uncomfortable with the thought of someone like me, please come up to me after this event and talk to me. I won\'t bite your head off, I won\'t call you a homophobe. We\'ll just have a conversation, and I\'ll show you that I\'m human just like you. If you are comfortable with the thought of someone like me, have a conversation with someone who isn\'t and try to change their mind. Because you could be saving a life. Finally, I\'d like to send a message to all LGBT young people that are currently struggling, especially those from faith backgrounds. ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."" Jeremiah 29:11 This talk is in memory of the Pulse 49 and all LGBT people who died by suicide. Thank you very much, folks. (Applause) (Cheers)'}"

The answer sparked a decade of interviews, meetings with whistleblowers, on-the-ground reporting across four continents and digging into confidential FDA documents. In this alarming talk, she takes us inside overseas manufacturing plants and exposes the fraud behind many low-cost generic medicines.",00:16:31,16.516666666666666,164074,2020-06-17T20:04:43+00:00,"['journalism', 'pharmaceuticals', 'public health', 'medicine', 'health', 'corruption']","['English', 'Français', 'Magyar', 'Português brasileiro', 'فارسى', '中文 (简体)', '中文 (繁體)', '日本語']",Katherine Eban,Investigative journalist,"{'00:05': 'In 2008, I got an unusual phone call from a guy named Joe Graedon. Joe said he was getting flooded with complaints from patients who had recently been switched to generic drugs. Joe was a trained pharmacologist and cohost of a radio show on NPR. Patient after patient said their generics were causing unwelcome side effects or even relapses. Joe believed the patients\' claims. But when he reported these complaints to the FDA, officials there argued, ""It was probably psychosomatic. Patients are upset by pills that look different from their old ones."" Joe didn\'t buy it. He wanted someone with investigative firepower to dig into this, and since I was an investigative journalist, he called me. And then he posed a question that I couldn\'t get out of my head: ""Katherine, what is wrong with the drugs?""', '01:17': 'I spent the next 10 years trying to track down the answer. Our health care system relies on generics. My family does, too. But a decade of interviews, meetings with whistleblowers, on-the-ground reporting across four continents and thousands of confidential files -- from the FDA, from generic drug companies and from the courts -- all pointed me in the same direction: a large number of generic drug manufacturers in certain overseas countries are passing off substandard drugs as legitimate generics for profit. They are deliberately flouting FDA regulations and standards. Basically, they are committing fraud.', '02:16': 'In the process, they are risking the health of patients around the world. They may even be costing patient lives. One leading company in India has already shut down because of this activity. I wanted to know, was that company an outlier or the tip of the iceberg? What I uncovered is disquieting, and anyone who takes generic drugs has the right to be deeply concerned.', '02:52': ""If you're skeptical about any of this, that's fair. I saw generics as one of the world's great public health innovations, a giant win for patients worldwide. Ninety percent of our drugs today are generic. I knew generic HIV/AIDS medicine had saved many lives in Africa. Here at home, programs from Medicare to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act depended on them. In an overpriced drug market, generics were the heroic underdog. But my biggest assumption was based on the FDA's reassurance that properly regulated generic drugs are not only safe and effective, but bioequivalent, interchangeable with the brand and with one another. Well, that's true -- if companies follow the rules on paper. But inside far-flung drug plants, I uncovered a different, unwritten set of rules."", '04:00': 'I started my investigation by focusing on the regulatory framework. Right away, one fact surprised me: the FDA does not vet manufacturer applications by testing the drugs. Instead, it reviews company data. As the FDA\'s generic drugs director actually told me, ""The approval system requires the ethical behavior of the applicant. Otherwise, the whole house of cards will fall down."" Really? It\'s the honor system?', '04:43': '(Laughter)', '04:46': 'After nine months of digging, I published my first article on generics. I wrote about patients who\'d been switched to generic drugs and suffered medical setbacks. I quoted doctors who questioned whether generics really were bioequivalent to the brand. A month later, I got an anonymous email from someone calling himself ""Four Dollar Refill.""', '05:14': '(Laughter)', '05:15': 'Four dollars is what you\'d pay to fill a generic prescription at Walmart. Four Dollar Refill worked inside the generic drug industry. He said if I really wanted to uncover the problem, I\'d better go look where the majority of our generic drugs are made: in India and China. Four Dollar Refill was right; 80 percent of the plants making the active ingredient for all our drugs, brand or generic, are overseas, mostly in China and India. Any generic drug company anywhere in the world wanting approval to sell its drugs into our market has to follow elaborate rules known as ""Good Manufacturing Practices.""', '06:07': ""I decided to learn every detail of how to manufacture a legitimate generic drug. At a top New Jersey lab, I watched as technicians ran tests on specialized machines and used flasks that mimic stomach conditions to measure drug dissolution. But one remarkable fact jumped out. The lab banned Wite-Out -- correction fluid -- across its facility. Under FDA rules, data serves as the cornerstone of quality. It has to be gathered at each manufacturing step, preserved and shared with regulators. Wite-Out was high-risk. It invited tampering. It was clear that for the FDA's regulatory regime to succeed, any company applying for approval had to be ethical, and its data had to be unaltered. But what if neither was true? What if the applicant was not ethical? What if the data was not pristine?"", '07:26': ""I started to hear about a company in India called Ranbaxy, India's largest drug company, one of its first successful multinationals and one of the fastest-growing generic suppliers to the US market. A whistleblower was supplying internal Ranbaxy documents to the FDA. I got copies. Deciphering the company's charts, graphs and numbers unveiled a shocking swindle. They substituted unapproved, lower-purity ingredients. They invented documents like standard operating procedures, steaming them overnight in a sauna-like room to make them look old. They conjured up three-, six-, nine- and 18-month stability studies, all generated on the same day."", '08:30': ""Gradually, I was able to unearth the story behind this regulatory nightmare. In 2004, Ranbaxy hired a new research and development director. He suspected something was amiss. He ordered a young engineer named Dinesh Thakur to study the data in every drug application to find out if it was real or fake. Thakur eventually put together a devastating PowerPoint showing Ranbaxy had falsified data for over 200 products in more than 40 countries. The new R and D director showed this PowerPoint to a subcommittee of the board of directors. The subcommittee ordered the report and the laptop on which it was created destroyed. Then they forced Thakur out of the company. Thakur couldn't sleep, thinking about Ranbaxy's perilously bad drugs. So he risked his life to alert the FDA. After an eight-year investigation, Ranbaxy pled guilty to seven felonies for faking data."", '09:48': 'An FDA consultant taught me that just like cheap clothing made in distant factories, or ""fast fashion,"" as she called it, there were fast drugs, too, made in pharmaceutical sweatshops overseas with low-quality ingredients and manufacturing shortcuts. In Mexico City, I sat in a bar with a whistleblower. He handed me documents revealing how the cost-cutting generic drug plant where he worked had knowingly released drug batches that contained glass particles. In Accra, capital of Ghana, doctors explained how low-cost Indian and Chinese medicine of all kinds barely seemed to work, even when they doubled and tripled the doses. In Mumbai, I met another whistleblower from a company that I had believed was ethical. He sat there and described the well-oiled machinery of data manipulation his company used to get compromised drugs approved fast. With tears running down his cheeks, he said, ""What\'s going on in the industry is very, very, very dirty.""', '11:07': ""In the US, a confidential source who worked in the government handed me a thumb drive containing over 20,000 internal FDA documents. The emails and memos revealed how the agency's public health mission -- protecting consumers -- often clashed with its political mission -- showing Congress a steady stream of low-cost drug approvals. I also learned about the FDA's compromised inspection system for overseas drug plants. In the US, FDA investigators arrive unannounced to do surprise inspections. But overseas, the FDA gives manufacturing plants months of advance notice. It asks for the company's help arranging ground transportation and hotels. My sources also talked about staged inspections, where teams of data fabricators invent or alter needed documents to create a facade of compliance long before the FDA arrives."", '12:22': 'One intrepid FDA investigator named Peter Baker figured out how to find the truth. He ignored the data printouts, and he looked inside company computers. When files were deleted, he found metadata revealing hidden tests. The companies were prescreening their drugs, figuring how to alter the official tests so they would meet FDA specifications. As I said, this problem is more than a handful of bad actors. Over four years, Peter Baker inspected 86 plants in India and China. He found evidence of fraud in 67 of them.', '13:10': 'Wonder what happens to a batch of drugs that fails testing? It should get thrown out. Instead, low-cost plants usually sell them into poorly regulated markets that don\'t realize what they\'re getting, places like Africa, Southeast Asia and India itself. The overseas generics industry calls this ""dual-track production"" -- better drugs for some, failed drugs for others. In the developing world, this corrupt system has flooded the market with so many bad drugs that public health researchers link them to the rise of drug-resistant infections.', '14:02': ""But criminal behavior by overseas companies is only half the problem. Though some regulators apparently don't realize they're being conned, in the US, our regulators appear willing to overlook transgressions in order to continue green-lighting low-cost medicine. As a result, some American patients have gotten generic drugs with toxic impurities, unapproved ingredients, dangerous particulates or that are not bioequivalent. As the FDA investigator Peter Baker put it, if people actually understood, then nobody would take these drugs."", '14:46': ""Are there ways to solve this global problem? Yes, there are. Solutions begin with recognizing that our current honor system for drug regulation is a relic of a bygone age. Science evolves. Medicine evolves. The global economy evolves. Shouldn't regulation evolve with them? Only one approach can guarantee quality generics: rigorous oversight, including unannounced inspections and systematic testing of drugs. Rigorous oversight means that regulators don't just look at printouts of data that may or may not be genuine. Effective solutions also depend on giving the average patient more information. We know where our breakfast cereal and our running shoes are manufactured. Why is it different for generic drugs?"", '15:43': ""Patients can do something else. They can tell their elected officials and consumer organizations to speak up just as loudly to demand quality as they do to demand access. Consumer organizations can do their members a great service by testing and ranking generics, just like cars and washing machines. The big pharmacy chains owe it to the public to test the drugs they dispense. A trip to the pharmacy for affordable medicine shouldn't come with a hidden cost. Now is the time for all of us who care about patient safety to act on what we know."", '16:25': 'Thank you.', '16:27': '(Applause)'}"

We think we are resilient, he says, but if we are infected with hate and lack of knowledge, we could lose our democracy.",,,160428,2018-09-12T14:59:32+00:00,"['politics', 'government', 'journalism']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Nederlands']",Bob Woodward,"Journalist, author","{'0:00': 'said, ""Well, it\'s going to be expensive."" And Nixon said, ""Well, how much?"" And Dean said, ""Well, a million dollars."" Nixon: ""Oh, I know where I can get that."" In the White House. Level of criminality which is astonishing. Then the whole series of investigations, special prosecutor of Senate Watergate Committee, the impeachment investigation of Nixon, and he resigns in August, 1974. And what happened there, he lived for 20 more years, and the fifth war was the war against history, to say, ""Oh, no, Watergate was really not that important. I did not commit impeachable offenses,"" having surrogates go out and say, ""Well, there are unanswered questions about Watergate"" - which there are. But I think in a very important way, you look at Nixon and this record on the tapes - what he did is - the presidency is supposed to be something that can do good for a majority of people in the country. Listen to those tapes; time and time again, it\'s ""Let\'s use the power of the Presidency as an instrument of personal revenge. Let\'s get the IRS, the FBI, the CIA on Nixon\'s real or perceived opponents."" The dog - and this is ultimately, I think, the final corruption of Nixon in Watergate - the dog that doesn\'t bark on the tapes. No one, to my knowledge, ever says, What does the country need? What would be good for the people? It\'s all in this vicious way of let\'s screw somebody, let\'s help Nixon\'s career, let\'s prosecute the Vietnam War  so he\'ll get reelected even though - in one memo in my latest book, Nixon actually wrote out, which we didn\'t know at the time, just found this out last year, he said, ""Well, the bombing has achieved zilch, nothing."" And what did he do the year he was running for reelection? He increased the bombing, intensified it: 1.1 million tons of bombs in Southeast Asia. So the day Nixon resigned, he called his aides, friends, cabinet officers to the East Room of the White House and had his wife, two daughters, son-in-law standing there, and there was no script - it was Nixon raw - and he talked about his mother and his father, and he was sweating. It was just a lot of people worried that he was going to come unglued, because it was televised nationally. Then at the end, Nixon kind of waved his hand, ""Ah, here is why I called you all here."" And he said the following: ""Always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don\'t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself."" Now think of the wisdom in that: hate was the poison, hate was what drove him and his presidency, and at that moment he had to leave office, he understood the poison and how hate had destroyed him, had put the country on edge, and if there is anything to reflect on now if you look back, as we\'ve seen the current presidential election, on the surface and underneath, there is too much contempt, too much hate, and that, if you think about it, we need to know what\'s really going on. We don\'t know enough, and if we don\'t know what\'s going on, the judge who said it got it right: ""Democracies die in darkness."" And history proves that. And we think we\'re resilient - I think we are. We think we\'re strong. We think that we have a process that will protect us from that. But if we are infected with hate and infected with the lack of knowledge - who these people really are, what\'s inside, what\'s driving them - we could partake of losing our wonderful democracy.

(This virtual conversation, hosted by current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers and head of TED Chris Anderson, was recorded on May 27, 2020.)",00:24:15,24.25,159482,2020-06-03T19:56:23+00:00,"['public health', 'coronavirus', 'technology', 'pandemic', 'Google', 'health', 'health care']","['English', 'Português de Portugal', 'Ελληνικά']",Karen DeSalvo,"Chief Health Officer, Google","{'00:04': 'Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Before we really dive in to talking specifically about Google\'s work in the contact tracing space, let\'s first set up the relationship between public health and tech. You know, I think a lot of people, they hear ""Google,"" and they think of this big tech company. They think of a search engine. And there may be questions about why does Google have a chief health officer? So could you talk a little bit about your work and the work your team does?', '00:28': ""Karen DeSalvo: Yeah. Well, maybe I'm the embodiment of public health and tech coming together. My background is, I practiced medicine for 20 years, though a part of my work has always been in public health. In fact, my first job, putting myself through college, was working at the state laboratory in Massachusetts. As the story will go with Joia [Mukherjee] we're reconnected again, a Massachusetts theme. And I, across the journey of the work that I was doing for my patients to provide them information and the right care and meet them where they were medically, translated into the work that I did when I was the Health Commissioner in New Orleans and later when I had other roles in public health practice, that really is about thinking of people and community in the context in which they live and how we provide the best information, the best resources, the best services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, meet them where they are. And when the opportunity arose to join the team at Google, I was really thrilled, because one of the things that I have learned across my journey is that having the right information at the right time can make all the difference in the world. It can literally save lives. And billions of people come to Google every day asking for information, and so it is a tremendous opportunity to have that right information and those resources to people so that they can make good choices, so that they can have the right information, so that they can participate in their own health, but also, in the context of this historic pandemic, be a part of the broader health of the community, whether it's to flatten the curve or keep the curve flat as we go forward."", '02:07': ""WPR: And so it sounds like that there is this connection, then, between public health and what Google's work is in thinking about public education and providing information. And so could you talk a little bit about that link between public health and public education and Google?"", '02:23': 'KD: Definitely. You know, the essential public health services include communication and data, and these are two areas where tech in general, but certainly Google, has an opportunity to partner with the public health system and with the public for their health more broadly. You know, going back to the earlier days of this pandemic, towards the end of January, Google first leaned in to start to put information out to the public about how to find resources in their local community, from the CDC or from other authoritative resources. So on the search page, we put up ""knowledge panels,"" is the way that we describe it, and we did develop an SOS alert, which is something we\'ve done for other crises, and in this particular historic crisis, we wanted to be certain that when people went on to search, that there was authoritative information, which is always there but certainly very prominently displayed, and do that in partnership with public health authorities. So we began our journey really very much in an information way of making certain that people knew how to get the right information at the right time to save lives.', '03:37': ""I think the journey for us over the course of the last few months has been to continue to lean in on how we provide information in partnership with public health authorities in local areas, directing people in a certain state to their state's health department, helping people get information about testing. There's also been, though, a suite of resources that we wanted to provide to the health care community, whether that was for health care providers that may not have access to PPE, for example, we did a partnership with the CDC Foundation. Though the scale of the company and the opportunity for us to partner with public health around things like helping public health understand if their blunt policies around social distancing to flatten the curve were actually having an impact on behavior in the community. That's our community mobility reports. We were asked by public health agencies all across the world, including some of my colleagues here in the US, could we help them have a better evidence-based way to understand the policies around social distancing or shelter in place? Which I think we'll talk about more later. In addition to that sort of work, also been working to support public health in this really essential work they're doing for contact tracing, which is very human-resource intensive, very complex, incredibly important to keep the curve flat and prevent future outbreaks, and give time and space for health care and, importantly, science to do the work they need to do to create treatments and, very importantly, a vaccine. So that work around providing an additional set of digital tools, exposure notification for the contact tracing community, is one of the other areas where we've been supporting the public health."", '05:25': ""So we think, as we've thought about this pandemic, it's support the users, which is the consumer. There's also a health care system and a scientific community where we've been partnering. And then, of course, public health. And for me, I mean, Whitney, this is just a wonderful opportunity for Big Tech to come together with the public health infrastructure. Public health, as Joia was sort of articulating before, is often an unsung hero. It saves your life every day, but you didn't know it. And it is also a pretty under-resourced part of our health infrastructure, globally, but especially in the US. It's something I worked on a lot before I came to Google. And so the opportunity to partner and do everything that we can as a company and, in this case, with contact tracing in partnership with Apple to create a very privacy-promoting, useful, helpful product that is going to be a part of the bigger contact tracing is something that we feel really proud of and look forward to continuing to work with public health. In fact, we were on the phone this morning with a suite of public health groups from across the country, listening again to what would be helpful questions that they have. And as we think about rolling out the system, this is the way that we've been for the last many months at Google, and I'm just really ..."", '06:41': ""I landed at a place just a few months ago -- I just started at Google -- where we can have an impact on what people know all across the world. And I'll tell you, as a public health professional and as a doc, that is one of the most critical things. People need to have the right information so they can help navigate their health journey, but also especially in this pandemic because it's going to save lives."", '07:04': ""WPR: That's great. Thank you. So, to talk more about this contact tracing system and the exposure notification app, we've read so much about this. Could you describe this, a little bit about how the app works, what exactly are users seeing, what information is being collected? Just give us sort of a broad sense of what this app does."", '07:26': ""KD: Yeah. Let me just start by explaining what it is, and it's actually not even an app, it's just an API. It's a system that allows a public health agency to create an app, and only the API, this doorway to the phone system, is available to public health. So it's not designed for any other purpose than to support public health and the work that they're doing in COVID-19 in contact tracing."", '07:58': ""The second piece of this is that we wanted to build a system that was privacy-promoting, that really put the user first, gave them the opportunity to opt into the system and opt out whenever they wanted to do that, so they also have some control over how they're engaging and using their phone, basically, as a part of keeping the curve flat around the world."", '08:22': ""The system was developed in response to requests that we were getting about how could technology, particularly smartphones, be useful in contact tracing? And as we thought this through and talked with public health experts and academics and privacy experts, it was pretty clear that obviously contract tracing is a complex endeavor that does require human resources, because there's a lot of very particular things that you need to do in having conversations with people as part of contact tracing."", '08:56': 'On the other hand, there\'s some opportunity to better inform the contact investigators with things like, particularly, an exposure log. So one of the things that happens when the contact tracer calls you or visits you is they ask, ""Hey, in the last certain number of days,"" and in the case of COVID, it would be a couple days before symptoms developed, ""Hey, tell us the story of what you\'ve been involved in doing so that we can begin to think through where you might have been, to the grocery or to church or what other activities and with whom you might have been into contact."" There\'s some amount of recall bias in that for all us, like we forget where we might have been, and there\'s also an amount of anonymous contact. So there are times when we\'re out in the world, on a bus or in a store, and we may have come into prolonged and close contact with someone and wouldn\'t know who they were. And so the augmentation that the exposure notification system provides is designed to fill in those gaps and to expedite the notification to public health of who has a positive test, because the person would have notified, they trigger something that notifies public health, and then to fill in some of those gaps in the prior exposure.', '10:10': ""What it does not do is it does not use GPS or location to track people. So the system actually uses something different called Bluetooth Low Energy, which is privacy-preserving, it doesn't drain the battery and it makes it more also interoperable between both Apple and the Android system so it's more useful, not only in the US context, but globally. So we built this system in response to some requests to help augment the contact-tracing systems. We wanted to do it in a way that was user-controlled and privacy-preserving and had technological features that would allow public health to augment the exposure log in a way that would accelerate the work that they needed to get done to interrupt transmission -- keep the R naught less than one -- and do that in a way that we would also be able to partner with public health to think about risk scoring."", '11:04': ""We could talk more about any of these areas that you want, but I think maybe one of the most important things that I want to say, Whitney, is how grateful Apple and Google are -- I'll take a moment to speak for my colleagues at Apple -- to the great partnership from public health across the world and to academics and to others who have helped us think through how this can be, how the exposure notification system fits into the broader contact tracing portfolio, and how it does it in a way that really respects and protects privacy and also is useful to public health. We're still on this journey with them, and I really believe that we're going to be able to help, and I'm looking forward to being a part of the great work that public health's got to do on the front lines every day, been doing, frankly, but needs to be able to step up."", '11:52': ""WPR: That's great, and thank you for that really detailed explanation. And you know, we actually have Chris here with some questions from our community, so why don't we turn there really quickly."", '12:02': ""Chris Anderson: Yep. Questions pouring in, Karen. Here's one from Vishal Gurbuxani. Uh ... Gurbu -- I've pronounced that horribly wrong, but make up your own mind. Vishal, we'll connect later and you can tell me how to say that."", '12:15': ""KD: Fabulous last name. I love that. That's a Scrabble word."", '12:19': 'CA: ""Given where we are today, how should employees think about returning to work, with so many conflicting messages?""', '12:28': ""KD: This has been an important part of my work for the last few months. I joined Google in December, and all this started happening. The pandemic in the world first began in November but it got very hot in many parts of the world in the last few months, and we've been thinking a lot about how to protect Googlers but also protect the community. I've been talking a lot about what we've done externally. You know, internally, Google made a decision to go to work-from-home pretty early. We believed that we could. We believed that in all the places across the world where we have offices, that the more we could not only model but frankly just be a part of flattening the curve, that we would be good citizens. So we have been fairly ... I don't know if the right word is conservative or assertive, about it, because we really wanted to make sure that we were doing everything we could just to get people to shelter in place and socially distance. A lot of other companies have been doing the same, and I think the choices that people are making are going to be predicated on a whole array of factors: the rates of local transmission; governmental expectations; the ability to work from home; the individual characteristics of the workers themselves, how much risk they might have or how much risk it would be for them to bring that back into their household if they have people living in their household who would be at increased risk from morbidity, mortality, from suffering and death, from COVID. So these are individual and local considerations. I think for us as a company, we want to, as we've talked about publicly, we want to continue to be a part of the public health solution around social distancing, and so that for us means continuing to encourage work-from-home for our employees and really only be in if it's essential that people are in the workplace. And we've said publicly that we're going to be doing that for many months to come."", '14:28': ""Now, here's one thing I do want to say, which is, working from home has definite benefits, not only for the pandemic, but for some people, time for commute, etc. I think we're already learning there are some downsides, and there are generic downsides, even just not from work-from-home but school-from-home and just being at home, which is: social isolation is real. It causes depression. It has physical impacts on people's bodies; there's science around this. So as the world is weighing, even beyond the pandemic, when we've achieved herd immunity because we've been able to vaccinate the world with a functioning vaccine that creates immunity, I think probably a lot of workplaces are going to want to encourage work-from-home. But I just want us also to remember that part of humanity is community, and so we'll have to be thinking through how we balance those activities."", '15:30': 'CA: And, of course, there are huge swathes of the economy that can\'t work from home. We\'re a lucky few who can. And speaking of which, here\'s a question from Otho Kerr. ""Vulnerable communities seem to be receiving a disproportionate amount of misinformation. What is Google doing to help make sure these communities are receiving accurate news rather than fake news?""', '15:52': ""KD: You know, vulnerable communities is where I have spent most of my career focused. I think with many things that we've learned as a society in this pandemic were things that we, frankly, should have known. And before I get to the information, I'll just talk about access to services, which is to say, and to brag, I guess, on my hometown of New Orleans. One of the early things that New Orleans learned, or remembered or whatever, was that drive-through testing only works if you have a car. So you need walk-up testing, and it needs to be in the neighborhood. We need to meet people where they are, and it's thematic of all the work that we did after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was to build back a health care and public health infrastructure that was community-oriented, built with community not for community. Of all the many things that I really do hope last from this pandemic, one of them, though, is that we're being much more conscious of building with especially vulnerable communities and building out policies and processes that are as inclusive as possible."", '16:59': 'For Google information, we start with, on the search platform, for example, adding up knowledge panels, that we spend time making sure are linguistically and culturally appropriate. We tend to start globally, with global authoritative groups like the World Health Organization or the National Health Service or CDC, and then we begin to build down to more focused jurisdictions. On other platforms that we have like YouTube, we\'ve built out special channels where we do, because it\'s a platform and we can host content, we\'ve partnered with creatives -- we call them, I don\'t know, that\'s a new thing for me because I\'m a doctor -- but we\'ve partnered with creatives and influencers whose reach resonates with communities. We have had particular programming, for example, for seniors, African-Americans, so ""vulnerable"" takes on a lot of meaning for us globally and in the US context. Our work is not done, and we certainly every day are thinking about how we can do more to see that the information is accessible, accurate and also, frankly, interesting so that people want to engage.', '18:10': ""CA: Yeah. Alright, thank you Karen. I'll be back in a bit with some other questions."", '18:17': ""WPR: Thank you, Chris. And you know, and this is really wonderful talking about more broadly, where you see tech and public health going, and specifically, talking about these vulnerable communities. And I think one thing, even just beyond Google, it would be interesting to sort of hear your thoughts on where you see tech in general better serving public health, if there are spaces that you think, no matter which tech company we're talking about, we could all sort of come together to better serve the community. Do you have any thoughts on that?"", '18:51': 'KD: I could spend several hours talking to you about that, but maybe I\'ll just start by saying that I came to tech through the pathway of direct patient care and public health service in local community, and I ended up in a role in the federal government as the National Coordinator for Health IT, which, for my background, felt unusual to me, I\'m just being honest. And I thought, well, I\'m not really a tech person, but the secretary at the time said, ""That\'s exactly why we need you, because we need to apply tech."" And she had had the unfortunate experience of hearing me chirp about how public health needed more timely data to make better evidence-based policy on behalf of community and with community. This was a source of frustration for me as a local public health officer, that sometimes the data I was working on, though great, was stale by the time I needed to make decisions about chronic disease interventions, or mental health or even violence or intimate partner violence issues in my community. And so the desire to make data useful and accessible to support people in communities is something that\'s been burning in me for a long time, and what I have learned since I have been out in Silicon Valley is that that desire burns in the bellies of many people who work at Google and Apple and other companies, and it\'s been really wonderful to see, during this horrible time of the pandemic, the incredibly brilliant engineering and programming and other minds at a company like Google turn their attention on how can we partner with consumers and with public health to do the right thing, to bring the resources that we have to bear.', '20:43': 'And I said I could talk all day about it because I have many examples from the work that we have done at Google. Maybe I\'ll just point out a couple. One is to say that we very early on wanted to find a crisp way to help people understand what they could to protect themselves and their community, to flatten the curve, get the R naught less than one, and this ""Do the Five"" work that our teams, largely in marketing but then a lot of other people weighed in. It required massive amounts of talent to make that available on our landing page, on search, and then fold it out more broadly. We did that in partnership with the World Health Organization, then the CDC, then with countries all across the world to get simple messaging about staying home if you can and coughing into your elbow, washing your hands. These are basic public health messages that public health has been, frankly, even in flu season trying to get the word out, but it became, the resources at a company like a Google, and the reach to billions, it\'s a platform and a set of talents that aren\'t even the technical, computer vision kind of stuff that you would typically think about. Many other companies in Silicon Valley have weighed in in the same way.', '22:00': ""I think similarly, we've been thinking through how we can use tools like the community mobility reports. This is something, a business backer like we have for restaurants. The engineers and scientists said, what if we applied that to retail and grocery stores and transportation to get a snapshot in a community of whether people were using those areas less, whether people were adhering to local public health expectations and sheltering in place, and give that information not only to public health but to the public to help inspire them to do more for their community as well as for themselves. So there has been, I think what I'm trying to say, Whitney, is I think there's a natural marriage, and COVID has been an accelerant use case to demonstrate how that can work, and it is my expectation that companies like Google who, certainly for us it's in our DNA to be involved in health, will want to continue working on this going forward, because it's really not just good for what we need to get done in this pandemic, but public health and prevention are part and parcel of how we create opportunity and equity in all communities across the world. So I'm passionate about the work of public health and very passionate about partnership. Can I just say one more thing?"", '23:26': 'WPR: Absolutely.', '23:27': ""KD: Which is to say that one of the first things that I did before the pandemic started, I had just started in December, and then in January, I did a listening session with consumers about what they wanted, and they said something kind of similar to what you said, which I just want to call out, and that is, they wanted partnership, they wanted transparency and they really felt like there was quite a lot that tech in general could do to help them on their health journey. But their ask was that we did it in a transparent way and we did it in a partnered way with them. And so as we move out of the pandemic, and we're thinking more about consumers, I want to carry some of this spirit also of prevention and helpfulness and transparency into the work that we're going to continue to do for people every day.""}"

In minutes they stirred the camp into a panic, stole about 70 horses, and disappeared.', '00:27': 'Led by a young chief named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, or Comanches, and the United States forces sent to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel drew near his targets, they disappeared without a trace into the vast plains.', '01:05': 'The Comanches had controlled this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie faced off.', '02:03': 'Born around 1848, Quanah was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada.', '02:32': 'In the years that followed, Quanah proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma.', '03:39': 'As hunter-gatherers, they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised rations and supplies, but what they provided was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power compared to others who had been on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income for the Comanches on the reservation.', '04:27': 'As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders had supported him to lead them against the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment.', '05:07': 'Quanah acted in Hollywood movies and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both died shortly after their capture.', '05:34': 'Quanah adapted again and again— to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official in the tribe, recognizing him as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens and countless descendants.'}"

They can make us swell with pride, burn with hatred -- and even inspire people to die or kill in their name, says vexillologist Michael Green. Take a brief walk through history as Green explores the symbolic fervor behind flags that unify and divide, inviting us to imagine a future where we can come together under one collective identity: humanity.",00:15:10,15.166666666666666,155767,2020-06-09T15:27:15+00:00,"['history', 'identity', 'design', 'product design', 'TEDx', 'global commons']","['Català', 'English', 'Español', 'Hrvatski', 'Српски, Srpski', 'български', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)']",Michael Green,Vexillologist,"{'00:05': 'In 1989, an artist by the name of Dread Scott, who has also graced the TED stage, created a piece of art in Chicago, where he simply placed an American flag on the ground and then invited you the viewer to go and stand on that flag and record how it felt in a journal. And to me, one of the most powerful things written in that journal, in essence, says, ""Why are we so OK with homeless people, with human beings laying on the ground, but not flags?""', '00:41': ""And to some of you, this piece of art is quite disturbing. And that's kind of the point of this talk -- not to upset you or to make you mad but to prove to you that flags have an incredible power, and that even if you think you don't care about flags, you do. You know you do. Alright."", '01:01': ""By the end of it, I hope that you're inspired to go out and harness this power of flags and fight for a better world. But before we get there, we're going to start on the opposite end of the spectrum. And before I show you the next stuff, I need to say that anything I show here is not an endorsement, it's usually quite the opposite. But more than anything, what I want to do is create a space here where we can look at these flags, these designs, and examine how they make us feel. We're going to talk about our emotions. Is that OK with everybody?"", '01:34': 'OK. Are you ready for your first flag?', '01:39': ""Cool, we'll start with an easy one. That was a joke. (Laughs) So, some of you may be a little bit uneasy sitting in a room with this. I'm certainly feeling uneasy standing in front of it. Some of you may be feeling a little bit of pride. And that's understandable. This is Texas. This is not a rare sight, is it?"", '02:00': ""But let's start with the facts. So this is not the Confederate flag. OK? This is the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee. So next time someone tells you that this is their heritage, unless their family fought for that very specific militia, they're wrong, alright? And you have a flag expert's permission to tell them so. This flag rose into prominence during the mid-1950s and '60s as a response to the growing Civil Rights Movement. And then of course today, it has come to represent the Confederacy to most of us. But I shouldn't have to remind you what the Confederacy is. It was a rogue nation that rose up against the United States, waged war on the US, and at one point in time, this was one of the most un-American things you could have. But yet, this flag is protected by the same laws that protect the United States flag in the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana."", '03:06': ""But let's pick on Georgia for a second, shall we? So in 1956, a few years after desegregation was mandated in public schools, Georgia changed their state flag to this. I think everyone watching can agree that this was not meant to be a flag that every Georgian was proud to fly outside of their home, was it? No. Just like all of the Confederate statues erected in the mid-1950s and '60s, this was meant to be a symbol of who was in charge and who was not. This remained the flag of Georgia until the year 2001, and in that year, they changed their flag to this. Now, as a flag expert, I can tell you: this is officially ugly. OK? It's OK to laugh at this flag. It's ugly, and because it's so ugly, that's one of the reasons they changed it just two years later. They had a referendum where they got to choose between that thing and then what is now the current flag of Georgia."", '04:08': 'Now some of you might be wondering, ""Wait a second, Michael -- if that before wasn\'t the Confederate flag, what was the Confederate flag?"" Georgia flies the first flag of the Confederate States of America to this day. They just slapped their state seal on it.', '04:27': ""Well, let's go back to our emotions for a second. That didn't punch you in the gut as much as the other one did, did it? Right? And that's why I love flags. They are the simplest pieces of design, usually just two or three colors, just some bars or stripes. But yet, they can invoke the deepest emotions within us. They'll make us swell with pride or burn with hatred. We will die for a flag or even kill for one."", '05:01': 'One of my favorite designers, his name is Wally Olins, they call him the father of nation branding, and he\'s quoted as saying that ""Everyone wants to belong, and then they want to display symbols of belonging."" And it\'s crazy that these pieces of cloth that are just sewn together or dyed come to be such a sacred item, and that\'s because they become parts of our identity. They are powerful tools to unify but equally powerful tools to divide.', '05:34': ""You ready for the next flag? Right. Take a moment. Really examine how you felt when this hit the screen. I'm going to change the slide pretty quickly so you don't take pictures of me in front of this one."", '05:49': '(Laughter)', '05:50': 'Alright?', '05:51': 'So Germany after World War I, it was in a pretty bad state, and a young Adolf Hitler had a lot of -- let\'s call them -- ""ideas,"" of how Germany got to where they\'d gotten and how to get them out. He spent entire chapters in his book ""Mein Kampf,"" which I don\'t recommend reading, about how Germany lost World War I partially because the British had better graphic design and better propaganda.', '06:19': 'So, as the Nazi Party rose, Hitler created one of the thickest brand guides I\'ve ever seen. It\'s thicker than most company brand guides today, and in it, he details titles and uniforms and lots and lots of flags. Hitler knew the power of flags. He says in ""Mein Kampf,"" ""The new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster, [because] in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement."" He was an artist, after all. He knew the power of visual identity and uniforms could reignite the German identity. And to millions of Germans, this was a welcome sign. But of course, this was also a mark of death to others.', '07:09': ""We don't often think of flags as weapons, but like the Confederate battle flag, the Germans used their flag to make an out-group feel unwelcome and less than. You see, when you create a flag, you immediately do two things: you create an in-group, a group that's meant to be represented by the symbol, but then, inevitably, you create an out-group. And usually, that's subtle. It's a byproduct. It's usually not the intent. But the Germans were very clear as to who was represented by the swastika and who was not."", '07:44': ""In 1935, Jewish people were banned from flying German flags. And in this way, the Germans, maybe more than any other time in history, used the dual power of flags to unite but also to divide. Flags were used as identity weapons. And now, in 2019, the Nazi flag is banned from being flown by anyone in Germany and anyone in Austria, in Hungary, in Russia and in Ukraine. Think about that. It's a piece of cloth, but it's banned. On its face, that sounds crazy. But I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that it's probably good. Sounds a lot like a weapon."", '08:30': 'As a vexillologist, sometimes the most interesting thing about a flag is not so much its design, but it\'s those laws around the flag. For instance, in India, to create an Indian flag, you must use a hand-spun cloth named ""khadi."" If you make a flag out of anything else, you could go to jail for up to three years. It\'s crazy. Here in Texas, we\'ve all heard that the Texas flag is the only state flag that can fly at the same height as the US, flag, right? Because we were a nation before we were a state. Who here has heard that? Yeah. Well, I\'m here to tell you that is completely false. OK? First of all, we were not the only state that was a nation before joining up. And secondly, all state flags can fly at the same height as the US flag according to the US flag code.', '09:26': ""And I don't have to ask you how you feel about this one, right? Most of us grew up pledging allegiance to this every morning, knowing we should never let it touch the ground, etc. We take our flag code very seriously here in the United States."", '09:41': 'You remember, recently some NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. It was a big controversy. They were breaking the flag code. It states during the national anthem, stand at attention, hand at the heart, etc. But what was fascinating to me as a vexillologist is that I didn\'t see anyone getting upset when something like this happens. The flag code says, ""The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free."" So sometimes during the exact same national anthem, this was being done, and no one\'s upset. Or this. This happens all the time. The flag code is clear: ""No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or on an athletic uniform."" This is Texas A&amp;M baseball, not to get them in trouble, but this happens all the time, especially in November. I\'m sure, I can almost guarantee when you leave here tonight, you will see on the back of someone\'s car or truck a black and white American flag with a blue stripe, a thin blue line, right? Blue Lives Matter. That breaks the flag code in multiple ways.', '10:43': 'But all of these things are done with the best intent. No one\'s here to argue that. But of course they break a section of the flag code titled ""Respect for the Flag,"" so by putting this on your uniform, you are legally disrespecting the flag. And what I find interesting is that those NFL players kneeling during the anthem and the people who would put Blue Lives Matters stickers on their car are both on the opposite end of a very big issue, but they\'re both breaking the exact same law, a law that is 100 percent unenforceable. In fact, it was Dread Scott\'s piece of art in 1989 that led the Supreme Court to rule that the flag code is just a guideline. You cannot be prosecuted for breaking the flag code. You cannot be forced to be patriotic.', '11:36': ""So why, then, have all of these little laws around how we use our flag if you can't enforce them? And that's because a nation is a fragile collective idea. It only exists in our minds. Can I see this? Thank you. Sometimes a flag is the only tangible symbol of that idea. Right? Our unity is sometimes only held together by literal threads. And that's powerful. The flag code is meant to preserve and protect that fragile idea, while also protecting your right to break it. And that's what's special about the United States, right?"", '12:22': ""And that's what's unique about our flag. Our flag is amazing. It has changed more than any other flag in the world. It's the flag code that says when a new state is created, a star shall be added to the union of the flag, and such addition shall take place on the fourth day of July. Our flag is unique because it is meant to grow as we grow. By design and by law, it is meant to change with us. It's a living symbol of our individuality, our diversity in the stars and our unity. We have a gift in the United States to have a flag that is inclusive. If the Nazi flag was an identity weapon, the United States flag, by design alone, stands in direct contrast. And I have to say, as a vexillologist in 2019, using this flag as an identity weapon against anyone disrespects it far more than letting it touch the ground or any one of the other little laws that we break every day. Right?"", '13:30': 'This flag is a symbol of our unity. We should never use this as a weapon against someone else. I resonate so deeply with the person who wrote in Dread Scott\'s journal, ""We should never value the symbol over the thing that it symbolizes. We should never value a piece of cloth over a human life."" And if you\'re ever going to use a piece of cloth as a weapon, you should never use this one, not when it has always had room for more stars.', '14:01': ""Hopefully by now, you've felt the power of flags, and you can see what they can do. So what if we harnessed that power, and we used it to fight for something greater? This is the flag of Earth, designed by Oskar Pernefeldt of Sweden. Just imagine with me for a second: What if we celebrated our humanity as much if not more than we celebrate our nationalities? As we become a spacefaring civilization and we go off into the stars, what do our nations mean anyway when you're standing on the surface of Mars or any other planet? And then of course, back here on Earth, as our planet is facing a climate crisis, as our climate could be unlivable in our children or grandchildren's lifetime, I believe we need a strong symbol, a flag, to unite us to fight, not just as nations, but as a species."", '15:05': 'Thank you.', '15:07': '(Applause)'}"

Here the last artifact— the Node of Memory— is suspended within a force field and powering a supercomputer.', '00:58': 'Ethic is about to deactivate the force field when Lemma stops her. She explains, a decade ago, she was assigned a research task: to use the world machine to create something that would make everyone happy. After many failed attempts, Lemma discovered a compound that, when ingested, made people motivated, happy, creative, loving… in short, their best selves. It was rushed into production. Soon, the entire nation’s food supply came from Huxenborg, with the compound mixed in. The first year was paradise. The second, not so much. Side-effects began to emerge: memory-loss, listlessness, and self-absorption. In the third year, the government dissolved, leaving the robots running everything in a self-sustaining loop. By this point things were too far gone for Lemma to reverse. People had become dependent on the compound, and the few who refused it formed a resistance to try to fix things. It took 10 years for Lemma to find a cure. This factory contains everything she’ll need to make it, but the second they take the Node of Memory, the security system will alert the robots, and they’ll have to run. If, instead, they first reconfigure the factory to manufacture the cure, the people can be saved.', '02:22': 'Lemma has the whole factory redesign planned out. The problem is… it’s a little hard to read. Her schematic shows all the steps in the manufacturing process needed to make the cure. An arrow from “add nitric acid” to “shake vigorously” means that the acid addition has to happen before shaking. If a single step is performed out of order, the cure won’t work, or worse. There aren’t any circular references, where step A requires step B and step B eventually requires step A.', '03:10': 'Here’s where Ethic and Hedge come in. Lemma needs Hedge to translate the tangled diagram into a sequence of steps. That’ll be the order that things happen in the factory. Once input into the central computer, the factory will reassemble itself as instructed.', '03:28': 'Hedge’s ability to store information in a table will help here. So how does Ethic program Hedge to turn out a correct sequence that can reconfigure the factory?', '03:38': 'Pause now to figure it out yourself.

Given this diagram, it’s clear to start with getting a bowl, since no arrows point to it. How might you mark up the diagram to figure out what to do next?', '04:05': 'Pause now to figure it out yourself. Solution in 3 Solution in 2 Solution in 1', '04:10': 'Diagrams like the one Lemma has drawn are called directed acyclic graphs. A graph is a representation of data that shows different elements and how they’re related to each other. Directed means that direction matters— as indicated by the arrows. Here A leads to B, but B doesn’t lead to A. And acyclic means that there aren’t any loops. Which is fortunate, because if there were, this problem wouldn’t be solvable.', '04:42': 'There’s a simple way to navigate the graph as a human: start with a step that doesn’t have any arrows pointing to it. Once you do that, cross out that step and all arrows leading from it. Choose another step with no arrows pointing to it, and repeat until you’ve hit every step.', '05:01': 'There are two things here that are tricky to translate for a robot. First, how do you keep track of the information? And second, what do you do if there are multiple options at the same time?', '05:13': 'For the first challenge, a convenient way for machines to store information is in a table. In this case, you can have Hedge list every step in the headers of both the rows and columns. Then he can go through the rows one at a time. On the schematic, what points to mix? Both shake and titrate. So Hedge should make a mark in both of their columns. He can do the same for every row, one at a time, to make a table like this. Of course the full table will be much bigger.', '05:46': 'Like a human, Hedge will also want to start from one of the steps that has no arrows pointing to it— which is the same as having no marks in its row. If there’s more than one, a convenient way to choose is to pick the one that’s alphabetically earliest, though other selection methods can work just as well.', '06:06': 'Next, Hedge can add that step to his running-order list, delete its entire column from the table— thus removing all the times it was a dependency–– and loop back to the start. Because there are no circular references in the graph, each time we get here there’ll be at least one step with no remaining dependencies. Hedge can add the alphabetically earliest to his running-order list, remove it from the table, and loop back to the start again.', '06:37': 'So now we have a working loop, and it’ll run through all the elements in our table until none are left.', '06:44': 'Hedge drifts back and forth over the schematics, and soon he starts spitting out instructions, which Ethic uses to configure the assembly lines. With the three working together, they churn out thousands of doses of the cure in no time. Ethic finally plucks the Node of Memory from its holding field and trips the alarm. Within seconds bots are everywhere.', '08:08': 'As Ethic falls in shock, the Node restores not only her own memories, but reveals the last, missing pieces of the puzzle.', '08:17': 'Ethic built Hedge with a singular purpose: to construct a maze that would protect the world machine from a corrupt government. But in her haste, she made a critical mistake. She forgot to set the condition that would end the loop which told Hedge how large the maze should be. So Hedge built and built until he could build no longer.', '08:39': 'And then he was conflicted. He had to build a maze. But he couldn’t build further without hurting people or flying over the Bradbarrier, both forbidden by his programming. So he wandered the land and searched for a solution, until he happened upon the Node of Power, the Node of Creation, and the Node of Memory. He recognized their true, collective power to grant self-awareness to those who lack it. With all three he’d be able to change his programming and fulfill his drive to transform the entire world into a giant maze. It wouldn’t be easy: the Nodes had safeguards to prevent robots from taking and using them. But if Hedge could find the right human and manipulate her with the promise of a heroic quest… well that would be a different story. A very different story.'}"

Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago. But, to understand why, we need to understand spin. In physics, we talk about two types of motion. The first is straight-line motion. You push on something, and it moves forward. The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place. An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop. The same thing happens when you get something spinning. It will keep on spinning until something stops it. But the spin can speed up. If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed. But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next. She spins faster. This is called the conservation of angular momentum. Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis. If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller. Arms closer, spin faster. Arms farther, spin slower. Spin causes other effects, too. If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path. It doesn\'t actually curve, though. It really goes in a straight line. You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve. We call this the coriolis effect. Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment. We call it the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis once each day. But why does the Earth spin? Now, that\'s a story that starts billions of years ago. A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together. Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin. And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster. And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin. And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day. And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather. The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it\'s warmer at the equator than at the poles. The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move. They make the wind blow. But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect. If there\'s a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain. But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin. With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane. So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth\'s spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago. You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that\'s older than rocks, that\'s older than the Earth itself.'}"

In this eye-opening talk, animal advocate and social scientist Jacy Reese makes a compelling argument as to why (and how) we should relegate the factory farming of animals to history's scrap pile.",,,141001,2018-03-14T14:49:48+00:00,"['global issues', 'science', 'food', 'health', 'animals', 'agriculture']","['English', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands']",Jacy Reese,,"{'0:00': 'one we can tackle with the tools of Effective Altruism ... their growing mindset in charity, business and politics of using evidence-based research to find and implement the most effective solutions to the world\'s biggest problems. The most powerful tool we have is innovation. The amazing thing is that we don\'t have to give up meat, dairy, or eggs to end animal farming. Think about it: what\'s meat? It\'s fat, protein, water and trace minerals. All these ingredients are readily available in the plant kingdom. They\'re just not assembled in the architecture of meat. That\'s what a cow does. But a cow also does a lot of stuff we don\'t need. She grows hair, teeth, bones. She walks around; she breathes, thinks, and feels. These extra processes mean that for every 10 calories of plant-based food we feed a farmed animal, we get around 1 calorie of meat in return. Even with the nutrient animal products are most known for, protein, for every 10 grams of plant-based, we get, at most, 2 grams of animal-based. So what if we assembled these ingredients ourselves with a more efficient, ethical process? That\'s the approach of companies like Beyond Meat, Hungry Planet, and Impossible Foods. They\'ve already succeeded in making a beef burger made from plants. Many consumers can\'t even tell the difference. Today, they\'re just perfecting that product and scaling up the process to lower costs and widen distribution. In fact, the Beyond Burger pictured here is already available in Mississippi. But let\'s be cautious. What if consumers are really picky? What if they don\'t just want something that tastes like animal meat, but something that is actually made from animal cells? Well, there\'s good news. Scientists and chefs have been working on so-called clean meat, real meat made without the food safety and ethical cost of animal slaughter. To do this, they take a small sample of cells from a living animal and place those cells in a cultivator, which looks like one of the big tanks at a beer brewery. Inside, the cells mix with the nutrients they need to grow in the same process that happens inside an animal\'s body, and voila! You can have your cow and eat beef too. (Laughter) But you might be thinking, ""Not all beneficial technologies are widely adopted, right? So what if something goes wrong? What if the technology is fully developed, but perceived as just another food for vegetarians? Or what if an irresponsible company lets their product get contaminated, leading to a cascade of negative press that cripples the industry?"" With conventional meat, we see contamination scandals all the time, but for a young industry like clean meat, it could be fatal. It\'s like self-driving cars, where the industry needs to be especially careful about collisions, despite having an overall better safety record. So what social change will we see on our way to an animal-free food system? The biggest one is a shift beyond the individual and towards institutional change. Like I said earlier, advocates have thus far focused heavily on one-by-one diet change, but I believe we\'ll see the biggest changes happen with changes to institutions like businesses, government, nonprofits and society as a whole. There\'s a lot of evidence that this strategy is more effective. Last year, I was at a protest, calling for a restaurant chain to reform its animal-welfare policies, just basic stuff, like choosing healthier breeds of chickens, or having windows in the chicken sheds. A pedestrian walked up and thanked me profusely for helping these poor animals. I told him he was welcome to join us, as bystanders sometimes do, and he said, ""Oh no, no, no. I can\'t. I\'m not a vegetarian."" I insisted that he was welcome to join us without being vegetarian. We were just calling for better treatment for these animals. But he was unconvinced. He saw vegetarianism as a prerequisite to helping farmed animals because advocates have conflated the two for so long. If we had, instead, used an institutional framing, that bystander might have joined us and maybe become vegetarian along the way. This strategy also helps people avoid what psychologists call ""the collapse of compassion,"" the feeling of apathy that comes when we encounter a big problem without clearly seeing the big solution. The institutional framing puts that solution, changing society as a whole, front and center in our messaging. This strategy is also well-evidenced by historical social movements, which is what I spend most of my time researching. Virtually no movements - from environmentalism, children\'s rights, antislavery, feminism to antiwar movements - have succeeded with the heavy, individual focus that we see in the farmed-animal movement. Consumer advocacy like boycotts have succeeded when used as tools for institutional change, but failed when treated as an end goal. We need to learn from the past. The second big change is a shift beyond opposition to factory farming alone and towards opposition to animal farming as whole. There\'s a lot of evidence for this strategy too. First, numerous investigations have shown that so-called humane farms are rarely humane in practice. The most picturesque farm I\'ve ever been on was an award-winning California egg farm. But because of the farm\'s natural and organic policies, they didn\'t vaccinate the birds or give them antibiotics, like factory farms do. This led to atrocious health. I saw many cases of Marek\'s, a highly contagious disease that often leads to blindness and missing eyes; fluid belly, some birds with over a pound of fluid buildup inside their less than five-pound bodies; fungal infections; lice on almost all of them; and many birds crippled by eggs that had gotten stuck inside them on the way out. I\'ve been dismayed that the reality of these farms is nearly as bad as factory farming. While reduction in suffering is something we should applaud, and it can be a step towards abolition, the unmitigated suffering is still a moral catastrophe. Second, simply the idea that there are humane ways to raise and kill animals for food is a huge roadblock, even if you just oppose factory farming. Seventy-five percent of people think they usually eat meat from animals who were treated humanely, but as we saw earlier, less than 1% of farmed animals actually live on non-factory farms. That\'s crazy, right? Why are consumers so confused? Well, when we eat animals, there\'s a cognitive dissonance that claws at us because deep down, we care about animals too. What seems to happen is that our subconscious protects us from this dissonance by creating a psychological refuge. It tells us that, actually, everything is okay, that farmed animals are treated well, even when the facts point in the opposite direction. This mistaken belief protects us from the conflict between our values and our behavior. And the misleading labels on animal products, like pictures of green pastures on cartons of factory farm eggs, exacerbate this issue. Finally, these farms are just too expensive to feed this hungry planet. So-called humane animal products are already several times the normal price. Many of us just can\'t afford that. And the demand on natural resources is just too much for this planet to bear, especially when we can get the same foods from more sustainable sources. Fortunately, the future is bright. Today, we\'re at an inflection point, where the moral reasons to change our food system are very compelling. Technology is on its way and excellent alternatives are already here, and advocates are wising up to more impactful strategies. It\'s incredibly empowering to have this wealth of evidence available, from history, psychology and elsewhere, to analyze using the effective altruism perspective. Ultimately, that evidence suggests that we can achieve a truly humane food system if we strive towards the end of animal farming. And public opinion is already a lot further along on this than you might think. Forty-seven percent of US adults already say they support a ban on slaughter houses. As we transition, as we align our food system with our values, we\'re going to see a sweeping change in the relationship between humans and the other inhabitants of this planet. Once we\'re no longer eating animals three times a day, we\'ll see a huge relief in cognitive dissonance that frees our conscience to expand our moral circle to not just farmed animals, but other populations like dogs and cats in shelters, animals used in circuses and entertainment, and the vast number of wild animals who also need our help. Today, we\'re laying the foundation for future social movements just as social movements of the past laid the bedrock we now stand on. Richard Branson predicted that the food system will be animal-free in just 30 years. It might take a little longer than that, but it\'s clear that huge change is coming. You can stand on the right side of history and play a role in this exciting movement, whether it\'s by starting a business like a local restaurant or a clean-meat company, becoming an activist, making a donation, or simply sharing content on social media. You can, of course, also participate as a conscious consumer, but keep in mind that your own diet choice is just one of many ways to have an impact. This is a time of unbridled excitement and opportunity, as we look ahead at one of the next great social movements. Humanity\'s moral circle will continue to expand, but only if people like you and me take hold. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

Euclid is known as the author of a singularly influential work known as ""Elements."" You think your math book is long? Euclid\'s ""Elements"" is 13 volumes full of just geometry. In ""Elements,"" Euclid structured and supplemented the work of many mathematicians that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions, and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however, is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded in a very convoluted way. Euclid\'s version states that, ""If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel."" Wow, that is a mouthful! Here\'s the simpler, more familiar version: ""In a plane, through any point not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn that\'s parallel to the original one."" Many mathematicians over the centuries tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four, but weren\'t able to do so. In the process, they began looking at what would happen logically if the fifth postulate were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss, and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known as non-Euclidean geometries. We\'ll leave the details of these different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us the entire story in ""Elements,"" and merely described one possible way to look at the universe. It all depends on the context of what you\'re looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether Euclid had any inkling of the existence of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it\'s hard to believe he had no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him to flush out the details. If so, he\'s probably pleased. These discoveries could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside of what they\'ve been taught. We, too, must be willing at times to put aside our preconceived notions and physical experiences and look at the larger picture, or we risk not seeing the rest of the story.'}"

You know, recently there have been lots of commendable actions taken by your country when we think about climate. Chile recently committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, the first in the Americas to do this, and that's especially notable when you think about how much of Chile's economy really depends on carbon emissions: mining and agriculture and spaces like that.

This hasn't happened, so the thing is, the reason why Chile has a sort of vision towards mitigation that's ambitious is that we see that there's a big economic benefit. We have seen, we've witnessed, what the renewable energy sector has been able to do for investment, for lowering energy costs. And so therefore to reach this goal, we will inevitably expand to 100 percent renewable, but we'll also transform our industry, which is heavy on fossil fuels, towards low emissions, with the hydrogen economy kicking in, with a recently launched committee that I formed, that Minister Jobet, the Minister of Energy, set up.

The population, public unrest, set up almost 6,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants to never be built. And when the government, Michelle Bachelet's government came in, we pulled the plug on the HidroAysén project, which is a big hydro project in the Patagonia. And both of these conditions enabled an opportunity for renewable energy to set in. We put in carbon taxes, we put in environmental regulations, and we set up an energy strategy that we did, building on discussing and looking at the data, in which we thought that the 70 percent renewable energy by 2050 was going to be a target that we could agree on. This target has been long surpassed. Now we're thinking of reaching that same goal by 2030."", '03:57': ""WPR: And what you were saying about social protests, that's something that a lot of people maybe have been following news of what's going in Chile are familiar with recent social protests, and I think I'm curious about how you see that factoring in to climate action moving forward. How might these social protests play a role in what climate action you see? And, really, how is it possible for Chile to be a leader in climate action while also struggling with some of these social issues?"", '04:28': ""MM: Well, the social issues, which are very profound and important to address, caused, for example, COP25 to not be able to be held in Santiago and to go to Madrid. And this also shifted a whole bunch of the discussions and announcements that weren't done and we were expecting to have. But regardless of this, the fact that we have this commitment from the government today shows that there's a resolution to continue forward. But really, the economic model of Chile was brought into question, because the environmental issues, for example, are quite widespread, and many times you have large coal-fired power plants being situated where people live and with higher mortality rates. Somebody who lives where a power plant is installed has twice the rate of death in comparison to other people in Chile. So the model of having many people be impacted for the benefit of few is something that caused and triggered the social unrest. And it goes into the economic model itself of extracting, polluting, impacting communities that may not see the benefits of these economic activities. So while we've done a lot -- we've come a long way, for example, in securing a very emblematic agreement to phase out coal-fired power plants -- many people feel that this wasn't done fast enough and want this action to be brought faster."", '05:54': 'WPR: And it sounds like having people be the voice and the engine behind making that happen has really been part of this historical thread with climate action in Chile and seems like it would really lead things moving into the future.', '06:11': 'MM: No, definitely, and we will continue. Yes, go ahead. Sorry.', '06:15': 'WPR: Go ahead. Please go ahead. We have a little bit of a delay.', '06:19': ""MM: Going forward, we're going to be ... Starting out, we are doing well, but I think we need to double down on our commitments. So even though we have ministries involved, we have civil society involved, we need to bring in the mainstream industry. I think, for example, the mining sector has a great opportunity to be the solution for the environmental issues, because we provide the copper, the cobalt, the lithium that are required for solar PV panels, for battery storage. But we need to do this in a clean manner. I think that's the biggest challenge we're going to have in the next 20 years ahead."", '06:55': ""WPR: And sort of pivoting to the pandemic and to thinking about what's going on right now, the entire world has obviously been devastated by this crisis. What have been some of the unique challenges that Chile has faced during this pandemic?"", '07:10': ""MM: Well, definitely, as anybody, we are always struggling within taking actions today to prevent a deeper impact in the future. And we started off pretty well. We shut off schools. We shut off different cities and had a quarantine. But we gave the wrong signals to people and we didn't have a consistent effort, and this has brought us to have the highest infection rates per capita in the world these days. So this goes to show that -- the same parallels with climate change. We need to take action now to prevent deeper impact later. And I think we need to take the lesson of this to continue with an effort, because one thing is to announce an ambitious NDC. Another thing is to invest and do the regulations that you require to turn this into reality. But there are some things that are interesting. The pollution in Santiago, which is one of the most polluted capitals historically in Latin America, has dropped substantially. The car-related emissions are down almost 80 to 90 percent, which is pretty substantive. And we look at the example of what's going on. Harvard University showed a study in which they showed higher mortality rates for more polluted cities. And this is also the case in Chile. For every microgram of pollution, PM2.5, there is an increase of the fatality rate of nine percent. But the thing is, we could also look back at what we've achieved up to now. Had we not taken measures to clean the air, as we've done in Chile these last 20 years, we would be talking about five times more people would have died from COVID. We have around 800 people that have died due to COVID directly, but this would have been much higher had we not taken action. And in fact, due to the lower pollution, if we estimate and predict this to the rest of the year, we will have saved as many lives reducing the pollution as we have lost in COVID, showing that there's a pandemic that we also need to address, which is the crisis on air pollution that suffocates many cities in the world."", '09:11': ""WPR: And it seems like that's probably something that we're seeing in other areas around the world. As you're suggesting, air pollution is a problem everywhere. And I'm curious also how these challenges that you've mentioned, and maybe others, might hinder or help some of this progress that you're hoping to make towards climate action. How do you see this factoring in to some of the decisions that might be made going forward in Chile and beyond?"", '09:40': ""MM: OK, so we have a higher fatality rate and more polluted cities, and we have a climate action to carry out. This is going to be a decisive decade, in which we need to lay the groundwork for our lower-emissions strategies. So whatever we do today cannot lock us in to an incompatible climate future. We need to lay the groundwork for this low-emissions transition. So therefore, our green recovery efforts need to be done, as Kristalina [Georgieva] spoke last week, has to be related to a green recovery that creates jobs immediately, that addresses the poverty issues that we have on energy today in southern Chile, and we need to use this for expanding renewable energy and expanding the successful efforts that we've done on electromobility. Today, we have the largest fleet of electric buses outside of China, but we could actually make this go even bigger, because we've seen that the reductions in cost have been almost 70 percent in comparison to diesel buses. So we should use this opportunity to expand."", '10:40': ""And multiple stakeholders are working. We're working together to call on the government to do a green recovery, to use the green bonds that we've already issued and under which we've gotten really low rates for interest rates, to do and fund cleaning the air, cleaning the transportation and laying the groundwork for a cleaner tomorrow in the mining sector, which is our biggest challenge going forward."", '11:07': ""WPR: And then as far as the way that you think about and conceptualize climate action, have you personally had any changes to your thinking, just as a result of what you're seeing through this pandemic?"", '11:21': ""MM: Yeah, I think we start looking around, everybody had to struggle and find that we could do much more with less, and keeping a full economy that requires you to buy an extra t-shirt that you don't need, the fact that we're using three times more clothes than we were maybe 20 years ago shows that we are blowing up an economy that requires us to destroy the environment, in a way, to continue forward. And the food system is going to be probably our biggest challenge, and even though I've been working with electric buses and electromobility and just the more conventional mitigation, I think our biggest cultural challenge will be to talk about how our food decisions impact the way that we will have a future."", '12:12': '""Nature"" just put out a report that showed something that when we were in the government, we had talked about. When Chile was good in soccer, we started going deeper into the wintertime contests, and we started winning games. But to win those games, we started doing a lot of barbecues, and the paper that came out showed something that, when we explained this to people, that you guys are messing up the air with barbecues, people thought we were crazy. Well, the ""Nature"" report now shows that we actually fouled the air and destroyed the air, annihilated the air, because we wanted to celebrate the soccer. And we set this up to people, and people thought we were crazy. Now people acknowledge the fact that the basic things that you could do, such as the way that you choose how to cook, could actually impact your air. So I think going forward these cultural challenges that we need to do, we need to tackle them head-on. We should need to show the evidence. Otherwise, we\'re just going to be ignoring problems and letting them perpetuate for the future.', '13:15': 'WPR: And, you know, for nations who have not really prioritized climate in the same way that Chile has, are there lessons that you think can be learned from some of the choices that Chile has made in recent years that other nations can apply, and how could folks in other countries implement some of these strategies that you implemented in Chile?', '13:36': 'MM: So, many people in the US and across the world know about the Chilean sea bass. The Chilean sea bass was overfished and almost collapsed. One of the things that we did under the support from ""National Geographic"" and with the leadership of President Bachelet was to expand marine protection, from four percent of our oceans to 43 percent within one government, which is the largest leap. There\'s only comparison to the US during Obama in terms of protection. And this is because we want this population also to recover. You know, when you let the park stop fishing, the overflow from the fishing will actually increase the biomass sixfold. So I think one of the efforts that we need to do as we talk about the biodiversity convention that\'s going to happen this next year is that we need to change our relationship to the environment. We need to protect and conserve our ecosystems, so they provide the services that they do today. Today, 96 percent of all mammals, land mammals, are humans or stuff humans eat. Only four percent of land mammals are wild. When I heard that data, from ""National Geographic,"" for the first time, I couldn\'t believe it. We\'ve changed our relationship with the planet, and we\'re suffering these decisions because we see zoonotic diseases -- not just coronavirus -- spread time after time.', '15:00': 'WPR: And we have Bruno here -- hi, Bruno -- with a question from the community.', '15:04': 'Bruno Giussani: Hi. Absolutely. Hello, Marcelo. This is a question from Melissa Mahoney. She asks if you can expand on what economic benefits of net-zero emissions are. And especially, could those benefits be the same for Chile and for other countries?', '15:23': ""MM: Good. For example, when I worked in the World Bank, we supported Chile to look into the macroeconomic impacts of the net-zero target. And it was shown that Chile will grow 4.4 percent more. So we turned the risk of climate change, and we turned it into an opportunity of expanded growth. This manifests in lower transportation costs, lower energy costs, and this makes the economy more competitive. The costs of reaching the net-zero target are much lower than the benefits that we will have to reap. And we're not even talking about cleaner air benefits, we're talking about direct economic benefits of having increased investments, which is something that every country will require in these years to recover from the COVID crisis, and lower energy costs. So that's how it manifests, and this is a consensus today that we need to have more renewable energy because this is the way that we've had cleaner air and lower energy costs."", '16:22': 'BG: There is another question from someone in the audience, asking, ""Countries across Latin America have very different attitudes on climate. Can you comment on that?""', '16:37': ""MM: So Pew Research Center has been putting out reports regarding what is the main external threat that you have. And in Europe, in the US, the biggest threat was either China or ISIS or some external bellicose threat. In Latin America and Africa, it's climate change, number one, and Chile is one of the highest, with 86 percent of Chileans saying that climate change is the greatest external threat. And this is also very high across the region. We could have populist governments coming in, changing their priorities, but the reality is, people are concerned, because they see the threat of climate change every day, and regardless of whether the national government believes in it, climate change is real and is causing impacts and causing poverty in the region."", '17:24': 'BG: Thank you, Marcelo. Back to you, Whitney.', '17:27': 'WPR: Thank you. Thank you, Bruno. And Marcelo, just one last question before we actually say goodbye, which is just, knowing that you were involved in the negotiations for the Paris Agreement, are there things that you take from that experience that you can apply to this moment as we think about emerging from this crisis and coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic?', '17:49': ""MM: Yes, that there will always be a populist that will be opposing climate action, and the way to get at this is to make the economic case, so regardless of what happens, there will be an economic case for spending on renewable energy. The US grew its renewable energy investments around 40 percent last year. In Brazil, it grew almost 10 percent. And so therefore, if we are able to align the economic goals with climate goals, you will be able to make this go forward. There's the Network for Greening the Financial System that puts together central bankers. The World Bank launched a coalition of finance ministers for climate action. These are great efforts that will allow us to have the financial system support climate action because there's an economic benefit, because it's important for you, for your fiduciary responsibilities, to disclose the risks you have, both transitionally and physically. And if we are able to do this, regardless of what negotiations happen, because there will always be problems with the consensus, you will continue to have a resilient approach because climate action will continue because you can have the economic system support this."", '18:59': ""WPR: That's really great. Thank you so much, Marcelo, for being with us to share your perspective and your insight. It's really great to sort of zoom in on some of the things happening in Chile and how that might apply to all of us all over the world. Thank you for joining us today."", '19:13': 'MM: Thanks.'}"

I\'m going to tell you about some of my research, where I provided evidence for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let\'s look at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many, many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I\'m just going to walk through it for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow outwards at their centers. At the center where those radial lines are, it\'s wider in your visual field than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it\'s a remarkably simple stimulus. It\'s just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most complicated objects in the universe be unable to render this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you\'ve been encountering this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails, or blur lines, on your retina. They\'re activating mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version of what happens in real life and this another version of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it\'s not that in real life you see blur lines. The point is that it\'s the stimulus at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that\'s what tells your brain that you\'re moving. When you move forward, your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates, little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates when you\'re moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird optic blur stuff, and it tells you the direction you\'re moving. Alright, that\'s half the story. That\'s what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it\'s looking at the first image, that you\'re actually on your way, moving towards the center. It still doesn\'t explain why you should perceive these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand that our brains are slow. What you would like is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn\'t work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second doesn\'t sound very long, but it\'s a long time in normal behaviors. If you\'re moving just at one meter per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second, you\'ve moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn\'t correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped into it or just passed it. And of course, this is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it\'s going to be much worse in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can\'t passively respond and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess about the next moment. What will the world look like in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you\'ll have a perception of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence -- and there\'s other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I\'ve shown that huge swaths of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines are suggesting that I\'m moving. What happens to them? Well, let\'s imagine. Imagine you\'ve got a doorway. You\'ve got a doorway. Imagine it\'s a cathedral doorway, to make it more concrete -- it\'ll be helpful in a second. When you\'re very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens when you get closer. It all flows outwards in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you\'re really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn\'t go outwards nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that\'s more like this next picture. The projective geometry -- that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this, well, your brain has no problem, there\'s just two vertical lines and no cues that there\'ll be a change in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you\'re going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed perceptions of the future, because they\'re just static images on the page, they\'re not changing like in real life. And let me just end by showing one illusion here. If I can, I\'ll quickly show two. This one\'s fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I\'ve added blur to these optic flow lines, your brain says, ""They\'re probably already moving, that\'s why they\'re blurry."" When you do it, they should be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn\'t be moving that much. And a final one I\'ll just leave in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get on your retina when things are moving. You don\'t have to do anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving when they shouldn\'t be. It\'s weird, right? But what you have now are the cues that, from your brain\'s point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like, ""Oh, these things are moving."" Render a perception of what they\'ll do in the next moment -- they should be moving and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)'}"

In his tender talk from TEDxKyoto, Hirano suggests that with the help of our loved ones we can begin to honestly and completely love who we are. (In Japanese with English subtitles).",,,121296,2018-07-03T14:35:42+00:00,"['personal growth', 'self', 'relationships', 'love', 'life', 'communication']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', '日本語']",Keiichiro Hirano,Novelist,"{'0:00': 'As I have been recently hearing about disturbing sad news, I often think about the idea of loving yourself. We have been taught to love other people as an important value, but I think loving our own selves hasn\'t been considered to be an issue worth talking about. Why? It may be because it\'s too obvious, that we love ourselves, to take up the issue and stress the importance. All of us can\'t avoid being egoistic, sometimes. We want to have things our own way. If everything in our life is going well, can we love ourselves? Not necessarily so. The reason why it\'s hard to discuss ""self-love"" may be that it has a kind of a narcissistic whiff and sounds a little icky to people. If we saw somebody looking in the mirror, saying, ""How I love myself! Don\'t bother me!""... I am not talking about myself! We would want to say, ""Suit yourself! Keep looking in the mirror."" I want to say it doesn\'t have to be like that, to love ourselves. Life isn\'t always easy. It would be, of course, nice if we were happy all our life. But in our life, many people might say, ""I hate you,"" or ""I wish you would disappear from this world."" Going through the agony, we ultimately reach the realization that we have to love ourselves in the sense of taking responsibility for ourselves and looking after ourselves. If, when people tell us, ""I hate you,"" we respond to it by saying, ""Yes, I hate myself, too,"" the moment we said so, I\'m sure we would lose our desire to go on living. I\'ve felt the need for that kind of attitude more than once myself. Since we don\'t know what will happen in the future, the kind of situation in which we have to love ourselves might arise again, in the sense of needing to take care of ourselves. It would be wonderful if you could live a trouble-free life. For a quite long time, I couldn\'t figure out what kind of person I was. When I did something good for others, people showed appreciation to me, and then I thought I was basically a pretty good person. Like that, I had occasions that made me feel relieved. On the other hand, when I would really hurt someone, I was very disappointed in myself, feeling like I was fundamentally a cruel person. To love ourselves actually may be harder than to love any other person, because we know ourselves thoroughly, through and through. Looking back at all we have done in the past, and remembering: ""Boy, I did such things as this and that..."" And not only the good things we\'ve done, but unpleasant things we\'ve done also come back at us. Can we love ourselves with knowing all those sides of us? At this point, I thought, in our thought process, there must be something fundamentally wrong. Then, I started by doing this to change it: First, I honestly looked back at myself, seeing a pretty good person, or one not so good. And for the time being, I accepted all my ""selves,"" good or bad. Instead of being judgmental about myself, thinking ""I may be a nice guy at heart,"" or ""I may be basically a cruel person,"" ""Which one is really me?"" I decided to accept all my ""selves"" as parts of myself, and thought about why I had so many varied ""selves"" in this one person. To sum it up, it\'s in response to different people and different situations. When I talk to my grandmother, I am very relaxed. When I talk to people at work, I may sound serious, putting on a serious look, talking about difficult things. When I talk to somebody who rubs me the wrong way, you can bet the tone of my voice can\'t be this calm. I try not to come into contact with such a person in the first place. In any case, each ""self"" of mine has its own uniqueness. To love each ""self"" of mine equally in order to love myself may be very difficult, but I can say, ""I love my \'self\' when I am with this person. I become somebody whom I even abhor when I am with that person. But I like my \'self\' pretty well when I am with this particular person. I am not too bad."" In fact, to love ourselves may not be that hard after all. Take romance. Suppose there are two girls, and I have feelings toward both of them. One day I have a date with one of them, and have dinner with her. I enjoy being with her, talking a lot, frequently interjecting jokes, smiling at each other, and we interact with each other very well. Then suddenly I notice it\'s the time for the last train. I rush to the train station to catch the last one. And at home, I\'m happy with myself. As for the other girl, I also like her, but during our date, I can\'t talk or joke that much... And we often get awkward silences. I feel like a miserable loser. I don\'t feel like going on with her, so after having dinner, we say goodbye to each other. After the two dates, if I were asked which one I would rather see again, I would choose the first one without hesitation. There\'s no doubt I like her, but rather because I like my ""self"" when I am with her. I enjoy my ""self"" when I am with her, and find life worth living in the life of that ""self"" of mine. The definition of ""love"" may be to love somebody else, this surely is not wrong, but what I would like to add to it is: Rather, to love means, with the help of the person we love, for us to be able to love ourselves. That\'s what I\'d like to think. ""I can reveal my inner self as I wish without any difficulties, being true to myself, when I am with that person, and it will never happen with anybody else."" Unfortunately, some of our relationships come to end. Some end out of disputes. Others end due to death. When we grieve over losing our loved ones, we miss the voice and hug of the person, and many other things, but I wonder if we may rather be grieving over losing the life of our ""self"" who lived with that person, thinking: ""Only with them could I talk freely like that. Only with them could I be honest with myself. Only with them could I be silly like that. But that person is gone now, and I can\'t live the life of that \'self\' of mine I love any longer."" I wonder if that is what we really grieve over. And, of course, vice versa. If somebody says to me, ""I love you,"" I will be euphoric, yelling, ""Yes!"" But if I were told, ""Thanks to you, I come to love myself,"" or ""I love myself when I\'m with you more than when I am with anybody else,"" that would be something which strikes my heart more. That my existence validates one person\'s existence that way moves me with a deep joy, something poignant. Each time when we find one ""self"" we love, we may be finding our foothold we need to go on living. In our life, we feel like we need to be loved by many people, a certain percentage of people in our groups, in our class, our workplace. But not that many of those ""selves"" we love may be necessary. If we find two or three of our ""selves"" we love in ourselves, we can go on with those as our foothold. Five or six may be more than enough. You may think you only have 3 friends in your class at school or you may think three that many friends who help you like yourself. All depends on how you take it. To love ourselves doesn\'t mean saying: ""I am crazy about myself,"" looking into a mirror, but, instead, it means, with the help of or via somebody else, for us to come to love ourselves. It\'s probably where we start really loving ourselves. And that is why, as we feel the need, we love others as indispensable individuals. That\'s all I want to say. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

Initially, I wasn\'t allowed to play with them because, as my parents said, ""Them too rambunctious"" --', '00:31': '(Laughter)', '00:32': 'so I could only watch them from my window. Rollerskating was one of their favorite activities. They loved hitching a ride at the back of the city bus, letting go of the rear bumper as the bus arrived at the bottom of the block in front of my building. One day there was a new girl with them. I heard the usual squeals of laughter interspersed with, ""Mira, mira! Mira, mira!"" Spanish for, ""Look, look!"" The group grabbed onto the back of the bus at the top of the block, and as they rolled down laughing and screaming, ""Mira, mira, mira, mira,"" the bus abruptly stopped. The experienced riders adjusted and quickly let go, but the new girl lurched back and fell onto the pavement. She didn\'t move.', '01:18': 'The adults outside ran to help her. The bus driver came out to see what had happened and call for an ambulance. There was blood coming from her head. She didn\'t open her eyes. We waited for the ambulance, and waited, and everyone said, ""Where is the ambulance? Where is the ambulance?"" The police finally arrived. An older black American man said, ""Ain\'t no ambulance coming."" He said it again loudly to the cop. ""You know ain\'t no ambulance coming. They never send no ambulance here.""

Then when I moved [to] Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily, poor black and brown people. Within a few years, an infection seen in a select population became a worldwide epidemic. Again I got the urge to do something. Fortunately, with the help of activists and advocates and educators and physicians like me who treat the disease, we found a way forward. There was a massive education effort to reduce HIV transmission and provide legal protection for those with the disease. There was a political will to make sure that as many patients as possible worldwide, regardless of ability to pay, could get access to medication. Within a couple of decades there were new treatments that transformed this life-threatening infection to a chronic disease, like diabetes. Now there's a vaccine on the horizon."", '03:25': 'Over the last five to seven years, I\'ve noticed a different epidemic among the patients in Florida, and it looks something like this.

Ms. Anna Mae was one of my more adherent patients, so I was surprised she needed refills of her breathing medicines earlier than usual. Towards the end of the visit, she handed me a Florida Power and Light form and asked me to sign it. She was behind on her light bill. This form allowed physicians to document serious medical conditions requiring equipment that would be impacted if the patient\'s electricity was disconnected. ""But Ms. Anna Mae,"" I said, ""you don\'t use any medical devices for breathing. I don\'t think you qualify."" Further questioning revealed she had been using her air conditioner day and night because of the heat so she could breathe.

And then it was thanks to international health agencies, NGOs, politicians and pharmaceutical companies that HIV medication became available in low-income countries.

We can help them get necessary equipment in those homes when conditions worsen.

Why is this? You can't tell me that there aren't millions upon millions of prodigiously gifted musicians of disability around the world. Where is their platform? Where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them so that they can collaborate with other great musicians?"", '02:36': ""So, ladies and gentlemen, as you can probably tell, I'm on a bit of a mission. And this mission has a personal root to it. I have four children, the youngest of whom was born with cerebral palsy. She's now five, and through her glorious existence, I suppose I have now become a fully paid-up member of the amazing, dizzyingly wonderful disabled community. And I find myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking what an incredible model that is. It's taken a good five decades, actually, but I can say with hand on heart that when the Paralympics comes to London next year, there will not be an intelligent person anywhere on the planet who does not absolutely believe in the validity of disabled sportspeople. What an amazing position to be in!"", '03:22': 'So, ladies and gentlemen, where the hell is music in all this? Apologies to any of you who are sports fans, but music is far more universal than sport. Where is the platform? Where is their voice? So, we in the UK are at the very early stages in forming what will be Britain\'s first-ever national disabled orchestra. We are going to call it the British Paraorchestra, because with the world\'s eyes on London next year and particularly on the Paralympics, we want to throw down the gauntlet to every single other country that is represented there, to say to them, ""Here\'s our paraorchestra. Where\'s yours?"" Every country should have a multiplicity of paraorchestras of all shapes and sizes, no question.', '04:09': ""Now, today is a very special day for me, because it is the first time that the first four members of my little embryonic paraorchestra are going to play in public; four extraordinary musicians of which the number will grow and grow. I hope in the end the Paraorchestra could even be as big as 50 musicians. We present to you today a little sonic adventure, a little piece of improvisational whimsy, if you like, a piece on which, of course, the ink is still wet, the clay is still wet. After all, improvisation is never a fixed thing. We decided what we wanted to share with you, at the heart of our improvisation, was a tune which is beloved of British people. It's one of the only folk melodies that we still recognize in our culture. And here's an interesting thing: folk music can tell you an awful lot about the cultural DNA of the country from which it originates. You see, we in Britain are quietly melancholic. You know, the rain ... it does rain. The food's not so good."", '05:09': '(Laughter)', '05:10': 'Quietly melancholic. Not blackly so, just quietly so. And as Shakespeare put it so brilliantly in ""Twelfth Night,"" he loves music that has ""a dying fall.""', '05:22': 'So this melody, ""Greensleeves,"" is chock-full of ""dying fall."" You may know this tune.', '05:28': '(Singing) Da, da, da da da da, dying fall.', '05:31': '(Laughter)', '05:32': 'Da da da, da da da da, dying fall.', '05:34': 'Da dee, da da na na ... dying fall ... na na nee, na ah ah ah ah.', '05:38': 'Brief burst of sunshine, ladies and gentlemen, the chorus --', '05:41': '(Singing) Ya da da da, dying fall ...', '05:43': '(Laughter)', '05:44': '(Singing) Da da dee, da da da da, dying fall ...', '05:47': 'Ya da da da, dying fall ...', '05:50': ""OK? It's like we need some melodic Viagra in our culture, ladies and gentlemen."", '05:55': '(Laughter)', '05:57': '(Applause)', '06:03': ""It goes without saying that we are very much at the starting gates with this project. We need your help, we need the global community to help us deliver this dream, so that this orchestra can be full steam ahead by summer 2012. If you think there's any way that you can help us, please, please, get in touch."", '06:23': 'And so, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me enormous pride, pleasure and joy to introduce to you, with a short improvisation upon that most melancholic tune, ""Greensleeves,"" the first four members of the British Paraorchestra.', '06:37': '(Applause) (Cheers)', '06:48': '(Music)', '13:01': '(Applause)', '13:11': '(Cheers) (Applause)'}"

Historian Keith Lowe thinks the answer lies in what we choose to remember and what we choose to forget about history. In his talk, Lowe describes the grey areas of an epochal event often considered in black and white terms, and argues that we need to challenge our assumptions to avoid repeating historical mistakes.",,,107704,2019-03-01T20:29:13+00:00,"['war', 'history', 'society', 'future', 'global issues']","['English', 'Português de Portugal', 'Српски, Srpski']",,,"{'0:00': 'Hello everybody. Audience: Hello. Keith Lowe: Fantastic! This is like a schoolroom or something. (Laughter) My name is Keith Lowe. I am an historian of the Second World War and its aftermath, and even I have to admit that I\'ve chosen a pretty crowded field to study. I went into my local bookshop recently, and this is what I saw. Thousands of books about the Second World War are published every year, and, actually, to tell you the truth, this is only a very tiny selection of what\'s on offer. We in the West, and, actually, increasingly people in other parts of the world too, we are just a little bit obsessed by the Second World War. We have whole TV stations which seem devoted to it. We write books about it, we write novels about it, we make films about it. We have university courses which are devoted to the Second World War. Whole museums are built to house World War II collections. Even our politicians like to get in on this act. Whenever there is an important anniversary of the war, they tend to gather and commemorate it, and make speeches. So, for example, at the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, June 2014, 17 heads of state took time out of their schedules to come and spend the day on the Normandy beaches. Seventeen! This included people like Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and so on. From my own country, we sent not only our Prime Minister, but also Queen Elisabeth II, who is - I mean, she is now in her nineties and largely retired from public life. What other international event can do all this? Even international summits struggle to get so many world leaders into one place at the same time. My question is: Why? What is it that all these world leaders, in fact what is it that all of us, think it is that we\'re remembering? Why are we all so obsessed by the the Second World War? You might think that somebody like me would be pretty pleased with this situation. As long as the World War II industry is booming, I am always going to have a job, right? But actually there is something about it that I find really a little bit disturbing, and I don\'t know whether that is just because I have an inherent distrust of a lot of politicians, or whether it\'s because I\'ve been trained to always question everything. But it strikes me that a lot of the rhetoric that gets thrown around about the Second World War, particularly by people like politicians and journalists and diplomats and so on, a lot of it doesn\'t seem to be about the Second World War at all; it seems to be about something else. I\'m not sure if I\'ve exactly put my finger on precisely what that thing is, but it seems to be something like a way of fostering national pride, or just trying to get people to feel good about themselves. Along the way, it seems to me that the Second World War has been turned into a little bit of a cartoon, where everybody knows who the good guys were, and everybody knows who the bad guys were. There is precious little space left anymore for any of that difficult grey area in between. To give you some kind of an idea about what on earth it is I am going on about, let me tell you a story from my own country, from Britain. In Britain, we like to think we are the real heroes of the Second World War. We tell stories about how we stood alone against the Nazis, about how we endured the bombing of the Blitz; how we kept calm and carried on, and eventually fought our way back into Europe and liberated it. We still call the Second World War ""Our Finest Hour"", as if it is some kind of golden age in our history. So whenever there is any kind of anniversary, or important event based around the Second World War, we Brits really go for it. One of these events happened quite recently, in the summer of 2012, when we opened up a brand new war memorial right in the middle of central London. It was a memorial to the men of Bomber Command, the men who flew the planes over Germany, dropped bombs and so on. This is what it looks like. As you can see, it\'s not exactly a shy and retiring piece of architecture, it\'s actually quite huge. It\'s by far the largest war memorial that we have in London, and I can tell you there are a lot of war memorials in London. As you walk into this thing, there is an inscription which tells you that it\'s dedicated to the 55,000 men of Bomber Command who lost their lives during World War II. Now, when this first opened, in the summer of 2012, I went along to have a look, see what I thought of it, have a walk around. There is something really quite moving about it actually. You step in through these great big pillars, and, up on the wall, you can see carved into the stone, there is a quotation from Winston Churchill saying exactly how much we owe to these men who lost their lives. Parts of the memorial are built out of an actual World War II aircraft that was shot down during the war. So they put a lot of thought into this. It\'s actually really quite inspiring. So as I was walking around this monument, I couldn\'t help but feel this real surge of pride. I felt proud of these men who had given their lives for something that I hold dear. I felt proud of my country, I felt proud of the British way of life which had produced heroes like this. And yet, there was this little voice in the back of my head which just wouldn\'t go away because I know that 55,000 men of Bomber Command died during World War II, but I also know that 500,000 Germans died beneath the bombs that these men dropped. A lot of those Germans were Nazis, and I dare say that a lot of them probably deserved it. But the vast majority of these people were just ordinary men, women and children, just like you and me. Are any of these people at all mentioned on this memorial? Of course they are not. If you would suggest such a thing in the summer of 2012, you probably would have been lynched. The Germans were our enemies during the Second World War. You can\'t mention the Germans on a British national monument. And yet not to mention them, to pretend that somehow this didn\'t happen, or even worse, that somehow it doesn\'t matter, that too makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable. Okay, the Germans are a difficult problem, so let\'s just put them to one side for a minute, and let\'s think instead about the other nationalities. And here is where the story starts getting interesting. Because if there is one thing that we Brits always forget about the bomber war, it\'s the fact that we didn\'t only bomb Germany. More than a third of British and American bombs dropped on Europe during the war were dropped not on Germany but on those countries we were supposed to be liberating. As a consequence, 50,000 French civilians were killed by our bombs. 10,000 Dutch civilians were killed by our bombs. Are any of these people mentioned on this memorial? Of course they\'re not. And it was while I was thinking about that particular group, that it finally dawned on me - actually something I probably should have realized right from the start - which is that memorials like this aren\'t designed to tell the whole story; they are only designed to tell those parts of the story that make British people feel good about themselves. That\'s all very well and good, but it does come at a cost. And I couldn\'t help thinking when I was walking around this thing: This was the summer of 2012, this was the summer when the Olympic Games was coming to London. So at exactly the moment when the entire world was arriving in our city, the message that we were advertising was that we will remember our wartime dead, but we won\'t remember yours. It\'s like the exact opposite of the Olympic spirit. It\'s not only the British who do this, of course it\'s not. Every nation does it, the Americans, for example. The Americans like to call their wartime veterans ""the greatest generation that any society has ever produced"", as if they have some kind of monopoly on heroism or something. (Laughter) They backed it up with a thousand Hollywood movies full of square-jawed American heroes defeating evil in the name of truth and freedom. The Chinese are the same. You know that in 2013 alone, Chinese TV companies produced over 200 TV dramatizations about the Second World War, each of them telling almost an identical story. Only, of course, this time, it\'s the Japanese who are all the evil monsters, and the Chinese who are all selfless heroes. And, of course, I could say the same thing about the French or the Koreans or the Norwegians or the Greeks. We all do this. We all like to think that we were the heroes. We all like to think that we were the victims. But what we don\'t like to remember is those grey areas. And it\'s that which I find most uncomfortable about this, because, as far as I am concerned, it\'s the grey areas that make history interesting. In a sense, all good history is about the grey areas. But a lot of people don\'t seem to have time for complicated stories. They don\'t have time for difficult and uncomfortable emotions. In fact, I\'m quickly coming to the conclusion that a lot of people don\'t really have time for history at all. What they really want is a myth. Now, you might ask yourselves: What does any of this matter? I mean, we all like a good story, don\'t we? If that story makes us feel good about ourselves, then so much the better. It\'s all in the past anyway, so what does it matter? But that\'s just the problem, isn\'t it? Because it\'s not all in the past. And there is a dark side to all of these stories and myths that can be really damaging. When the former Yugoslavia tore itself apart in the 1990s, it did so with World War II songs on its lips, and World War II atrocities in its heart. When the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014, Ukrainians and Russians accused one another of acting like Nazis. And then, of course, Hillary Clinton weighed in and started comparing Vladimir Putin to Hitler. These sorts of comparisons don\'t do anything to foster rational debate. If you were in an argument with someone, the last thing that is going to calm things down is that you start accusing them of being a Nazi. If you don\'t believe me, next time you\'re in an argument with your wife or your husband, give it a try and see what kind of reaction you get. (Laughter) I can see some of you seem to have tried it. (Laughter) My point is that as soon as we start bringing the Second World War into any of our arguments, we get so sort of carried away with our own national myths that all we actually end up doing is stirring things back up again. Let me give you a couple of examples. Take this economic crisis which has rocked the world since 2008. Here we are in Athens, and you all know about the economic crisis. All across Southern Europe, people have been suffering a real austerity, and largely this has been imposed by the European Union. But it\'s not always the European Union that gets the blame for this. Quite often, as the largest and most powerful country in the union, it\'s Germany that gets the blame. Now, how has this been portrayed in the press? Have we had a calm, rational economic debate about it? This is the way that the Italian press portrayed the situation in 2012: ""Quarto Reich."" (Laughter) ""The Fourth Reich."" This is the Italian way of saying that modern-day Germany is no better than the Nazis, as if there is a direct link between World War II and today. And take a look at that picture. They\'ve managed to dig something out that makes it look like Angela Merkel is making a Nazi salute. (Laughter) How about the Greek press? (Laughter) How have the Greeks portrayed it? Well, here is a Greek newspaper. (Laughter) from the same year, 2012, and you will notice a photograph of Angela Merkel once again, this time in a Nazi uniform. Obviously, it has been photoshopped. But what about that headline in red? ""Memorandum macht frei."" This is a direct reference to the motto that was written above the gates of the concentration camps in places like Auschwitz and Dachau. The implication here is that the whole of Greece is going to become like one giant German concentration camp as a consequence of the economic deal they\'ve had to do. Now, this is the sort of thing that makes an historian like me want to just give up and go and become a window cleaner or something. (Laughter) I mean, it\'s historical nonsense. None of these headlines have anything to do with the Second World War at all. They are about a modern-day problem, a modern situation. The only reason to mention the Second World War is to provoke an emotional response. If I have one message that I want you to take away with you today, it is this: Whenever you hear a politician, or a journalist, or a diplomat, mention the Second World War, I want alarm bells to ring. Because when public figures speak about the Second World War, they are not talking about what actually happened, they\'re invoking a myth. So whenever you hear a politician mention the war, I want you to ask yourselves what it is he is really trying to do. Is he trying to inspire you? - In which case that is relatively harmless. Or is he trying to fill you with fear? Is he trying to draw people together? In which case, again, that is relatively harmless. Or is he really trying to drive people apart? And above all, I want you to remind yourselves, and to remind everybody you know, that the Second World War is over. (Laughter) We live in a different world, with different values and different problems. These problems will never be solved, and they certainly will never be solved peacefully, if all we can think to do is to resurrect the Second World War. You know, history is a messy business, particularly the history of the Second World War. It\'s not there to make us feel good about ourselves; it\'s often ugly and uncomfortable, and desperately complicated. It\'s full of those grey areas. If we could all just learn to accept that, then this world, our world, would be a much more peaceful place. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

Almost exactly 10 years ago, I was sitting in an exam room that was way too cold waiting to meet my new oncologist. I was terrified. Even though my partner at the time was sitting right by my side, I felt completely alone. I had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, and it seemed at the time that a single bright spot on a scan of my right lung meant that the cancer had already spread. I had metastatic breast cancer. I had no medical training at this point, but I knew what it meant if it were true: incurable breast cancer. Terminal breast cancer. I was 27 years old, had just been accepted to medical school, and I wondered if I was already at the end of my life."", '01:07': 'My new oncologist was not a warm person. She dealt in simple facts, as many brilliant physicians do. ""Our body is made up of cells,"" she started. I stopped her. ""I\'m starting medical school soon. I know."" Instead of taking this as a signal to go backward, to start again, she went forward. She said that I would need to start on chemotherapy to control the cancer. She launched into the details of the drug and the side effects and the schedule. I reminded her that we hadn\'t even yet biopsied the bright spot on my lung, and I asked if she was sure that it was cancer.', '01:54': ""I remember viscerally how she seemed almost frustrated with my question. Perhaps she thought I wasn't following along with her explanations, or, worse still, I was in denial. I simply wanted her to understand that, as her patient, the biopsy was not just a mere formality to prove an already foregone conclusion. It was a steel needle through skin, muscle and bone that would deliver a deep piece of me to the surface and answer a question I wish didn't have to be asked. Before the biopsy, I could be a 27-year-old woman who might have metastatic breast cancer, who probably had metastatic breast cancer. This is a critical distinction, but it's not one that's emphasized in the most elite oncology training. Instead, I was dismissed with an appointment to start treatment in just a few weeks."", '02:53': 'So much has happened since that first visit. Ironically, the biopsy was not just a mere formality. My former oncologist was right.', '03:03': '(Laughter)', '03:04': 'It did show cancer, but it was a totally separate lung cancer, and as crazy as it sounds, this was great news. I did not have metastatic breast cancer, I had two different cancers, but both of them were localized, and so the lung cancer was localized enough that it could be removed. And so the onslaught of treatments began with a lung surgery, continued with chemotherapy and ended with a breast surgery just after my 28th birthday.', '03:36': 'And then two weeks later, I started medical school. My new oncologist --', '03:44': '(Laughter)', '03:45': 'who deals much more fluidly both with facts and their implications, very reasonably suggested that I should defer my acceptance to medical school for a year, take some time to rest, to recover, and I trusted her advice. I felt terrible during the intensive chemotherapy sessions. And so I wrote to the dean. I explained my circumstances, and a deferral was speedily granted.', '04:12': 'But as the chemo fog lifted, I wondered what I was going to do with a year. Should I go to the beach?', '04:21': '(Laughter)', '04:22': ""I wasn't really a beach person."", '04:25': '(Laughter)', '04:26': 'And how many years did I have left, anyway? I really wanted to go to medical school. It seemed like a missing piece of my puzzle.', '04:35': ""So instead of going around and around with indecision, I asked myself: What's the worst that could happen? Well, I could be too weak or too sick to do the work. It could be too hard for me emotionally. I could fail out of medical school. But then I remembered, that wouldn't be the worst thing that happened to me even that year. So why not get started? Why not continue living the way that I wanted to live? So I did."", '05:05': 'Bald and rail thin, I put on my best earrings and my favorite dress, and I started. I pretended to belong, and I began to. There is no way to describe how hard it was. Some days it felt impossible. It felt as if I was doing things that would never matter in the future. But every day, I asked myself: Are you still enjoying this? Is this still what you want to be doing? And every day, the answer was yes, sometimes a very qualified yes, but a yes.', '05:40': ""And then, just as I was getting comfortable and feeling like I might not necessarily fail out of medical school, I received even more devastating news. I learned that I had a mutation in a gene called TP53, or p53 for short. Known as the guardian of the genome, a mutation -- p53 is responsible for supervising the repair of our DNA. A mutation in this gene means errors go uncorrected. It means that normal cells become cancerous at a much higher rate. All of a sudden, with this knowledge, my medical history made a terrible kind of sense. I had had a childhood cancer -- rhabdomyosarcoma -- at age seven. It recurred when I was a teenager. And this was all before p53 had been discovered in the lab. Then I'd had young adult breast and lung cancers."", '06:33': 'With the knowledge of this mutation, it seemed that there was likely no end to the number of cancers that I could expect in my future. And yet, I decided to become a radiation oncologist.', '06:48': '(Laughter)', '06:49': 'I hoped to graduate from residency in just a few months, move to a new city and start my first real job as a doctor and researcher, because of grit, because of privilege, because of therapy, because of my medical teams and my family and my teachers, because genetic diagnoses should give us the knowledge to move forward.', '07:18': ""And even in the year 2020, that generally doesn't mean miracle cures or medical breakthroughs. Having a devastating genetic diagnosis means learning to live with uncertainty. It means learning that you and your diagnosis are not the worst thing that could happen. Learning to live with uncertainty means walking forward into a life that is as full of beauty as it is of challenges. It means learning for yourself that cancer is just part of your story. It may not be the worst thing that happens to you, and if it is, that's OK. You can claim that, and you can own that, but let that be a narrative that you author and you authorize, not one that's prescribed to you by someone else. Have your deferral letter in hand, but use it on your terms."", '08:13': 'As I come to the end of my oncology training, I have déjà vu again and again with the following scenario: A patient has cancer. There are several options, all of which offer a different balance between cure and quality of life, between the possibility of alleviating suffering and the possibility of causing suffering. An oncologist lays out the options, but, somewhere in the discussion, things get skewed. The choice becomes something more like, ""Well, you could choose to do something, or you could choose to do nothing. We could be aggressive, and treat your cancer, or we could watch it."" And 9.9 times out of 10, the patient says, ""I want to do everything I can do."" Of course. Who wouldn\'t want everything?', '09:09': ""But what is everything? Is everything the ability to sit in your own home in front of your window bathed in sunshine and surrounded by family? Is everything still being able to feel your fingers and your toes, because they haven't gone numb from chemotherapy? As oncologists, our everything is cancer treatment. It's radiation and surgery and chemotherapy and novel treatments. And for us, the worst thing that could happen -- and I have heard more than one oncologist say this -- the worst thing that could happen is that the patient will develop metastatic disease. Or, the worst thing that could happen is that five years from now, the cancer will grow, and I'll have to give more radiation."", '09:56': 'As a patient and as an oncologist, I would never argue that these are not devastating outcomes. But are they the worst? Should cancer control be at the center of our thinking, always?', '10:13': 'Many unspeakably, unfathomably painful and brutal things have happened to me because of my cancers and my genetic mutation. And yet, I consider myself very lucky indeed, because the worst thing that could happen never came to pass; because I have let devastation and uncertainty sit at the table, but somewhere off to the side. When I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I went to Boston for a second opinion, because what could I lose? When my oncologist gave me very good and very safe and very standard advice, I started medical school anyway, even though I was undergoing active cancer treatment.', '10:57': ""Instead of shying away from patients with cancer, I became a radiation oncologist, and I work with patients who are very much like me every single day. Instead of imagining the suffering that I might cause to a future partner when I died of cancer, I married my wonderful husband. Because the worst thing that can happen is always a series of negatives. It's blank spaces that should be filled with life."", '11:29': 'So what is the most that I have leaned in to this kind of radical uncertainty? Well, this is William. He is the most joyful person that I have ever met, and in just over a year, he has already made the world a better place.', '11:55': ""As oncologists, we talk to our patients as if the worst thing that could happen is that their cancer could come back, or that it could spread, or that they could die from it. As a patient, I know that these are paramount. But I want to change the way that we think about this, and I want to change the way that we talk about this with our patients. As a patient, the worst thing that can happen is that cancer robs you of opportunity, of the ability to be and to do and to love. And it will. At least temporarily it will. But to minimize this loss of life in the living, that is the harder, and I would say, truer job of the oncologist: to take all the tools that we have and situate them in the context of a patient's whole entire life; to be guides for how to sit with suffering, acknowledge it deeply, but to not let fear of future suffering be the narrative for the journey forward."", '13:03': ""One of my mentors always says the medicine part is easy. And it never feels that way to a junior doctor, but its contours are finite. We have big studies to guide us, and it's what we learn to do in residency. Much harder is learning how to help each patient navigate the multitudes contained in their illness."", '13:34': ""So I find it really funny that, in retrospect, my life looks like a neat package. It looks as if I planned each successive step and that perhaps cancer has led to the good things in my life. Step one: apply to medical school. Step two: get diagnosed with and treated for cancer. And step three: have it all, a career and a family. But I will tell you that each phase was a leap of faith despite an almost paralyzing uncertainty. And so it's that courage that I try to give to each of my patients. I try to do this regardless of the technical medical details of cancers and treatment decisions and mutations, regardless of the slippery fiction of prognosis. I try to learn what they want and what they need, what they wish and what they worry, what they dream about, what animated them before and what will sustain them during the beastly process of cancer treatment. It doesn't actually take that much time. It does take a few focused, quiet moments that require intentional cultivation.

Yes, that's all very well, but that's not something we can do anything about really. And indeed, asteroids do come close to the Earth from time to time. Earlier this week, one did. Luckily it didn't hit the Earth. We can't really prepare. But the key point is that the other mass extinctions in the history of life were not caused by impact. They were caused by climate change. Immediately, you can see now how that matters. I will briefly characterise one of them that I have worked upon. At the end of the Permian Period, 250 million years ago, there was another major extinction. This was before the dinosaurs. And the sequence of events was that massive volcanoes errupted in Russia. They were so huge that they poured out enormous amounts of lava, of course, but more importantly, they poured out gases into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide. And carbon dioxide is famous as a greenhouse gas, meaning it heats the atmosphere. We have primary evidence that around the equator, ocean temperatures warmed up to 40 degrees plus. So this is like a very warm shower. You might think that's OK. Maybe for 10 minutes but not for day after day after day. And so life had to progressively flee out of the equatorial zones. It became crowded at the poles and there was great extinction. So we learnt from that that carbon dioxide and global warming can cause extinction whatever the cause of that carbon dioxide, whether it comes from volcanoes or human activity. So we've learnt three things that we can illustrate and use for predicting into the future, what may happen to life. We've learnt that we can calculate the rate of extinction by looking at historical extinctions and at that rate of extinction, even at the minimal figures, it's at least one hundred times what it ought to be. Secondly, we've learnt something about risk, which species are most at risk of extinction, and I think that's fairly straightforward. But we need the evidence to be able to argue the case. And thirdly, we've learnt that the whole history of the Earth records a rich record of climate change. We don't need to do experiments, we don't need to imagine what a world would be like without the polar ice caps. It has existed and we can study it. So to conclude, my aim has not been simply to spread doom and gloom, but to indicate that we have the power to change. And in order to change, we have to accept reality along the lines that we're mentioning. And we have to ask the right questions about what we should do. And in order to decide what we should do, we need to use evidence. And some great evidence comes from the history of the Earth and the history of life. Thank you very much. (Applause)""}"

""Your anger exists in you because it offered your ancestors an evolutionary advantage,"" he says. ""It's a powerful and healthy force in your life.""",,,101779,2018-09-11T16:00:49+00:00,"['science', 'mental health', 'emotions', 'psychology', 'life']","['English', 'Español', 'Français', 'Português brasileiro', 'Ελληνικά', '日本語', '한국어']",Ryan Martin,Psychologist,"{'0:00': 'I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend, and it reads, ""You will not believe what just happened. I\'m so mad right now."" So you do the dutiful thing as a friend, and you ask for details, and they tell you a story about what happened to them at the gym or at work or on their date last night. You listen, and you try to understand why they\'re so mad. Maybe you even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad. (Laughter) Maybe you even offer some suggestions. Now, in that moment, you are doing essentially what I get to do every day because I\'m an anger researcher, and as an anger researcher, I spend a good part of my professional life - who am I kidding, also my personal life - (Laughter) studying why people get mad. I study the types of thoughts they have when they get mad and even what they do then, whether it\'s getting into fights or breaking things or even yelling at people in all caps on the Internet. (Laughter) As you can imagine, when people hear I\'m an anger researcher, they want to talk to me about their anger and share with me their anger stories. It\'s not because they need a therapist, though that does sometimes happen, it\'s really because anger is universal. It\'s something we all feel, and it\'s something they can relate to. We\'ve been feeling it since the first few months of life, when we didn\'t get what we wanted and our cries of protests, things like, ""What do you mean, you won\'t pick up the rattle, dad? I want it!"" (Laughter) We feel it throughout our teenage years, as my mom can certainly attest to with me. Sorry, mom. We feel it to the very end. In fact, anger has been with us at some of the worst moments of our lives; it\'s a natural and expected part of our grief. But it\'s also been with us at some of the best moments of our lives, with those special occasions like weddings and vacations often marred by these everyday frustrations - bad weather, travel delays - that feel horrible in the moment but then are ultimately forgotten when things go okay. So I have many conversations with people about their anger, and through those conversations, I\'ve learned that many people - and I bet many people here right now - you see anger as a problem. You see the way it interferes in your life, the way it damages relationships, maybe even in a way that\'s scary. And while I get all of that, I see anger a little differently, and today I want to tell you something important about your anger, and it\'s this: Anger is a powerful and healthy force in your life. It\'s good that you feel it. You need to feel it. But to understand all of that, we have to back up and talk about why we get mad in the first place. A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher, who wrote about this back in 1996 in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger. For most of us - and I bet most of you - it feels as simple as this: I get mad when I\'m provoked. Right? You hear it in the language people use. They say things like, ""It makes me so mad when people drive this slow."" Or ""I got mad because she left the milk out again."" Or my favorite: ""I don\'t have an anger problem; people just need to stop messing with me."" (Laughter) Now, in the spirit of better understanding those types of provocations, I ask a lot of people, including my friends and colleagues and even family, ""What are the things that really get to you? What makes you mad?"" And by the way, one of the advantages of being an anger researcher is that I\'ve spent more than a decade generating a comprehensive list of all the things that really irritate my colleagues. Right? Just in case I need it. (Laughter) But their answers are fascinating because they say things like, ""When my sports team loses,"" ""People who chew too loudly."" And it\'s surprisingly common, by the way. (Laughter) ""People who walk too slowly."" That one\'s mine. And of course, roundabouts. Right? Roundabouts. (Laughter) I can tell you honestly, there is no rage like roundabout rage. (Laughter) Sometimes their answers aren\'t minor at all. Sometimes they talk about racism and sexism and bullying and environmental destruction, big global problems we all face. But sometimes, their answers are very specific, maybe even oddly specific. ""That wet line you get across your shirt when you accidentally lean against the counter of a public bathroom."" (Laughter) Yeah, super gross, right? Or, ""Flash drives - there\'s only two ways to plug them in, so why does it always take me three tries?"" (Laughter) Whether it\'s minor or major, whether it\'s general or specific, we can look at these examples, and we can tease out some common themes. We get angry in situations that are unpleasant, that feel unfair, where our goals are blocked, that could have been avoided, and that leave us feeling powerless. This is a recipe for anger, but you can also tell that anger is probably not the only thing we\'re feeling in these situations - right? Anger doesn\'t happen in a vacuum. We can feel angry at the same time that we\'re scared or sad or feeling a host of other emotions. But here\'s the thing. These provocations - they aren\'t making us mad. At least not on their own, and we know that because if they were, we\'d all get angry over the same things, and we don\'t. The reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry, so there\'s got to be something else going on. What is that something else? Well, we know what we\'re doing and feeling at the moment of that provocation matters. We call this the pre-anger state. Are you hungry, are you tired? Are you anxious about something else, are you running late for something? When you\'re feeling those things, those provocations feel that much worse. But what matters the most is not the provocation, it\'s not the pre-anger state, it\'s this: it\'s how we interpret that provocation, it\'s how we make sense of it in our lives. When something happens to us, we first decide: is this good or bad; is it fair or unfair; is it blameworthy; is it punishable? That\'s primary appraisal, it\'s when you evaluate the event itself. We decide what it means in the context of our lives, and then, once we\'ve done that, we decide how bad it is. That\'s secondary appraisal. We say, ""Is this the worst thing that\'s ever happened, or can I cope with this?"" To illustrate that, I want you to imagine you are driving somewhere. Before I go any further, I should tell you if I were an evil genius, and I wanted to create a situation that was going to make you mad, that situation would look a lot like driving. (Laughter) It\'s true. You are, by definition, on your way somewhere, so everything that happens - traffic, other drivers, road construction - it feels like it\'s blocking your goals. There are all these written and unwritten rules of the road, and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you, usually without consequence. And who\'s violating those rules? Anonymous others, people you will never see again, making them a very easy target for your wrath. (Laughter) So you\'re driving somewhere, thus teed up to be angry, and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit. It\'s frustrating because you can\'t really see why they\'re driving so slow. Right? That\'s primary appraisal. You\'ve looked at this and you said, ""It\'s bad and it\'s blameworthy."" But maybe you also decide it\'s not that big a deal. You\'re not in a hurry, doesn\'t matter. That\'s secondary appraisal. You don\'t get angry. But now imagine you\'re on your way to a job interview. What that person is doing - it hasn\'t changed. Right? So, primary appraisal doesn\'t change: still bad, still blameworthy. But your ability to cope with it sure does because all of a sudden, you\'re going to be late to that job interview. All of a sudden, you are not going to get your dream job, the one that was going to give you piles and piles of money - right? (Laughter) Somebody else is going to get your dream job, and you\'re going to be broke. You\'re going to be destitute. You might as well stop now, turn around, move in with your parents. (Laughter) Why? Because of this person in front of me. Scratch that; this is not a person. This is a monster. (Laughter) And this monster is here just to ruin your life. (Laughter) Now, that thought process, it\'s called catastrophizing, the one where we make the worst of things. It\'s one of the primary types of thoughts that we know is associated with chronic anger. But there\'s a couple of others. Misattributing causation. Angry people tend to put blame where it doesn\'t belong, not just on people, but actually inanimate objects as well. If you think that sounds ridiculous, think about the last time you lost your car keys, and you said, ""Where did those car keys go?"" Because you know they ran off on their own. (Laughter) They tend to overgeneralize. They use words like always, never, every. ""This always happens to me."" ""I never get what I want."" Or, ""I hit every stoplight on the way here today."" Demandingness - they put their own needs ahead of the needs of others. ""I don\'t care why this person is driving so slow. They need to speed up or move over so I can get to this job interview."" And finally, inflammatory labeling. They call people fools, idiots, monsters, or a whole bunch of things I\'ve been told not to say in this TED talk. (Laughter) For a long time, psychologists have referred to these as cognitive distortions or even irrational beliefs, and yes, sometimes they are irrational. Maybe even most of the time. But sometimes, these thoughts are totally rational. There is unfairness in the world. There are cruel, selfish people, and it\'s not only okay to be angry when we\'re treated poorly, it\'s right to be angry when we\'re treated poorly. If there\'s one thing I want you to remember from my talk today, it\'s this: Your anger exists in you as an emotion because it offered your ancestors, both human and non human, with an evolutionary advantage. Just as your fear alerts you to danger, your anger alerts you to injustice. It\'s one of the ways your brain communicates to you that you have had enough. What\'s more, it energizes you to confront that injustice. Think for a second about the last time you got mad. Your heart rate increased, your breathing increased, you started to sweat. That\'s your sympathetic nervous system, or fight-or-flight system, kicking in to offer you the energy you need to respond. And that\'s just the stuff you noticed. At the same time, your digestive system slowed down so you can conserve energy. That\'s why your mouth went dry. Your blood vessels dilated to get blood to your extremities. That\'s why your face went red. It\'s all part of this complex pattern of physiological experiences that exist today because they helped your ancestors deal with cruel and unforgiving forces of nature. The problem is that the thing your ancestors did to deal with their anger, to physically fight, they\'re no longer reasonable or appropriate. You can\'t and you shouldn\'t swing a club every time you\'re provoked. (Laughter) But here\'s the good news. You are capable of something your non-human ancestors weren\'t capable of, and that is the capacity to regulate your emotions. Even when you want to lash out, you can stop yourself, and you can channel that anger into something more productive. So often when we talk about anger, we talk about how to keep from getting angry. We tell people to calm down or relax; we even tell people to let it go. All of that assumes that anger is bad, and that it\'s wrong to feel it. But instead, I like to think of anger as a motivator. The same way your thirst motivates you to get a drink of water, the same way your hunger motivates you to get a bite to eat, your anger can motivate you to respond to injustice. Because we don\'t have to think too hard to find things we should be mad about. When we go back to the beginning, yes, some of those things are silly and not worth getting angry over, but racism, sexism, bullying, environmental destruction - those things are real, those things are terrible, and the only way to fix them is to get mad first, and then channel that anger into fighting back. You don\'t have to fight back with aggression or hostility or violence. There are infinite ways that you can express your anger. You can protest; you can write letters to the editor; you can donate to and volunteer for causes. You can create art; you can create literature; you can create poetry and music. You can create a community that cares for one another and does not allow those atrocities to happen. So the next time you feel yourself getting angry, instead of trying to turn it off, I hope you\'ll listen to what that anger is telling you, and then I hope you\'ll channel it into something positive and productive. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

I have previously lived at two addresses in Sussex, and two others in North East London. While growing up, my family lived in a detached house in Kent and took holidays to India every year. They mostly did their shopping online at Ocado, gave money to charities and read the Financial Times. Now, I live in a recently converted flat with a private landlord, and I have a housemate. I'm interested in movies and startups, and I have taken five holidays in the past 12 months, mostly to visit friends abroad. I'm about to buy flights within 14 days. My annual salary is between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds a year. I don't own a TV or watch any scheduled programming, but I do enjoy on-demand services such as Netflix or Now TV. Last week, I passed through Upper Street in North London on Monday and Wednesday evenings at 7 p.m. I cook a little, but I tend to eat out or get takeaways often. My favourite cuisines are Thai and Mexican food. I don't own any furniture, and I don't have any children. On weeknights, I tend to spend the evenings with my university friends having dinner. I usually buy my groceries at Sainsbury's but only because it's on my way home. I don't care for cars or own one. I don't like any form of housework, and I have a cleaner who lets herself in while I'm at work. On Fridays, you'll find me at the pub after work. At home, I'm far more likely to be browsing restaurant reviews rather than managing my finances or looking at property prices online. I like the idea of living abroad someday. I prefer to work as a team than on my own. I'm ambitious, and it's important to me that my many thinks I'm doing well. I'm rarely swayed by others' views. This motley set of characteristics, attitudes, thoughts, and desires come very close to defining me as a person. It is also a precise and accurate description of what a group of companies I had never heard of, personal data trackers, had learned about me. My journey to uncover what data companies knew began in 2014, when I became curious about the murky world of data brokers, a multi-billion-pound industry of companies that collect, package, and sell detailed profiles of individuals based on their online and offline behaviours. I decided to write about it for Wired Magazine. What I found out shocked me, and reinforced my anxieties about a profit-led system designed to log behaviours every time we interact with the connected world. I already knew about my daily records being collected by services such as Google Maps, Search, Facebook, or contactless credit card transactions. But you combine that with public information such as land registry, council tax, or voter records, along with my shopping habits and real-time health and location information, and these benign data sets begin to reveal a lot, such as whether you're optimistic, political, ambitious, or a risk-taker. Even as you're listening to me, you may be sedentary, but your smartphone can reveal your exact location, and even your posture. Your life is being converted into such a data package to be sold on. Ultimately, you are the product. Ostensibly, we're all protected by data protection laws. In the UK, the law states that any personal data set has to be stripped of identifiers such as your name or your National Insurance number. Personal data is considered anything that can be traced directly back to you. without the need for additional information. This doesn't mean it can't be sold on. It only means that they need your permission. Simple examples of personal data include your full credit card number, your bank statement, or a criminal record. However, I discovered that online anonymity is a complete myth. Particulars such as your postcode, your date of birth, and your gender can be traded freely and without your permission because they're not considered personal but pseudonymous. In other words, they can't be traced back to you without the need for additional information. So why does it matter if a bunch of companies you've never heard of know your age or your postcode, you may think. Well, it matters quite a lot. About a decade ago, Latanya Sweeney, a professor of privacy at Harvard University proved that about 87% of US citizens could be uniquely identified by just three facts about them: their zip code, their date of birth, and their gender. In the UK, where we have far fewer citizens serviced by much longer postcodes, that probability is far higher. Professor Sweeney proved this in a rather cheeky way when William Weld, a former governor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the US decided to support the commercial release of 135,000 state employee health records along with their families, including his own. These records did not contain a name or a social security number, but did contain hundreds of fields of sensitive medical information including drugs prescribed, hospitalisations, and procedures performed on these employees. For $20, Professor Sweeney purchased the voter records for Cambridge, Massachusetts, containing the names, zip codes, dates of birth, and gender for every voter in the area, and then cross-referenced this with their health records. Within minutes, she had pinpointed Governor Welds' own health records. Only six people in Cambridge shared his date of birth. Three of them were men. And he was the only one living in his zip code. Professor Sweeney sent the governor his health records in the post. (Laughter) Every day, we hear about new examples of companies digging ever deeper into our personal lives. In the November US presidential election, a little-known British company known as Cambridge Analytica was tasked with winning the election for a certain candidate: Donald Trump, using data analytics. The company employed cookies online to track people around the web, logging every website visited, every search term typed, and every video watched. They also created a viral Facebook quiz to dig into people's personalities, which was taken by over six million people. In total, they managed to amass data on 220 million voting Americans with an average of about 5,000 pieces of data on each person. They then used this data to understand people's inner feelings and then targeted adverts to them on Facebook. Researchers have called them a propaganda machine. It's not just large companies digging into your life; it's free apps and small startups as well. I realised on my phone that every time I logged fitness data into the app Endomondo, it was sharing my details including my location and gender with third-party advertisers. WebMD, a symptom checkers app, was sharing even more sensitive information including the symptoms, procedures, and drugs viewed by users within its app with its third parties. Fitbit was sharing data with Yahoo. A pregnancy tracking app was selling on information about its users' ovulation cycles and fertility cycles with people or advertisers like InMobi. As long as my phone is turned on, my location can be tracked, not just by the obvious apps like Google Maps, but a whole host of unrelated services from Uber to Twitter, Photos, Snapchat, TripAdvisor, and others. You're not even safe in your own home. In 2015, Samsung was found to be recording people in the homes in which their TVs had been sold using their voice recognition systems. They have now adapted this so they only record when the voice recognition is activated.  But the creepy factor remains. Even services like Google and Facebook, trusted and used by billions around the world, have been accused of crossing the line. A few weeks ago, my husband and I were driving home from work and discussing where we should have dinner. I suggested a restaurant that I knew was somewhere on our way back and then opened up Google Maps to plot it. Turns out it was already marked on the map with a little bubble. That sinking feeling of being watched is not unique to me. There have been several anecdotal reports of people being shown adverts based on things and conversations they were having in real life, prompting concerns that Facebook and Google are eavesdropping on people via their personal devices. To piece together what all these companies knew about me, I spoke to a data profiler called Eyeota. Eyeota uses cookies to assign me to thousands of different categories, including my job, how many children I have, and whether I'm likely to buy Star Wars memorabilia. (Laughter) They don't know my name, but they know more about me than my neighbours do. Eyeota also buys information from third parties such as the credit rating agency Experian, which amasses a massive database of 15 different demographic types and 66 lifestyles, all based on people's post codes. Because Eyeota buys this information, it knows that I'm more likely to take taxis home rather than night buses late at night and that I'm very, very unlikely to ever be found in a DIY store. (Laughter) It can then sell this information on to the highest bidder. Sometimes, large data sets can be useful for the public good, for example for the use of health researchers or city and urban planners. But most of this information being collected is sustained by advertisers and traded commercially. In fact, eMarketer has predicted that the online advertising industry, which is based almost completely on data targeting and tracking, will hit an all-time high of 77 billion dollars this year. If you think you don't care about being unmasked, you may want to reconsider. Personalised browser ads may be harmless, but connecting disparate aspects of your life to predict your future behaviour could lead to unexpected consequences. For instance, decisions on whether your child gets to go to a certain university or what price you pay for your home or car insurance premiums could be made based on data  given to third parties that you never intended to, such as your own lifestyle habits or family members' ailments. In 2014, Ross Anderson, a professor of Privacy and Security at Cambridge University found that the NHS had been sharing its hospitals' database, which included details of hospitalisations for every citizen in Britain with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, a body that was researching how likely people are to develop chronic illnesses at certain ages. Of course, this resulted in an increase in health insurance premiums. As the amount of data that is collected increases exponentially, it becomes much easier to identify you. For example, your Fitbit measures our heart rate or your gait patterns and these can be used to estimate things like your height, your weight, or even your gender. These are details that are very hard to mimic or change. The data is no longer about you. It is you. Companies are also starting to predict future behaviours - for example, whether you're a trustworthy driver, a good employee, or a good credit risk, based on things like your social media activity, your health and fitness, or your home energy use. The more the companies know about you - where you live, how many children you have, what your medical ailments are, what you buy - your anonymity becomes irrelevant. What's more, you lose your right to free choice, as companies make decisions on your behalf without your knowledge. Along my journey of discovery, my first reaction was shock. I immediately wrote to my local council and asked them to make my voter records private. I made up a fake email address, and I started registering with a fake age and gender. I turned off targeted advertising, and I asked Facebook to send me all the information that they held on me, including things I had deleted, and spent hours poring over it obsessively. But after a few weeks I realised this was a pointless exercise. I couldn't be a digital hermit. It wasn't realistic for me to stop using social media, search and navigation apps, and my iPhone, all a part of modern life that I cherished and needed. Instead, I realised that the knowledge itself was empowering. Knowing all the different ways in which my data was being shared and collected made me more responsible about where I put it. For example, I stopped signing up to supposedly free services, for example, a VIP card at my local hairdresser or a discount coupon at your supermarket. Whenever I download an app, I make sure to check my settings to see what permissions it has. Anything that seems unnecessary like access to my location, I turn off. Ultimately, there is hope. As more of us begin to realise the extent of our data footprint, we will start to demand custody and control of this data. Some critics have even suggested that people be paid for their data in order to give them more control. This means it will become too expensive for companies, governments, and non-profits to recklessly mine and hold our data, and sell it on indiscriminately But until the data economy matures, and power moves back from the corporation to the individual, I have lost more than my anonymity. I have given up my right to self-determination and free choice. All I have left is my name. Thank you. (Applause)""}"

I\'m being led from checkpoint to checkpoint, and before each door opens, the door behind me slams shut. The lock echoes while I\'m searched and interviewed again. It\'s a maximum security jail, the largest in the country: the Cook County Jail, in Chicago, Illinois. ""I\'m here for the meeting,"" I say again, repeat my credentials. It\'s my first time visiting a jail, and everyone can tell. They take my phone, they take my keys, and they take my little bag of almonds. Almonds! Finally, I\'m left in a room with two men who stare at me as I enter. One is a gang leader, the other is a corrections officer, and each of them is the size of four of me, which basically means I\'m outnumbered eight to one. Their arms are strapped across their chests, flashes of anger in their eyes - I\'m terrified and I\'m thinking, They were worried about my almonds? (Laughter) The heavy door behind me slams shut. It\'s just the three of us now. No one moves. Now, who\'s had the very same experience? (Laughter) But whether you\'re a C-level executive or a spouse or you\'re a part of any kind of team, you probably know this to be true: that one conversation can change everything. So I want you to think of a tough conversation that people around you need to have. You got it? There\'s some issue that\'s holding them back from accomplishing what they want to accomplish. I believe they might be one conversation away from accomplishing that thing but they\'re not having the conversation they need to have, or they\'ve tried and it hasn\'t gone well. I\'ve led some pretty tough conversations in some pretty tough environments: Northern Ireland, the Middle East, corporate boardrooms. I actually have a PhD in leading difficult conversations, and here\'s what I\'ve learned: We\'re not having the conversations we need to have. And that\'s mostly because we\'re afraid; we don\'t want to make things worse. But not having these conversations or having them poorly is really bad. And most of us know this from our work. Some issue arises for a team - it could be a minor issue, but it goes unaddressed. Frustration sets in, communication constricts, tensions rise, trust evaporates, and collaboration is done. Remember, we\'re talking about teams that perform surgeries, land planes, run schools. Many of us are a part of teams that perform crucial functions. We can\'t afford to avoid tough conversations. So that conversation that you thought of that people around you need to have, you can lead that conversation. And I\'m going to give you three simple rules to being vastly more effective in leading it. Wherever you use these rules - at work, at home - people are going to thank you. And then, they\'ll start reaching goals they couldn\'t reach before, and they will come find you and thank you again, and you\'ll benefit because the people around you will be more successful, not miserable, which makes your life better. So, the three rules. Rule number one: move toward the conflict. Most of us don\'t like conflict, but it\'s normal, healthy and totally human. Without conflict, problems hide everywhere - big problems, problems we all want to solve. So, conflict is information, and handled well, conflict is opportunity. So rather than running from it or pretending it\'s not there, move toward it. More on this in a minute. But rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do, pretend you don\'t. Ask questions about people\'s experiences and listen to what they say. Important things will be said because you are listening, and the better you listen, the better the people having the conversation will listen to each other. And finally, rule three: keep quiet. Don\'t panic in the few seconds it takes for people to respond; they just need time. If you\'re jumpy about pauses, they\'ll see that and lose confidence in the conversation. Some of the best breakthroughs I\'ve seen in really difficult conversations have emerged out of a brief period of silence. Don\'t rush in to rescue everyone from that awkward moment. It\'s your job to show them that moment is OK. Now, let me tell you about some tough conversations where these three rules saved the day. We left off in the Cook County Jail, with an inmate population that has at times swelled to above 10,000. It\'s not an easy place to be. But getting released and not winding up back inside is also difficult. Inmates are released into gang territory, often with no way to get home - if they have a home. And the barriers to finding housing, employment and education are such that it\'s no wonder so many returned to the jail again and again, back through the system. So my team convened every stakeholder we could - former gang members, business leaders, corrections officers in the jail, social workers, the sheriff\'s office, clergy - to see if they could start working together. City officials warned me not to bring all of these groups together, but I felt no chance of success without having this tough conversation. Well, the first meeting came, and whatever I tried, nothing worked. The groups wouldn\'t sit next to each other, wouldn\'t even look at each other. The gang leader and the corrections officer I told you about, they were the first to arrive that day. This was the toughest conversation I\'ve ever led. We take a break, and I\'m desperate. I approach that corrections officer, who hasn\'t said a single word all morning, and I just go for it. I charge up to him, and I say, ""Hey, buddy, what do I gotta do to get you to pipe down in there?"" (Laughter) And he looks at me like - (Laughter) And I think I looked at him kind of like - (Laughter) Remember rule number one: move toward the conflict. Miraculously, he doesn\'t squish me. (Laughter) He actually laughs and says, ""Nah, I\'m not much for talking."" But because I had moved toward the conflict and called out the obvious, I had a small opening with him, and the disastrous meeting was about to start again, and I needed something. I needed him. Rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do, pretend you don\'t. So I asked him, ""What do people get wrong about what you do?"" which is another way of asking, How are you misunderstood? I don\'t know. Tell me. Tell me what this is like for you. And his face changes. He looks like a different person. And he says, ""People think that I feel normal about this, keeping people in cages all day. There\'s nothing normal about my job."" Back in the meeting, I ditch my agenda, and I ask the same question again, and I kept my eyes off the business leaders, and I avoided eye contact with the city officials, and I stared down my big buddy until he went for it. He shocked everyone, told them all just what he told me - there\'s nothing normal about my job - and it\'s a huge opening, and now others are ready to share. And because I don\'t know anything, I keep asking questions, and one by one, they all have their chance to describe everything about their day-to-day, minute-to-minute work, which means everyone is getting heard by everyone. My naive questions make it possible for them to hear one another because they\'re not addressing each other head on; they\'re answering my questions, but they\'re all hearing it. Rule number three: keep quiet. Especially when they start talking, it\'s tempting to direct the conversation. I didn\'t interfere, and they opened up collaboration that was unprecedented in Chicago. The guards and the previously incarcerated, business leaders and faith leaders, all bringing their expertise together, joining forces so that inmates would have a mentor waiting for them and a job lined up before their release from jail - all as a result of that conversation. I\'ll give you one more. In Northern Ireland, for 30 years, bombs could rip through restaurants, bars and shops at any moment. Violence was everywhere. Shootings, abductions - people lived in fear. This period is known as ""the Troubles."" I led some tough conversations in Belfast, the epicenter of the fighting. I remember these enormous murals, paintings of masked gunmen, one of them pointing a rifle right down at you as you walked past. My job was to help Protestants and Catholics, Loyalists and Republicans have some very difficult conversations. We moved toward the conflict, rule number one, by recruiting men who had committed acts of political violence. During armed conflict, fighters become heroes, and afterward, they remain influential, so we did everything we could to include them. Now, it would have been easier not to recruit combatants: the atmosphere wouldn\'t have been as charged. But remember: move toward the conflict. Rule number two: you don\'t know anything, and even if you do ... (Audience) Pretend you don\'t. pretend you don\'t. No advice from me, no commentary, no ideas - those are all short cuts, and the point here is to take the long way. The more I asked, the more they shared. The more they shared, the more they listened. And the more they listened, the more they began to accept silence as a part of their experience. Which gets us to rule number three: keep quiet - show them that silence is OK, that it\'s acceptable. And what will happen then is that the group will start to hear new voices. And often it\'s one of these voices that can bring about a breakthrough. And so, in one of these meetings, we suddenly heard from a man who hadn\'t spoken. He shared his experience as a newcomer to Belfast, standing on a bus, exhausted after work, and suddenly being surrounded by a group of men. They came in really close, whispered horrible threats. They trapped him. And he explained how his heart pounded and he just gripped the railing of the bus and waited until it stopped and he could dash out. He had feared for his life that day, he told the group, and he had hoped that immigrating to Northern Ireland from Somalia would have been the end of having to fear for his life. The room fell totally quiet. Everyone heard him. Protestants, Catholics - suddenly it didn\'t matter. ""That\'s unacceptable,"" the first said. ""That\'s not Belfast,"" said the second. ""Not how we want it to be,"" says the third. Now, these are men who have taken lives, who have devastated many families, in some cases their own, and now they start finishing each other\'s sentences about tolerance, inclusion and respect, and this builds and builds in the room until finally, I can\'t resist the irony, and so I announce, ""Well, mission accomplished. Let\'s go to Disneyland!"" And they all turn and stare at me and start laughing, all of them. They laughed hard for minutes, and what that laughter gave way to was a deeper discussion than they\'d ever had before. They talked about what kind of future they all hoped for, for their kids and their grandkids. Now, here\'s the thing. Our man on the bus who experienced that terrifying moment, he might not have spoken if I had avoided the conflict, held forth with my own ideas and rushed to fill every silence. I moved toward the conflict. I didn\'t presume to know, which meant I kept asking questions. And for the most part, I kept quiet. These rules helped him to speak, and these rules helped the group to hear him, and in the end, his story was just what they needed to hear to move forward together. One conversation can change everything. I think of the corrections officer who said there\'s nothing normal about my job, and the opening that created for the group. I think of the moment when he and the gang leader, at the end of that meeting, embraced one another and how powerful they became as partners. I think of the men in Belfast who hid their faces in ski masks to bring great violence into each other\'s lives. Today they know each other\'s faces and first names; they were enemies and they\'re neighbors now. I think of the CEOs and health care leaders and technology innovators I\'ve seen transform their teams and reach their goals, all starting with one conversation. I think of the lives saved, the jobs created, the dreams achieved. So back to your conversation, the one that people around you really need to have, the one that you can lead. It can feel like a concrete maze the size of 72 football fields, but there\'s almost always a way through, and you\'ll find the way through by moving toward the conflict, asking questions and keeping quiet. Conversations create the future. Whether or not we have them and how we have them is up to us. Thank you. (Applause)'}"

Yeah. (Laughter) I\'ve got a lot to say about her conservative politics and her bumpy advocacy, but this, this was cool. Most of you agreed with me. Not all of you, however. Like any woman in the public eye, Caitlyn\'s appearance in particular came under scrutiny. ""Caitlyn Jenner\'s idea of a woman is a cleavage-boosting corset, sultry poses, thick mascara, banter about hair and makeup; nail polish does not a woman make."" ""I feel slammed by the decision to portray Ms. Jenner on the cover of \'Vanity Fair\', as the stereotypical male fantasy of a woman. It\'s sexist, no matter who does it."" ""I fully support Caitlyn Jenner, but I wish she hadn\'t chosen to come out as a sex babe."" These quotations source from Elinor Burkett, Barbara Cohn Schlachet, and Susan Ager, non-trans women with roots in the second wave feminist movement of the 70s and early 80s. Their, perhaps dated, aesthetic preferences of feminist Liberalism clash with femme aesthetics; in this case, trans-femme aesthetics. But if you ask me, hair, makeup and nails don\'t make trans women like me or any women for that matter, bad feminists. Sure, what if Caitlyn had appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in a pantsuit with no makeup, her hair pulled back, arms crossed? I think she would\'ve looked really cool, but would we all have accepted her so readily as a woman? Would she have appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair to begin with? It\'s time for the aesthetics of upwardly mobile feminist respectability to make room for the aesthetics of survival, particularly trans survival. It\'s time to revise what a feminist looks like; especially if hair, makeup, and nails allow her to get jobs, make friends or ride the subway home safely at night. It\'s time to free the femme, because some of us need it or just like it, and that\'s OK. This charming 1979 text is called, ""The transsexual empire: the making of the she-male."" It was written by Elinor Burkett, a second wave radical feminist. The thesis of this text is essentially that: one, trans women aren\'t women; two, trans women are bad for feminist progress. Raymond confesses in the conclusion of the text that she hopes that with enough work, transsexuality - as she calls it - will eventually be morally mandated out of existence. In 1979, shortly after this book was published, Johns Hopkins, the first US medical institution to offer life-saving, gender confirmation surgery, phased out the procedure and dismantled its Gender Identity Committee after coming under fire in this text. Raymond hypothesizes, ""If the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about man-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries?"" I believe that Raymond\'s call for women to break real gender boundaries is a call we should answer. But do we we have to answer with our bodies? Is it our fault, if the dominant, man-made beauty ideals exclude the bodies that most of us were born with? And, is it bad, if we want to do something about that make a couple of changes? Because men are scary pigs, and patriarchy is real. (Applause) If hair, makeup, and nails, hormones even, If those things keep us strong and safe, then, I don\'t know. Does that make us sell-outs or survivors? Speaking of hair and makeup, I love Lana Del Rey! (Laughter) I love her so much. In a 2014 edition of The New Inquiry, my good friend Sarah Nicole Prickett analyzes the pop-star’s image. ""Two years ago, the prevailing male establishment appeared to not like Lana Del Rey one bit. The New York Times\' John Caramanica called her a poser, a meme, and a has-been suggesting that she could only try again after washing off that face paint and mussing up that hair. In other words, Lana Del Rey should have done a better job of passing, of being a \'natural woman.\'"" One, I relate. Are there any trans girls in the room? No? Ah, my stats were wrong. Passing as a natural woman can decide whether I have a good day or a bad day. It sucks, but it is what it is. Number two. Wow. Thirty-five years after the publication of ""The transsexual empire,"" Raymond\'s preferred femme-free aesthetics of second wave feminism have become the mainstream aesthetics expected by the bro-literati of women. Yikes. Prickett continues - Here\'s another picture of Del Rey; Whoops! Should I have shown you that? - that, ""Lana Del Rey\'s rejection of upwardly mobile feminism and/or high-class femininity in favor of fatalistic glamor makes her a gender deserter to some, but a godsend to most. When girls and women are meant to choose chic, studied effortlessness, Lana\'s truth is an alternative, a man-loving woman. Read \'man\' unliterally, as something big and impossible to get out from money, a whole damn country ..."" Under patriarchy, money and country inscribe themselves on women\'s bodies. We look in the mirror, and we ask ourselves, ""Do I look like a rich woman today?"" We look in the mirror and say, ""Do I look like an American woman today?"" We look in the mirror and say, ""Do I look like a beautiful woman today?"" And if I don\'t look rich, beautiful, and American, Am I still a woman? Lana Del Rey and Caitlyn Jenner merely fit the bill we were all charged, and I don\'t blame them for that. If the aesthetics of money and country are, as Prickett argues impossible to get out from, then, why are we being shamed for working it out underneath them? Here\'s a picture of me, before I started transitioning, or I had started transitioning but I hadn\'t started medical transition yet. At this point in my life, I wore a full face of makeup every day, I shaved my whole body every week which covered me in these angry red spots. I stopped cutting my hair. I wore dresses to morning classes. I started hormones: pills twice a day and a needle in my leg every week. I started going in for a monthly laser hair removal appointments, procedures that were so painful, that I had to chug a flask of vodka before every session just so I would feel it less. I starved myself and abused laxatives so I could fit the clothes I wanted to wear. I did all this because I wanted a body that allowed me to do the things I wanted to do in the way I wanted to do them. Things men in this country aren\'t really allowed to do. I tried to do them in the body I was born with, but people told me, ""No, you can\'t. ""You have to soften up your face, get rid of all your body hair; get breasts, shrink your waist, get a vagina."" Of course, I looked them right in the eye said, ""Fuck you,"" turned around, and did pretty much all of what they told me to do. (Laughter) It hurt, and it worked. If my story, or journey sounds difficult or tough, I can guarantee you, it\'s even more difficult and more tough for the vast majority of trans women. In 2002, a trans woman named Gwen Araujo was beaten and strangled to death by four men upon their discovery that Gwen, despite her femme appearance, was not assigned female at birth. In 2013, Islan Nettles was slaughtered under similar circumstances. In 2014, Jennifer Laude was slaughtered under similar circumstances by a US marine. In 2016, January, Monica Loera was slaughtered under similar circumstances. Worldwide, a trans person is slaughtered every three days. The vast majority of these victims are trans women of color, and the vast majority of the discovered murderers are men, dissatisfied with our embodiment of femininity, dissatisfied by trans femininity. Men who judge us to be not femme enough. It is so hard to gain access to hormones to jump through all the medical hoops. It is so expensive to buy cosmetics, new clothes, healthy food, any number of means towards body feminization. Even if a trans woman does manage to look or seem femme, her race, her class, or her citizenship can place further targets on her back. So, when it comes to trans women with limited resources, their femme can be the difference between life and death. So, I got to ask: why are we being shamed for our femme? Let femmes be femmes, if they want to be femme, because some of us need it or just want it, and that\'s OK. When the aesthetics of feminist respectability exclude and erase the women who need, not just want, need to give them up, then the aesthetics of feminist respectability need to change. Femme aesthetics aren\'t bad or good. They just work. They just are. They work for some of us. So, chill out. (Laughter) Let us live. Free the Femme. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause)'}"

The origin of the word robot dates back more than a thousand years to the era of serfdom in central Europe when servitude was the currency for rent. In those days, the Old Church Slavonic word rabota described the forced labor of the people. A slight adjustment of spelling, and rabota became the Czech robota, which, in addition to defining the toil of the serfs, was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery. In 1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called ""R.U.R."", short for ""Rossum\'s Universal Robots."" The story featured automated machines with distinctly human features that, until they revolt, catered to the whims of the people of Earth. Capek originally considered calling these hard-working machines labori from the Latin word for labor, but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly. He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state by naming them roboti, or robot in English. ""R.U.R."" was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923, the word robot was enthusiastically embraced. Though most of today\'s robots look quite different than Capek imagined, they\'ve become just as popular as he predicted.

Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war? As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws.

https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_walker_how_caffeine_and_alcohol_affect_your_sleep,How caffeine and alcohol affect your sleep,"Caffeine wakes you up, and alcohol makes you nod off, right? It's not that simple. Sleep scientist Matt Walker takes us into the eye-opening ways that these drinks affect the quantity and quality of our sleep.",00:04:55,4.916666666666667,93804,2020-07-22T14:12:49+00:00,"['sleep', 'science', 'health', 'human body']","['English', 'Français', 'Nederlands', 'Português brasileiro', 'Türkçe', 'فارسى', 'हिन्दी', 'မြန်မာဘာသာ']",Matt Walker,"Sleep scientist, professor, author","{'00:06': 'Many of us like to start the day with a cup of coffee and perhaps end the day with a glass of wine or some other kind of alcoholic drink. But it turns out that these two substances, alcohol and caffeine, can have surprising impacts on our sleep.', '00:22': '[Sleeping with Science]', '00:25': '(Contemplative music)', '00:27': ""Let's start with caffeine. Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call the psychoactive stimulants. And everyone knows that caffeine can make them more alert. It can wake them up. But there are at least two additional, hidden features of caffeine that some people may not be aware of."", '00:48': ""The first is the duration of action of caffeine. Caffeine, for the average adult, will have what we call a half-life of about five to six hours. What that means is that after about five to six hours 50 percent of that caffeine that you had is still circulating in your system. What that also means is that caffeine has a quarter-life of about 10 to 12 hours. In other words, let's say that you have a cup of coffee at 2pm in the evening. It could be that almost a quarter of that caffeine is still swilling around in your brain at midnight. And as a result, it can make it harder for an individual to fall asleep or even stay asleep soundly throughout the night. So that's the first feature of caffeine."", '01:41': ""The second issue with caffeine is that it can change the quality of your sleep. Now some people will tell me that I'm one of those individuals who can have an espresso with dinner, and I fall asleep fine, and I can stay asleep. But even if that's true, it turns out that caffeine can actually decrease the amount of deep, non-rapid eye movement sleep that we have, stages three and four of non-REM sleep. That's that sort of restorative deep sleep. And as a consequence, you can wake up the next morning, and you don't feel refreshed, you don't feel restored by your sleep. But you don't remember waking up, you don't remember struggling to fall asleep, so you don't make the connection, but nevertheless you may then find yourself reaching for two cups of coffee in the morning to wake up rather than one."", '02:34': ""So that's caffeine, but now let's move on to alcohol, because alcohol is perhaps one of the most misunderstood sleep aids out there. In fact, it's anything but a sleep aid. And it can be problematic for your sleep in at least three different ways."", '02:53': ""First, alcohol is in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives. But sedation is not sleep. And studies teach us that those two things are really quite different. Sedation is a case where we're simply switching off the firing of the brain cells, particularly in the cortex. And that's not natural sleep. In fact, during deep non-rapid eye movement sleep, for example, the brain has this remarkable coordination of hundreds of thousands of cells that all of a sudden fire together, and then they all go silent, and then they all fire together, and then they go silent, producing these big, powerful brainwaves of deep non-REM sleep. And so that's the first way in which alcohol can be problematic. We're mistaking sedation for deep sleep."", '03:46': 'The second problem with alcohol is that it can actually fragment your sleep. Alcohol can actually trigger and activate during sleep what we call the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which will therefore wake you up more frequently throughout the night. And alcohol can even increase the amount of alerting chemicals that are released by the brain, once again fragmenting your sleep.', '04:12': ""The third and final issue with alcohol and sleep is that alcohol can actually block your rapid eye movement sleep, or your dream sleep. And as we'll learn in subsequent episodes, REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, dream sleep, provides a collection of benefits, things such as your emotional and mental health, even creativity."", '04:36': ""Now I'm not here to tell anyone how to live. I don't want to be puritanical. I'm just a scientist. What I want to try and do is provide you with the information about the relationship between caffeine and alcohol on your sleep so then you can make an informed choice as to how best you want to live your life when you're trying to prioritize your sleep health.""}"

And by understanding a little bit more about what sleep is, perhaps we can get the chance to improve both the quantity and the quality of our sleep.', '00:24': '[Sleeping with Science]', '00:26': '(Gentle music)', '00:29': 'So, exactly what is sleep? Well, sleep, at least in human beings, is subdivided into two main types. On the one hand, we have non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM sleep for short. But on the other hand, we have rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep.', '00:48': 'And non-REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages, unimaginatively called stages one through four, increasing in their depth of sleep. And as we go into those light stages of non-REM sleep, your heart rate starts to decrease, your body temperature starts to drop and your electrical brain wave activity starts to slow down.', '01:13': 'But as we move into deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep, stages three and four, now all of a sudden the brain erupts with these huge, big, powerful brain waves. The body is actually recharged in terms of its immune system. We also get this beautiful overhaul of our cardiovascular system. And, in fact, upstairs in the brain, deep non-REM sleep will help consolidate memories and fixate them into the neural architecture of the brain.', '01:45': ""So that's non-REM sleep. But let's come on to REM sleep, which is the other main type of sleep. And it's during REM sleep when we principally have the most vivid, the most hallucinogenic types of dreams. The brain wave activity actually starts to speed up again. It's during REM sleep that we receive almost a form of emotional first aid. And it's also during REM sleep where we get a boost for creativity, that it stitches information together so that we wake up with solutions to previously difficult problems that we were facing."", '02:24': ""Coming back to these two types of sleep, it turns out that non-REM and REM will play out in a battle for brain domination throughout the night, and that cerebral war is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes, and then it's going to be replayed every 90 minutes. And what this produces is a standard cycling architecture of human sleep, a standard 90-minute cycle."", '02:52': ""But what's different, however, is that the ratio of non-REM to REM within those 90-minute cycles changes as we move across the night, such that in the first half the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep, particularly stages three and four of non-REM sleep. But as we push through to the second half of the night, now that seesaw balance actually shifts over, and instead, most of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of a lot more rapid eye movement sleep, or dream sleep, as well as stage-two non-REM sleep, that lighter form of non-REM sleep."", '03:36': ""And it turns out that there are implications for understanding how sleep is structured in this way. Let's take someone who typically goes to bed at 10pm, and they wake up at 6am, so they have an eight-hour sleep window. But this morning, they have to wake up early for an early morning meeting, or they want to get a jump start on the day to get to the gym. And as a consequence, they have to wake up at 4am in the morning, rather than 6am in the morning. How much sleep have they actually lost? Two hours out of an eight-hour night of sleep means that they've lost 25 percent of their sleep. Well, yes and no. They have lost 25 percent of all of their sleep, but because REM sleep comes mostly in the second half of the night and particularly in those last few hours, they may have lost perhaps 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent of all of their REM sleep."", '04:36': ""So there are real consequences to understanding what sleep is and how sleep is structured. And we'll learn all about the benefits of these different stages of sleep and the detriments that happen when we don't get enough of them in subsequent episodes.""}"

A young man is wheeled in before you, lying unconscious on a gurney. He's been shot in the leg and is bleeding profusely. Judging from the entry and exit wounds, as well as the amount of hemorrhaging, the bullet most likely clipped the femoral artery, one of the largest blood vessels in the body. As the young man's doctor, what should you do? Or more precisely, what should you do first?"", '00:41': ""You look at the young man's clothes, which seem old and worn. He may be jobless, homeless, lacking a decent education. Do you start treatment by finding him a job, getting him an apartment or helping him earn his GED? On the other hand, this young man has been involved in some sort of conflict and may be dangerous. Before he wakes up, do you place him in restraints, alert hospital security or call 911? Most of us wouldn't do any of these things. And instead, we would take the only sensible and humane course of action available at the time. First, we would stop the bleeding. Because unless we stop the bleeding, nothing else matters."", '01:26': 'What\'s true in the emergency room is true for cities all around the country. When it comes to urban violence, the first priority is to save lives. Treating that violence with the same urgency that we would treat a gunshot wound in the ER. What are we talking about when we say ""urban violence""? Urban violence is the lethal or potentially lethal violence that happens on the streets of our cities. It goes by many names: street violence, youth violence, gang violence, gun violence. Urban violence happens among the most disadvantaged and disenfranchised among us. Mostly young men, without a lot of options or much hope.', '02:08': ""I have spent hundreds of hours with these young men. I've taught them at a high school in Washington DC, where one of my students was murdered. I've stood across form them in courtrooms in New York City, where I worked as a prosecutor. And finally, I've gone from city to city as a policymaker and as a researcher, meeting with these young men and exchanging ideas on how to make our communities safer. Why should we care about these young men? Why does urban violence matter?"", '02:40': 'Urban violence matters, because it causes more deaths here in the United States than any other form of violence. Urban violence also matters because we can actually do something about it. Controlling it is not the impossible, intractable challenge that many believe it to be. In fact, there are a number of solutions available today that are proven to work. And what these solutions have in common is one key ingredient. They all recognize that urban violence is sticky, meaning that it clusters together among a surprisingly small number of people and places.', '03:18': 'In New Orleans, for instance, a network of fewer than 700 individuals accounts for the majority of the city\'s lethal violence. Some call these individuals ""hot people."" Here in Boston, 70 percent of shootings are concentrated on blocks and corners covering just five percent of the city. These locations are often known as ""hot spots."" In city after city, a small number of hot people and hot spots account for the clear majority of lethal violence. In fact, this finding has been replicated so many times that researchers now call this phenomenon the law of crime concentration.', '03:56': ""When we look at the science, we see that sticky solutions work best. To put it bluntly, you can't stop shootings if you won't deal with shooters. And you can't stop killings if you won't go where people get killed."", '04:13': 'Four years ago, my colleagues and I performed a systematic meta-review of antiviolence strategies, summarizing the results of over 1,400 individual impact evaluations. What we found, again and again, was that the strategies that were the most focused, the most targeted, the stickiest strategies, were the most successful. We saw this in criminology, in studies of policing, gang prevention and reentry. But we also saw this in public health, where targeted tertiary and secondary prevention performed better than more generalized primary prevention. When policymakers focus on the most dangerous people and places, they get better results.', '04:57': ""What about replacement and displacement, you might ask. Research shows that when drug dealers are locked up, new dealers step right in, replacing those that came before. Some worry that when police focus on certain locations, crime will be displaced, moving down the street or around the corner. Fortunately, we know now that because of the stickiness phenomenon, the replacement and displacement effects associated with these sticky strategies are minimal. It takes a lifetime of trauma to create a shooter and decades of disinvestment to create a hot spot. So these people and places don't move around easily."", '05:41': ""What about root causes? Isn't addressing poverty or inequality or lack of opportunity the best way to prevent violence? Well, according to the science, yes and no. Yes, in that high rates of violence are clearly associated with various forms of social and economic disadvantage. But no, in that changes in these factors do not necessarily result in changes in violence, especially not in the short run. Take poverty, for instance. Meaningful progress on poverty will take decades to achieve, while poor people need and deserve relief from violence right now. Root causes also can't explain the stickiness phenomenon. If poverty always drove violence, then we would expect to see violence among all poor people. But we don't see that."", '06:27': 'Instead, we can empirically observe that poverty concentrates, crime concentrates further still and violence concentrates most of all. That is why sticky solutions work. They work, because they deal with first things first. And this is important, because while poverty may lead to violence, strong evidence shows that violence actually perpetuates poverty.', '06:54': ""Here's just one example of how. As documented by Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist -- he showed that when poor children are exposed to violence, it traumatizes them. It impacts their ability to sleep, to pay attention, to behave and to learn. And if poor children can't learn, then they can't do well in school. And that ultimately impacts their ability to earn a paycheck later in life that is large enough to escape poverty."", '07:22': ""And unfortunately, in a series of landmark studies by economist Raj Chetty, that is exactly what we've seen. Poor children exposed to violence have lower income mobility than poor children who grow up peacefully. Violence literally traps poor kids in poverty. That is why it is so important to focus relentlessly on urban violence. Here are two examples of how."", '07:48': 'Here in Boston, in the 1990s, a partnership between cops and community members achieved a stunning 63 percent reduction in youth homicide. In Oakland, that same strategy recently reduced nonfatal gun assaults by 55 percent. In Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Haven, it cut gun violence by more than a third. At its simplest, this strategy simply identifies those who are most likely to shoot or be shot, and then confronts them with a double message of empathy and accountability. ""We know it\'s you that\'s doing the shooting. It must stop. If you let us, we will help you. If you make us, we will stop you."" Those willing to change are offered services and support. Those who persist in their violent behavior are brought to justice via targeted law enforcement action.', '08:44': ""In Chicago, another program uses cognitive behavioral therapy to help teenage boys manage difficult thoughts and emotions, by teaching them how to avoid or mitigate conflicts. This program reduced violent crime arrests among participants by half. Similar strategies have reduced criminal reoffending by 25 to 50 percent. Now Chicago has launched a new effort, using these same techniques, but with those at the highest risk for gun violence. And the program is showing promising results. What's more, because these strategies are so focused, so targeted, they tend not to cost much in absolute terms. And they work with the laws already on the books today."", '09:28': ""So that's the good news. We can have peace in our cities, right now, without big budgets and without new laws. So why hasn't this happened yet? Why are these solutions still limited to a small number of cities, and why do they struggle, even when successful, to maintain support? Well, that's the bad news. The truth is, we have not been very good at organizing our efforts around this phenomenon of stickiness."", '09:59': ""There are at least three reasons why we don't follow the evidence when it comes to urban violence reduction. And the first, as you might expect, is politics. Most sticky solutions don't conform to one political platform or another. Instead, they offer both carrots and sticks, balancing the promise of treatment with the threat of arrest, combining place-based investment with hot-spots policing. In other words, these solutions are both soft and tough at the same time. Because they don't line up neatly with the typical talking points of either the Left or the Right, politicians won't gravitate to these ideas without some education, and maybe even a little pressure. It won't be easy, but we can change the politics around these issues by reframing violence as a problem to be solved, not an argument to be won. We should emphasize evidence over ideology and what works versus what sounds good."", '11:00': ""The second reason why we don't always follow the evidence is the somewhat complicated nature of these solutions. There is an irony here. What are the simplest ways to reduce violence? More cops. More jobs. Fewer guns. These are easy to spell out, but they tend not to work as well in practice. While on the other hand, research-based solutions are harder to explain, but get better results. Right now, we have a lot of professors writing about violence in academic journals. And we have a lot of people keeping us safe out on the street. But what we don't have is a lot of communication between these two groups. We don't have a strong bridge between research and practice. And when research actually does inform practice, that bridge is not built by accident. It happens when someone takes the time to carefully explain what the research means, why it's important and how it can actually make a difference in the field. We spend plenty of time creating research, but not enough breaking it down into bite-sized bits that a busy cop or social worker can easily digest."", '12:12': ""It may be difficult to acknowledge or accept, but race is the third and final reason why more has not been done to reduce violence. Urban violence concentrates among poor communities of color. That makes it easy for those of us who don't live in those communities to ignore the problem or pretend it's not ours to solve. That is wrong, of course. Urban violence is everyone's problem. Directly or indirectly, we all pay a price for the shootings and killings that happen on the streets of our cities. That is why we need to find new ways to motivate more people to cross class and color lines to join this struggle. Because these strategies are not resource-intensive, we don't need to motivate many new allies -- we just need a few. And we just need them to be loud."", '13:04': ""If we can overcome these challenges and spread these sticky solutions to the neighborhoods that need them, we could save thousands of lives. If the strategies I've discussed here today were implemented right now in the nation's 40 most violent cities, we could save over 12,000 souls over the next eight years."", '13:26': 'How much would it cost? About 100 million per year. That might sound like a lot, but in fact, that figure represents less than one percent of one percent of the annual federal budget. The Defense Department spends about that much for a single F-35 fighter jet.', '13:44': ""Metaphorically, the treatment is the same, whether it's a young man suffering from a gunshot wound, a community riddled with such wounds, or a nation filled with such communities. In each case, the treatment, first and foremost, is to stop the bleeding. I know this can work. I know it, because I've seen it. I've seen shooters put down their guns and devote their lives to getting others to do the same. I've walked through housing projects that were notorious for gunfire and witnessed children playing outside. I've sat with cops and community members who used to hate one another, but now work together. And I've seen people from all walks of life, people like you, finally decide to get involved in this struggle. And that's why I know that together, we can and we will end this senseless slaughter."", '14:42': 'Thank you.', '14:43': '(Applause)'}"

(Laughter) But for any of this to make sense, I first need to confess something to you, something that might not be obvious just by looking at me. My name\'s Lucy, and I\'m a sensible grown-up. I work hard. I\'m a decent mother and a responsible member of my community. But I much prefer dressing up as someone else. You see, I have always loved fancy dress. And since this picture - (Laughter) But since this picture was taken, I\'ve ramped things up a bit. I\'ve commissioned made-to-measure armor from a workshop in the Ukraine, imported professional Hollywood blood. I\'ve nurtured a collection of 36 tiaras. I\'ve had a fake wedding, complete with fake bridesmaids, fake vicar, fake husband. I hospitalized myself once after an incident with a Roman toga and some very hot glue. (Laughter) And I once sent my son to school looking like this. (Laughter) Now, the kind of fancy dress that I love is not the same as cosplay with its discipline and immersiveness and accuracy. They\'re the real deal. But what I adore is the peculiar eccentricity of cardboard cut-outs, dodgy sewing, stapled seams. It\'s kitchen-table couture. The for-one-night-only aspect, falling into bed drunk and danced out and still wearing the face paint. And there\'s nothing disciplined about that. So in order to have more fancy dress in my life - because, honestly, it\'s awful - you can\'t do it in supermarkets or on average Wednesdays. So I created a podcast about it. The only podcast about fashion, fantasy, and fancy dress. Or costumes, as they prefer to call it in the US. It\'s a place to explore the elaborate themes, intricacies, and influence of costume in real life. Because I\'m interested in the distinction between the performative and the personal. Ordinary people in extraordinary outfits. And what struck me more than any other subject we\'ve encountered on the show is the way people use costume as a tool for protest. Now, you might be thinking, ""What does dressing up have to do with the important business of politics?"" (Laughter) And it does seem counterintuitive. Why dress silly in order to be taken seriously? But from caped crusaders to modern suffragettes, people are getting creative with costume to express their outrage and garner global attention. And it\'s working. It\'s worth saying here that fashion is often treated as a flimsy, generally female distraction from the real issues of the day, and despite being a three-trillion-dollar industry, it\'s often marginalized or dismissed in commentary about current affairs. And yet, every day each one of us uses what we wear as a tool for constructing our sense of self, for literally fashioning our identities. If fashion is considered frivolous, then fancy dress is really frivolous. Right? But actually, it allows us to express the most extreme version of ourselves. It allows us to be something other. Something in-between, something in development. And historically, it\'s always had a relationship with hot topics. Here\'s a gown by Worth worn by Mrs. Vanderbilt in 1883, representing the spirit of electricity. More recently, there\'s been a decidedly less beautiful trend for dressing as the Millennial\'s favorite, the avocado. (Laughter) Sorry. (Laughter) Over the years, fancy dress has playfully depicted controversial moments, from this matchgirl factory-strike dress to Urban Outfitter\'s Halloween ""Influencer"" costume. It\'s satire and disruption and provocation. So I\'m going to take us beyond slogan T-shirts to look at the ways bonkers subversive garments are being used to take on the establishment. Here, we can see an anarchic continuity from gunpowder plot through to Occupy Wall Street. These masks taken from the comic book ""V for Vandetta,"" are used as a public face of the anonymous movement. They\'re a variation on a Guy Folks theme, and they hark back to ancient carnivals and masquerades where the usual societal rules don\'t apply, and everything is temporarily topsy-turvy. Here, ""Handmaid\'s Tale"" costumes are appropriated for demonstrations against the Trump administration, and we saw a lot at the Kavanaugh hearings - taking a moment in fiction from Margaret Atwood\'s 1985 dystopia, and applying it to a very current conflict, lines of silent, highly visible women outside courtrooms and the Capitol. Hilariously, later, in a complete misjudgment of the cultural mood, the retailer Yandy prompted wide-spread disgust when they launched a sexy version of the Handmaid. (Laughter) I don\'t think they\'d read the novel. (Laughter) Elsewhere, the visual language of the suffragettes is borrowed from new battle, purple for dignity, white for purity, green for hope. Powerful Pantones and a pre-hashtag way of building momentum. Sentiments like ""Same shit, different century"" are rendered ever so lady-like. (Laughter) The campaign group Fathers for Justice uses a range of costumes in their stunts from Batman to Santa. Clear statements in a contentious debate. By using classic icons of good, by hijacking the visual grammar of superheroism, they\'re trying to invoke an almost an instinctive, nostalgic, sympathetic response in the viewer. The Pink Pussyhat Project took a traditional domestic skill and rendered it the opposite of calm or comforting. This open-source knitting pattern, this moment of craftivism - originally conceived the people who wanted to march but couldn\'t - was quickly embraced by women\'s activists all over the world. Sarah Mower called it a global cheerful symbol of feminist defiance in British Vogue, and it\'s considered so important a moment in fashion history that the V&amp;A\'s brilliantly titled Rapid Response Collection have already acquired one. Now, imagine if you took the costumes away in all these examples. If they were just standing there in jeans and anoraks. What does that do the occasion, the atmosphere, the news cycle? Each of these examples uses cultural referencing to make a statement without saying a word. It\'s free speech without speech, the messages writ large on the body. And how do you express your feelings about issues that are so complex, so shifting, so delicate, so divisive that sometimes language eludes even the very best of us? I just love her face in that picture. (Laughter) At a time when the words of experts are ridiculed and critics are trolled, when fake news rebrands truth as fiction, perhaps we need tools that are beyond language to securely assert our values. I think there\'s a link between fancy dress and ambition. It\'s why we love it growing up. You can be a ballet dancer and a firefighter, all in the same afternoon. But for the game to work, you have to do more than just put the clothes on. You need to aspire into those costumes. Fancy dress isn\'t just a tool to passively join in, but an opportunity to project our future selves, our hopes. And I believe there\'s a relationship between the way we dress and how brave we feel. I know that because it took me weeks to decide what to wear today. (Laughter) Perhaps, dressing up gives us courage to behave in ways we wouldn\'t otherwise. Here are some extreme illustrations of that. During the American Civil War, Frances Clayton dressed as a male soldier, becoming Jack Williams. She fought with the Missouri Regiment in 17 battles before her identity was revealed. She used uniform first to disguise her gender, second as armor, a layering of costume that allowed her to elude the male gaze and instead train her eye to fight alongside them. Which, I wonder, was the more dangerous? By wearing her warrior status, Frances was dressing up in order to be allowed in. A whole life born out of those clothes. The women of the 18th century often used the masquerades as an opportunity to elope or escape. Being masked and unchaperoned gave them an unusual freedom, a socially sanctioned moment of disguise to pursue a life beyond the one ascribed to them. The mask made them dangerous and daring. We know how extreme the psychology of this can be because the worst imaginable atrocities have been committed masked and in a kind of costume. A corrupt courage. Cloaked and criminal. A group united as a chilling icon of hatred. Costume isn\'t intrinsically innocent. And a disguise can free an innermost evil, too. Costume for unity can be seen in a completely different way here: where it says, ""She is getting married, so we\'re having organized compulsory fun."" (Laughter) We\'ve all been there. Or here, at the State of the Union, where it says we are part of an empowered tradition honoring the suffragettes\' legacy. Simply put, when an activist puts their identity alongside a placard, they show that they, as an individual, express a view. If they want to connect it with a wider movement, they can use a signifier, like the suffragette colors or the ""hi-viz"" vests of the French ""Gilets jaunes."" It\'s tribal. Whereas in fancy dress, the costume subsumes the individual entirely into the view they\'re expressing. It\'s as if, bizarrely, when someone is concealed, their true values become completely visible. The arresting protest images I\'ve shown you today, and of course there are many more, all, unequivocally, communicate collective hopes. By protesting in costume, these people are giving voice to their democratic right to imagine a potential future, to identify with each other, and to express their freedom. So costume has real potential to challenge and confront, for disruption and dissent. By dressing outside ourselves, we trick the eye, attract the focus, demand recognition. We creatively tell the people in power that we\'re not comfortable conforming, that the collective issue is bigger than our personal perspective. Fancy dress is not bound by who you are or how you identify but by the message you want to embody. And those messages aren\'t constrained by the limits of your experience or your environment. Only by your imagination. And we have to imagine our utopias before we can build them. It is imagination that sells thousands of cheap and cheerful Marilyn Monroe dresses every year. Imagination that sends kids to school clutching Harry Potter wands, and sales figures for grotesque rubber presidential candidate masks have correctly predicted U.S. election outcomes since Nixon. Isn\'t he handsome there? (Laughter) Unlike any other kind of getting dressed, fancy dress is fundamentally about infinite possibility. That\'s why we keep it alive, even when technology offers up far more sophisticated vehicles for experimenting or escapism. We still throw another party, hand down our treasured dressing-up boxes, those time capsules of ideas and interpretations. So if dressing together as one brilliant rainbow crew gives you a sense of strength and belonging, a palette just about big enough to celebrate your pride, then use all the colors. Or if you wake up one morning thinking Brexit is a job for Wonderwoman ... (Laughter) you might be right. Or if you\'re moved to rise up in solidarity in a crowd of pink hats that say in glorious, loving shorthand how your body is equal, how it is not there for grabbing, how it belongs fiercely to yourself, then get knitting. Just as children dressing as astronauts aren\'t trying out a future career, they\'re playing with an alternative reality. So we can use the freedom of fancy dress to communicate an imagined, better version of our lives. Because fancy dress says, ""This tawdry reality isn\'t good enough for me."" Think of it as dressing up for the job you want, not the job you have. Or for turning one night only into a blueprint for a magical tomorrow, too. Lets remember, fancy dress has a grown-up role to play beyond stag parties and Halloweens. Its principles even have a place at the State Opening of Parliament and the State of the Union. From full get-up to subtle signifiers, this is about being emboldened. Massive movements are born of micro demonstrations. Things that seem trivial or frivolous can be potent symbols of what you stand for, or what you won\'t stand for. There\'s real power in putting on those knitted ears, in choosing to wear a cape for good versus evil. Fancy dress has a unifying quality that we can use to fight for change, armed only with glue guns and gumption. And if costume makes up braver, it gives us the courage to explore imaginative alternatives. The courage not just to turn up but to be noticed. So I hope we never grow out of it. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) (Whistles)'}"

However, as neuroscientist and operatic soprano Indre Viskontas points out, we know very little about how the brain turns strings of sounds into music. In a talk that explores art with science, she describes how her investigation into the brain's responses to music inspired her own musical journey.",,,68067,2019-08-19T20:27:21+00:00,"['science', 'music', 'art', 'brain', 'neuroscience']","['English', 'Español', 'Italiano', 'Magyar']",Indre Viskontas,Professor of Neuroscience and of music,"{'0:00': 'Music isn\'t music until your brain makes it so. Sounds can be noise in one context and music in another. We can all tell when someone is speaking vs. when they\'re singing, but as Diana Deutsch discovered if you take a spoken sentence, pull out a phrase, repeat that phrase over and over and over again, it will begin to sound musical. Then, if you listen to the entire sentence again, it will sound as if the person bursts into song when he or she gets to the repeated part. But the sounds reaching your ear are the same in all of those cases; what\'s changed is your brain. How the brain turns sound into music remains one of the greatest mysteries of neuroscience. The vast majority of us love some kind of music; If you don\'t, you are very rare and scientists will want to study you. We call you a person with ""amusia"" - a cool new name. We don\'t all love the same music. Personally, I\'m not a huge fan of smooth jazz, and you might not like opera. This characteristic of music, the fact that it\'s universally loved, but highly subjective, has ensured that it continues to baffle us. We all need certain things to survive and reproduce: food, water, sex. Our minds have evolved in such a way that when we don\'t have those things, we seek them out. They become enjoyable; we call them ""biological reinforcers."" But music is just a bunch of sounds strung together, it doesn\'t provide us with the essential nutrients; it doesn\'t bind to our neurons the way drugs do; it doesn\'t ensure that our genes live on although that might be debatable. Why do we love music? It\'s a question I\'ve struggled to answer, and I can\'t promise you a full, complete solution today, but I like to share with you some of the scientific insights that had made me a better musician, and some of the artistic insights I hope will help neuroscientists solve this mystery. I come from a family of physicians: two anesthesiologists, a gastroenterologist, a generalist, an orthopedic surgeon, an ophthalmic surgeon, and an ER doctor. Thanksgiving dinner at our house is the safest place to be outside of the hospital. (Laughter) so I can\'t guarantee it\'s the most fun. Then there is my mother; she is a conductor, much to my two-year old son\'s dismay, not of the locomotive kind but very much of the music kind. Growing up, I saw how difficult it is to make a living as a musician in a society where music is universally loved but hopelessly undervalued. She works long hours, she still sacrifices every holiday, and there is a part of her that never stops wondering what people thought of her last performance. If you count up all the awards, the recognitions, and distinctions, she\'s by far, the most successful member of our family, but she certainly wouldn\'t think so. Not that being a doctor isn\'t stressful - it is - but at the end of the day, you\'ve spent your time trying to extend or enhance a person\'s life, and who can argue the value of that? So when it was my turn to decide what to do with my professional life, the choice seemed pretty straight forward: go to medical school, and in your free time, continue up your musical training. But then I watched my brother trained to become an orthopedic surgeon, and I realized there is no such thing as free time in med school and especially in the years that follow. I didn\'t want to give up the most important years of my vocal training. I also couldn\'t see how I could support myself and pay for those expensive singing lessons if I didn\'t have some other way to make money. So I turned to neuroscience. To me, it was the a perfect blend of science and poetry. Like pretty much every other neuroscientist of my generation, I devoured the writings of Oliver Sacks; I studied topics like autobiographical memory, analogical reasoning, creativity. So you\'d think then I\'d turn to science to help me become a better musician. After all, if I was using science to understand something as elusive as insight, wouldn\'t it make sense to turn there to learn the things that I loved? But the truth is the more I looked at anatomical drawings of the larynx, the tongue, and the diaphragm, the less I felt I understood about my instrument; I couldn\'t see how knowing what parts of the brain were active or even enhanced in musicians would make me sing better. For a while, I even tried very hard to give up singing, because, after all, there are so many great singers in the world. We all need to get one-on-one care from a physician, but many hundreds of thousands of us can be moved by the same musician. So wouldn\'t I, and maybe the world, be better off if I stuck to medical research? The problem was that the more time I let elapse between singing engagements, the more I felt there was something really important missing from my life. The more I felt that I couldn\'t be the person I needed to be, I became moody, irritable, a little irrational, often mean; and I found too often I would cap off a difficult day in the lab with a martini or two and an hour of self-loathing. So when I finished my neuroscience PhD, I decided to dedicate myself full time to music; I enrolled in a Master\'s of Music program. Classical musical training follows the apprenticeship model where you study with one or two teachers for many years until you can produce the sounds that you hear in your imagination on your instrument. But the one thing that kept gnawing at me over and over again was how little neuroscience had trickled down into this model. After all, most of the techniques are built upon performing the same exercises over and over and over again, often, in the same way, everyday; until you build those skills. To demonstrate this, I want to introduce to you one of my favorite collaborators, Keisuke Nakagoshi. (Applause) Keisuke is going to give us an example of what a typical piano training exercise sounds like. (Piano music starts) (Piano music ends) Over and over and over again! But the truth is if you want to take what you\'re learning, what you\'re developing in that skill, and apply it to any piece of music, research in motor learning suggests that you should in fact interleave and space out your trials introducing some randomness - what we call ""desirable difficulties."" There is even a study of pianists demonstrating this effect, but so many teachers have never heard of such a thing. So then I began to wonder, ""What would happen if I actually try it on myself?"" as most scientists use themselves as guinea pigs, and I found that I started to improve much more rapidly. So I developed a course called Training the Musical Brain; how to use neuroscience to develop more effective practice strategies which I now teach at the Conservatory of Music here in San Francisco. I started to wonder, ""Are there other ways that science can make me a better musician that I couldn\'t see ten years ago?"" When I was a child, I remember one of my evaluations at the Royal Conservatory of Music; it\'ll always stick with me. I was a kid, I sang all my pieces well, I didn\'t make any mistakes, the judges said my tone was very good, I had good technique, but my performance was deemed ""unmusical."" I was devastated. How could these judges gauge my musicality? Couldn\'t they see that I feel and understand this music deeply? But the truth is feeling the music and producing music other people feel are two different skills. In the rehearsal room, I can cry as much as I need to when my character is dying, but when I get on stage, it\'s your time to cry not mine. So what could science tell me about that? That\'s when my two worlds collided; because after all, art and science are after the same thing: the goal is to understand the human experience. Science does it by extracting general principles about the world, and art uses individual experience to highlight what\'s universal. So here is what I learned in a nutshell: your brain is primed to search for meaning, for patterns, in a random, chaotic world. We look for these things everywhere, and we\'ve evolved in such a way that it\'s enjoyable when we make a new connection, when we learn something new, when we understand something meaningful. We find pleasure in it. We see things that are meaningful to us even when they are not there. We see faces everywhere; they are important to us. We anthropomorphize or attribute human-like traits to our pets, or cars, or digital devices. When we hear repeated sounds, and we know what they mean, we call it music. Speech becomes song just by repetition. In fact, repetition is the one quality of music that seems to be common across all cultures and genres, even in the one genre in which it\'s explicitly avoided - we call this classical contemporary music composition."" Elizabeth Margulis found if you artificially insert repetition into these pieces, people find them more enjoyable, more interesting, more likely to be rated as having been composed by a human being rather than a computer. Why? Because repetition signals intention, it frames the pattern, it shows you that there is something meaningful here to listen to. But that\'s not enough to explain a human obsession. After all, music can cause riots, topple governments, raise the hairs on the back of your neck. What can science tell us about that? It turns out that when your brain is enjoying a piece of music that might even give you the chills, it\'s awash with a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine, despite its widespread fame, has actually been undersold in many ways; people think of it as the ""pleasure chemical,"" but that\'s not all it does. A better term for it is the ""salience chemical,"" because it\'s awash in some parts of your brain when you\'re trying to hold important things in mind, when you\'re nauseated, when you want something, when there is a meaning to be found. The way that dopamine\'s awash in the brain while you\'re getting the chills from music is very specific to when and where it happens. There\'s a paper from Robert Zatorre\'s lab at McGill with Valorie Salimpoor, the first author that documents these changes and showed me, finally, what it means to be musical. Even as a master\'s student, I self-doubted my ability to sing musically; it was a bit like being cool: everyone seemed to know what it was and how to do it, but if you even asked the question, it showed that you weren\'t cool. I guess the fact I turned to science for help puts the nail in the coffin of my coolness. (Laughter) Even though in the practice room, I\'d spend almost all my time perfecting my high notes, after all, that\'s what gets you hired. They come at the climax of the piece; they get the biggest reaction from the audience; and if you screw them up, they are the most memorable. But my singing teacher would say to me, ""It\'s all the notes that are leading up to the high note that are more important than the high note, and that\'s what you should practice."" I understood that from a technical perspective but not from a musical one until I read the Salimpoor paper. In the Salimpoor paper, they show that there are two regions of the brain that mediate getting the chills from music and they tracked dopamine in these regions. They are the caudate and the nucleus accumbens. You can think of the caudate as your parent: it tells you that your behavior has consequences, it tracks how the things that you see, hear, observe, and do have outcomes; it sets up the expectation of a reward of pleasure and ensures, in the future, you will behave in such a way that you will seek reward and avoid the things that led to punishment. The caudate is awash with dopamine when you are leading up to the special moment that will give you the chills. But when you get to the moment that give you the chills, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens. Your nucleus accumbens is your BFF, it\'s your best friend for life, because more dopamine in the nucleus accumbens correlates with a bigger high. In the 1950s, Olds and Milner stuck electrodes into the nucleus accumbens of a bunch of rats. Then, they taught those rats to press the lever; and every time they pressed the lever, they\'d get a little electric current that stimulates their nucleus accumbens. Those rats wanted nothing more than to press that lever. One rat pressed it 7,500 times in 12 hours, suggesting that it would starve rather than stop pressing. The nucleus accumbens likes, but the caudate wants. The intensity of the chills that you feel from music depends on how much dopamine there is in your nucleus accumbens, but the number of times you get the chills or, if you get them at all, depends on the amount of dopamine in your caudate. That\'s what I learned, that\'s what it means to be musical. You need to set up the musical intention for your audience so that they will pay attention, so that the caudate will know that there is a reward to be had, and we better pay attention. Then, as a musician, you use all kinds of tools, once you\'ve set up the tension, to delay it, to delay the release. There\'s all kinds of music tools you can use to increase the desire, the expectation, the motivation for the reward, because, after all, pleasure is the death of desire. But the more desire there is, the better the pleasure. That\'s what I learned. So let me demonstrate to you this little theory in practice. One of my favorite opera is ""La Traviata"" by Verdi. It tells the story of a Parisian courtesan, a high class prostitute, who is dying of tuberculosis, as lots of sopranos do. (Laughter) She is entertaining a lavish party because she\'s giving everybody pleasure. That\'s what she does for a living, she gives pleasure, and she gets exhausted by the party; but at the party, she meets this young man who has been sitting outside her window while she was ill, unable to give pleasure when all her friends had abandoned her, and he was waiting for her because he really loved her. And now, alone in her room, she wonders, ""What would it be like to feel true love?"" ""What is this mysterious thing, this pulse of the universe?"" She realizes that it\'s a double-edged sword, that love is both torture and delight, (Italian) ""croce e delizia."" That\'s the intention I want to communicate to you, musically, because, of course, the idea is much more complicated than we can say. In order to do that, I\'ll first sing a repeat of what the tenor\'s saying earlier in the act. Clever Verdi! We like things better the second time around; repetition. Then I will set up the expectation, I\'ll tell you straight off, there will be a high note - Setting that up? - but I will delay that high note as long as possible to increase your motivation to get dopamine into your caudates, so that by the time we relax that tension, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens.
