How are you?', '00:14': '(Audience) Good.', '00:15': "It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving.", '00:21': '(Laughter)', '00:27': "There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.", '00:54': "I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.", '01:10': '(Laughter)', '01:14': "If you work in education, you're not asked.", '01:16': '(Laughter)', '01:19': 'And you\'re never asked back, curiously. That\'s strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They\'re like, "Oh my God. Why me?"', '01:33': '(Laughter)', '01:35': '"My one night out all week."', '01:37': '(Laughter)', '01:39': "But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.", '02:22': "And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.", '02:55': 'So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.', '03:08': '(Applause)', '03:09': 'Thank you.', '03:10': '(Applause)', '03:15': 'That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.', '03:17': '(Laughter)', '03:19': 'So, 15 minutes left.', '03:21': '(Laughter)', '03:24': '"Well, I was born ... "', '03:26': '(Laughter)', '03:29': 'I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, "What are you drawing?" And the girl said, "I\'m drawing a picture of God." And the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like." And the girl said, "They will in a minute."', '03:54': '(Laughter)', '04:06': 'When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.', '04:11': '(Laughter)', '04:12': "If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?", '04:19': '(Laughter)', '04:20': 'No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.', '04:24': '(Laughter)', '04:25': '"Nativity II." But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: "James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter) He didn\'t have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, "You OK with that?" They said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, "I bring you gold." And the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh." And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."', '05:07': '(Laughter)', '05:20': "What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.", '06:03': "Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this?", '06:21': 'I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was.', '06:30': '(Laughter)', '06:31': "Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?", '06:53': '(Laughter)', '07:00': 'How annoying would that be?', '07:01': '(Laughter)', '07:09': '"Must try harder."', '07:10': '(Laughter)', '07:15': 'Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!" To William Shakespeare. "And put the pencil down!"', '07:20': '(Laughter)', '07:21': '"And stop speaking like that."', '07:23': '(Laughter)', '07:26': '"It\'s confusing everybody."', '07:28': '(Laughter)', '07:33': "Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month.", '07:55': '(Laughter)', '07:57': 'Mind you, they\'d had their fourth anniversary, because it\'s a long time when you\'re 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, "I\'ll never find another girl like Sarah." And we were rather pleased about that, frankly --', '08:08': '(Laughter)', '08:16': 'because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.', '08:19': '(Laughter)', '08:25': "But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?", '09:08': '(Laughter)', '09:12': 'Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.', '09:21': 'If you were to visit education as an alien and say "What\'s it for, public education?" I think you\'d have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you\'d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn\'t it? They\'re the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.', '09:47': '(Laughter)', '09:51': "And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.", '10:19': '(Laughter)', '10:25': "Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings.", '10:29': '(Laughter)', '10:34': 'If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night.', '10:44': '(Laughter)', '10:47': 'And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.', '10:52': '(Laughter)', '10:55': 'Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it.', '10:58': '(Laughter)', '11:00': "Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.", '11:17': 'Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? "Don\'t do music, you\'re not going to be a musician; don\'t do art, you won\'t be an artist." Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.', '11:39': "And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.", '12:05': "In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.", '12:22': "Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly.", '12:34': '(Laughter)', '12:36': "But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.", '12:54': "We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.", '13:32': "By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully.", '13:54': '(Laughter)', '13:57': "No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling --", '14:04': '(Laughter)', '14:05': 'she\'s doing open-heart surgery over here. If I\'m cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone\'s on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, "Terry, please, I\'m trying to fry an egg in here."', '14:16': '(Laughter)', '14:23': '"Give me a break."', '14:25': '(Laughter)', '14:26': 'Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, "If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, "If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"', '14:41': '(Laughter)', '14:49': 'And the third thing about intelligence is, it\'s distinct. I\'m doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany," which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I\'m fascinated by how people got to be there. It\'s really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She\'s a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera." She\'s wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.', '15:18': '(Laughter)', '15:20': 'Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the \'30s, wrote to her parents and said, "We think Gillian has a learning disorder." She couldn\'t concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they\'d say she had ADHD. Wouldn\'t you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn\'t been invented at this point. It wasn\'t an available condition.', '15:44': '(Laughter)', '15:47': "People weren't aware they could have that.", '15:49': '(Laughter)', '15:52': 'Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, "I\'ve listened to all these things your mother\'s told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We\'ll be back. We won\'t be very long," and they went and left her.', '16:25': 'But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, "Just stand and watch her." And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, "Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn\'t sick. She\'s a dancer. Take her to a dance school."', '16:49': 'I said, "What happened?" She said, "She did. I can\'t tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn\'t sit still, people who had to move to think." Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She\'s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she\'s given pleasure to millions, and she\'s a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.', '17:30': '(Applause)', '17:38': "What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.", '18:11': 'There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, "If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish." And he\'s right.', '18:31': "What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.", '19:03': 'Thank you very much.', '19:04': '(Applause)'}, 'page_html': None}{'video_url': 'https://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_this_is_what_happens_when_you_reply_to_spam_email', 'title': 'This is what happens when you reply to spam email', 'description': 'Suspicious emails: unclaimed insurance bonds, diamond-encrusted safe deposit boxes, close friends marooned in a foreign country.

But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller? Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter) I see you. So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now. We're going to come back to that in a few minutes, and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit, it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.", '00:47': "So, we're really fascinated with body language, and we're particularly interested in other people's body language. You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake.", '01:11': 'Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10. This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States. Here comes the Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause)', '01:24': '(Laughter) (Applause)', '01:27': "Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake, can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks. Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we think about communication. When we think about communication, we think about interactions. So what is your body language communicating to me? What's mine communicating to you?", '01:53': "And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language, or other people's body language, on judgments. And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language. And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date. For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued. So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent, but do we like that person and how they interacted? Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes, and even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation. If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?", '03:08': "So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others, how they judge us and what the outcomes are. We tend to forget, though, the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves. We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.", '03:26': "So what nonverbals am I talking about? I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics. I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.", '03:45': "And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance? Well, this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding. So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening up. It's about opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. And humans do the same thing. (Laughter) So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically, and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment. And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are. This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they cross the finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it. They do this. So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.", '04:44': "What do we do when we feel powerless? We do exactly the opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up. We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us. So again, both animals and humans do the same thing. And this is what happens when you put together high and low power. So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them.", '05:13': "So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down, they're sort of spread out. They raise their hands like this. You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it. You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand.", '05:52': "I notice a couple of things about this. One, you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender. So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising.", '06:08': 'But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating. And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade.', '06:22': "So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades, and it seems to be partly attributable to participation. So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more?", '06:46': "So my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it? Like, can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful? So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence. But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?", '07:13': "There's some evidence that they do. So, for example, we smile when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power, it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful.", '07:46': "So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds? And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about? So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like? So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident, more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance. They also tend to be able to think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people. Physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.", '08:46': "So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol. So what does that mean? When you think about power, people tended to think only about testosterone, because that was about dominance. But really, power is also about how you react to stress. So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive? Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.", '09:26': 'So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly, within a few days, that individual\'s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes can shape the mind. So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level, like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention? "For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this, and it\'s going to make you feel more powerful."', '10:08': 'So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses or low-power poses, and I\'m just going to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two. So here\'s one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media. Here are a couple more. So you can be standing or you can be sitting. And here are the low-power poses. So you\'re folding up, you\'re making yourself small. This one is very low-power. When you\'re touching your neck, you\'re really protecting yourself.', '10:52': 'So this is what happens. They come in, they spit into a vial, for two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this." They don\'t look at pictures of the poses. We don\'t want to prime them with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items, and then we give them an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample. That\'s it. That\'s the whole experiment.', '11:17': "So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, we find that when you are in the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low-power pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference.", '11:33': "Here's what we find on testosterone. From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase, and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease. So again, two minutes, and you get these changes. Here's what you get on cortisol. High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease, and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase. So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right? So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves. Also, our bodies change our minds.", '12:25': "But the next question, of course, is, can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways? This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this? Which we cared about, of course. And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations, like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends? For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through, was the job interview.", '13:10': 'So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right?', '13:18': '(Laughter)', '13:19': 'You know, so we were of course horrified, and said, Oh my God, no, that\'s not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons, no, don\'t do that. Again, this is not about you talking to other people. It\'s you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this. You\'re sitting down. You\'re looking at your iPhone -- or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out. You\'re looking at your notes, you\'re hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes. So that\'s what we want to test. Okay? So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview. It\'s five minutes long. They are being recorded. They\'re being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback, so they look like this. Imagine this is the person interviewing you. So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It\'s what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand." So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened. We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them. They\'re blind to the hypothesis. They\'re blind to the conditions. They have no idea who\'s been posing in what pose, and they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, "We want to hire these people," all the high-power posers. "We don\'t want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall." But what\'s driving it? It\'s not about the content of the speech. It\'s about the presence that they\'re bringing to the speech. Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech? How good is it? What are their qualifications? No effect on those things. This is what\'s affected. These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves, basically. They\'re bringing themselves. They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no, you know, residue over them. So this is what\'s driving the effect, or mediating the effect.', '15:24': 'So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, "It feels fake." Right? So I said, fake it till you make it. It\'s not me. I don\'t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. I don\'t want to feel like an impostor. I don\'t want to get there only to feel like I\'m not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I\'m not supposed to be here.', '15:55': 'When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident. I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I had been withdrawn from college, and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations, which was very traumatic. I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child. So I\'m taken out of college, I keep trying to go back. They say, "You\'re not going to finish college. Just, you know, there are other things for you to do, but that\'s not going to work out for you."', '16:32': "So I really struggled with this, and I have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that. So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked.", '16:51': 'Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers, and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske, to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That\'s it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, "I\'m quitting." She was like, "You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you\'re staying. You\'re going to stay, and this is what you\'re going to do. You are going to fake it. You\'re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You\'re just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you\'re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, \'Oh my gosh, I\'m doing it. Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.\'" So that\'s what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know, I\'m at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I\'m at Harvard, I\'m not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, "Not supposed to be here."', '17:56': 'So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, "Look, you\'ve gotta participate or else you\'re going to fail," came into my office. I really didn\'t know her at all. She came in totally defeated, and she said, "I\'m not supposed to be here." And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don\'t feel like that anymore. I don\'t feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling. And the second was, she is supposed to be here! Like, she can fake it, she can become it.', '18:35': 'So I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here! And tomorrow you\'re going to fake it, you\'re going to make yourself powerful, and, you know --', '18:43': '(Applause)', '18:48': 'And you\'re going to go into the classroom, and you are going to give the best comment ever." You know? And she gave the best comment ever, and people turned around and were like, oh my God, I didn\'t even notice her sitting there. (Laughter)', '19:03': "She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.", '19:22': "The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this. Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. So, this is two minutes. Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes. Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation, for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator, in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors. That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation. Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down. Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am. Leave that situation feeling like, I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am.", '19:59': "So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing, and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple. I don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter) Give it away. Share it with people, because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. Give it to them because they can do it in private. They need their bodies, privacy and two minutes, and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.", '20:30': 'Thank you.', '20:31': '(Applause)'}, 'page_html': None}{'video_url': 'https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action', 'title': 'How great leaders inspire action', 'description': 'Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership -- starting with a golden circle and the question: "Why?"

They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded -- and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it.

And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle.", '01:56': 'Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren\'t. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by "why" I don\'t mean "to make a profit." That\'s a result. It\'s always a result. By "why," I mean: What\'s your purpose? What\'s your cause? What\'s your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it\'s obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicate from the inside out.', '03:02': 'Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they\'re easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: "We make great computers. They\'re beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?" "Meh." That\'s how most of us communicate. That\'s how most marketing and sales are done, that\'s how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we\'re different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. Here\'s our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients. Here\'s our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it\'s uninspiring.', '03:49': 'Here\'s how Apple actually communicates. "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?" Totally different, right? You\'re ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don\'t buy what you do; people buy why you do it.', '04:24': "This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. As I said before, Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact, they tried. A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs. They've been making flat-screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company? But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.", '05:36': 'Here\'s the best part: None of what I\'m telling you is my opinion. It\'s all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, from the top down, the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the "what" level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It\'s also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.', '06:24': 'In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn\'t drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out, we\'re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn\'t feel right." Why would we use that verb, it doesn\'t "feel" right? Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn\'t control language. The best we can muster up is, "I don\'t know. It just doesn\'t feel right." Or sometimes you say you\'re leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you, those aren\'t other body parts controlling your behavior. It\'s all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.', '07:18': "But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.", '08:03': 'Most people don\'t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success. Even now, you ask people, "Why did your product or why did your company fail?" and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions. It\'s always the same three things, so let\'s explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we\'ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?', '09:04': "A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur. And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.", '09:27': "The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold, look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before supper.", '10:08': 'And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, "That\'s an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn\'t. He wasn\'t first, he didn\'t get rich, he didn\'t get famous, so he quit.', '10:39': "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.", '10:47': "But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe? Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law, you know the terminology. The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators. The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters. The next 34% are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.", '11:17': '(Laughter)', '11:19': 'We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips. I love asking businesses, "What\'s your conversion on new business?" They love to tell you, "It\'s about 10 percent," proudly. Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers. We all have about 10% who just "get it." That\'s how we describe them, right? That\'s like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."', '11:54': 'The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don\'t get it? So it\'s this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" -- because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they\'re comfortable making those gut decisions. They\'re more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat-screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard. And, by the way, they didn\'t do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves. It\'s because they wanted to be first. People don\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: they were first. People don\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.', '13:16': "So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First, the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute. They were extremely well-funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean, we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.", '13:54': '(Laughter)', '13:56': "But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10. In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.", '14:12': 'Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking." And the cynical majority said, "We don\'t believe you. We don\'t need it. We don\'t like it. You\'re scaring us."', '14:36': 'What if they had said, "If you\'re the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc." People don\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.', '15:00': 'Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that? Well, Dr. King wasn\'t the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn\'t the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America. In fact, some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn\'t go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. "I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people. And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.', '16:05': "How many of them showed up for him? Zero. They showed up for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white: 25% of the audience was white.", '16:27': 'Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed, not for him, but for ourselves. By the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech.', '16:56': '(Laughter)', '17:00': 'Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans. They\'re not inspiring anybody. Because there are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us. Whether they\'re individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.

And she called, and she said, "I\'m really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer." And I thought, "Well, what\'s the struggle?" And she said, "Well, I saw you speak, and I\'m going to call you a researcher, I think, but I\'m afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they\'ll think you\'re boring and irrelevant."', '00:25': '(Laughter)', '00:26': 'And I was like, "Okay." And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk is you\'re a storyteller. So I think what I\'ll do is just call you a storyteller." And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, "You\'re going to call me a what?" And she said, "I\'m going to call you a storyteller." And I was like, "Why not \'magic pixie\'?"', '00:45': '(Laughter)', '00:48': 'I was like, "Let me think about this for a second." I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I\'m a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that\'s what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I\'m just a storyteller. And so I said, "You know what? Why don\'t you just say I\'m a researcher-storyteller." And she went, "Ha ha. There\'s no such thing."', '01:14': '(Laughter)', '01:16': "So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent.", '01:34': 'And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, "Here\'s the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist." And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely." And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor\'s and a master\'s in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life\'s messy, love it." And I\'m more of the, "life\'s messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."', '02:17': '(Laughter)', '02:19': 'And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings in social work is, "Lean into the discomfort of the work." And I\'m like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A\'s. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see.', '02:57': "So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologically that's how we're wired -- it's why we're here.", '03:28': 'So I thought, you know what, I\'m going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one "opportunity for growth?"', '03:41': '(Laughter)', '03:43': "And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection.", '04:07': "So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?", '04:40': 'The things I can tell you about it: It\'s universal; we all have it. The only people who don\'t experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this "I\'m not good enough," -- which, we all know that feeling: "I\'m not blank enough. I\'m not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough." The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.', '05:20': "And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well.", '05:47': '(Laughter)', '05:49': "You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research.", '06:04': "My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.", '06:56': "There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those.", '07:40': 'What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that\'s another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted." These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What\'s the theme? What\'s the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I\'m just writing and in my researcher mode.', '08:28': 'And so here\'s what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it\'s from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can\'t practice compassion with other people if we can\'t treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection.', '09:28': 'The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn\'t talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They\'re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental.', '10:32': 'I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown --', '11:01': '(Laughter)', '11:06': '-- which actually looked more like this.', '11:09': '(Laughter)', '11:11': 'And it did.', '11:13': 'I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.', '11:16': '(Laughter)', '11:17': 'A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?" Because about five of my friends were like, "Wooo, I wouldn\'t want to be your therapist."', '11:36': '(Laughter)', '11:39': 'I was like, "What does that mean?" And they\'re like, "I\'m just saying, you know. Don\'t bring your measuring stick."', '11:46': '(Laughter)', '11:49': 'I was like, "Okay." So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, "How are you?" And I said, "I\'m great. I\'m okay." She said, "What\'s going on?" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.', '12:16': '(Laughter)', '12:18': 'And so I said, "Here\'s the thing, I\'m struggling." And she said, "What\'s the struggle?" And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it\'s also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help." And I said, "But here\'s the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."', '12:53': '(Laughter)', '12:55': '"I just need some strategies."', '12:58': '(Laughter)', '13:02': '(Applause)', '13:05': 'Thank you. So she goes like this.', '13:12': '(Laughter)', '13:14': 'And then I said, "It\'s bad, right?" And she said, "It\'s neither good nor bad."', '13:20': '(Laughter)', '13:22': '"It just is what it is." And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."', '13:27': '(Laughter)', '13:30': "And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.", '13:48': '(Laughter)', '13:51': 'For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back.', '14:03': 'And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.', '14:23': 'So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability -- when we\'re waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, "How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what\'s out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I\'m sick, and we\'re newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.', '15:12': "And I think there's evidence -- and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause -- We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.", '15:52': '(Laughter)', '15:54': "I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God.", '16:03': '(Laughter)', '16:05': "You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle.", '16:35': 'One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn\'t just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that\'s uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. "I\'m right, you\'re wrong. Shut up." That\'s it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There\'s no discourse anymore. There\'s no conversation. There\'s just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there\'s anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn\'t work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.', '17:32': '(Laughter)', '17:35': 'Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."', '17:39': '(Laughter)', '17:41': 'And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They\'re hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, "Look at her, she\'s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh." That\'s not our job. Our job is to look and say, "You know what? You\'re imperfect, and you\'re wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging." That\'s our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we\'ll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn\'t have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate -- whether it\'s a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we\'re doing doesn\'t have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... "We\'re sorry. We\'ll fix it."', '18:50': 'But there\'s another way, and I\'ll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there\'s no guarantee -- and that\'s really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that\'s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we\'re wondering, "Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, "I\'m just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I\'m alive." And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we\'re enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, "I\'m enough" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we\'re kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we\'re kinder and gentler to ourselves.', '19:54': "That's all I have.

That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.", '00:25': "Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes. Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic.", '01:08': "Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all. In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.", '01:39': "We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people. Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers. But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there to look at treatment approaches. No one to look at the diagnostics. No one to figure out what tools should be used. As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them. But that was never tried.", '02:41': "So there was a lot that was missing. And these things are really a global failure. The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about. Now, in the movies it's quite different. There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.", '03:10': "The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year. About 10,000 people died,  and nearly all were in the three West African countries. There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers. They found the people and they prevented more infections. The second is the nature of the virus. Ebola does not spread through the air. And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden. Third, it didn't get into many urban areas. And that was just luck. If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger.", '04:05': "So next time, we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.", '04:27': "In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly. And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned.", '04:52': "But in fact, we can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. And we need preparedness.", '05:29': 'The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war. For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go. We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers. NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly. NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained? Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies? So they are absolutely ready to go. So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.', '06:01': "What are the key pieces? First, we need strong health systems in poor countries. That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines. But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on. We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise. And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas. We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are. The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well. So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0. Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly.", '07:09': "Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm. The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe.", '07:43': "So I think this should absolutely be a priority. There's no need to panic. We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.", '07:57': "In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.

I\'m Sam, and I just turned 17. A few years ago, before my freshman year in High School, I wanted to play snare drum in the Foxboro High School Marching Band, and it was a dream that I just had to accomplish. But each snare drum and harness weighed about 40 pounds each, and I have a disease called Progeria. So just to give you an idea, I weigh only about 50 pounds. So, logistically, I really couldn\'t carry a regular sized snare drum, and because of this the band director assigned me to play pit percussion during the halftime show. Now pit percussion was fun. It involved some really cool auxiliary percussion instruments, like the bongos, timpani, and timbales, and cowbell. So it was fun, but it involved no marching, and I was just so devastated. However, nothing was going to stop me from playing snare drum with the marching band in the halftime show. So my family and I worked with an engineer to design a snare drum harness that would be lighter, and easier for me to carry. So after continuous work, we made a snare drum apparatus that weighs only about 6 pounds. (Applause) I just want to give you some more information about Progeria. It affects only about 350 kids today, worldwide. So it\'s pretty rare, and the effects of Progeria include: tight skin, lack of weight gain, stunted growth, and heart disease. Last year my Mom and her team of scientists published the first successful Progeria Treatment Study, and because of this I was interviewed on NPR, and John Hamilton asked me the question: "What is the most important thing that people should know about you?" And my answer was simply that I have a very happy life. (Applause) So even though there are many obstacles in my life, with a lot of them being created by Progeria, I don\'t want people to feel bad for me. I don\'t think about these obstacles all the time, and I\'m able to overcome most of them anyway. So I’m here today, to share with you my philosophy for a happy life. So, for me, there are 3 aspects to this philosophy. So this is a quote from the famous Ferris Bueller. The first aspect to my philosophy is that I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do because there is so much I can do. Now people sometimes ask me questions like, "Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?" or "What daily challenges of Progeria do you face?" And I’d like to say that, even though I have Progeria, most of my time is spent thinking about things that have nothing to do with Progeria at all. Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore the negative aspects of these obstacles. When I can’t do something like run a long distance, or go on an intense roller coaster, I know what I’m missing out on. But instead, I choose to focus on the activities that I can do through things that I’m passionate about, like scouting, or music, or comic books, or any of my favorite Boston sports teams. Yeah, so -- (Laughter) However, sometimes I need to find a different way to do something by making adjustments, and I want to put those things in the "can do" category. Kind of like you saw with the drum earlier. So here’s a clip with me playing Spider-Man with the Foxboro High School Marching Band at halftime a couple of years ago. (Video) ♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫ (Applause) Thank you. All right, all right, so -- That was pretty cool, and so I was able to accomplish my dream of playing snare drum with the marching band, as I believe I can do for all of my dreams. So hopefully, you can accomplish your dreams as well, with this outlook. The next aspect to my philosophy is that I surround myself with people I want to be with, people of high quality. I’m extremely lucky to have an amazing family, who have always supported me throughout my entire life. And I’m also really fortunate to have a really close group of friends at school. Now we’re kind of goofy, a lot of us are band geeks, but we really enjoy each other’s company, and we help each other out when we need to. We see each other for who we are on the inside. So this is us goofing off a little bit. So we’re juniors in High School now, and we can now mentor younger band members, as a single collective unit. What I love about being in a group like the band, is that the music that we make together, is true, is genuine, and it supersedes Progeria. So I don’t have to worry about that when I’m feeling so good about making music. But even having made a documentary, going on TV a couple of times, I feel like I’m at my highest point when I’m with the people that surround me every day. They provide the real positive influences in my life, as I hope I can provide a positive influence in theirs as well. (Applause) Thank you. So the bottom line here, is that I hope you appreciate and love your family, love your friends, for you guys, love you Bro’s and acknowledge your mentors, and your community, because they are a very real aspect of everyday life, they can make a truly significant, positive impact. The third aspect to the philosophy is, Keep moving forward. Here’s a quote by a man you may know, named Walt Disney, and it’s one of my favorite quotes. I always try to have something to look forward to. Something to strive for to make my life richer. It doesn’t have to be big. It could be anything from looking forward to the next comic book to come out, or going on a large family vacation, or hanging out with my friends, to going to the next High School football game. However, all of these things keep me focused, and know that there’s a bright future ahead, and may get me through some difficult times that I may be having. Now this mentality includes staying in a forward thinking state of mind. I try hard not to waste energy feeling badly for myself, because when I do, I get stuck in a paradox, where there’s no room for any happiness or any other emotion. Now, it’s not that I ignore when I’m feeling badly, I kind of accept it, I let it in, so that I can acknowledge it, and do what I need to do to move past it. When I was younger, I wanted to be an engineer. I wanted to be an inventor, who would catapult the world into a better future. Maybe this came from my love of Legos, and the freedom of expression that I felt when I was building with them. And this was also derived from my family and my mentors, who always make me feel whole, and good about myself. Now today my ambitions have changed a little bit, I’d like to go into the field of Biology, maybe cell biology, or genetics, or biochemistry, or really anything. This is a friend of mine, who I look up to, Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, and this is us at TEDMED last year, chatting away. I feel that no matter what I choose to become, I believe that I can change the world. And as I’m striving to change the world, I will be happy. About four years ago, HBO began to film a documentary about my family and me called “Life According to Sam”. That was a pretty great experience, but it was also four years ago. And like anyone, my views on many things have changed, and hopefully matured, like my potential career choice. However, some things have stayed the same throughout that time. Like my mentality, and philosophy towards life. So I would like to show you a clip of my younger self from the film, that I feel embodies that philosophy. (Video) I know more about it genetically. So it’s less of an embodiment now. It used to be like this thing that prevents me from doing all this stuff, that causes other kids to die, that causes everybody to be stressed, and now it’s a protein that is abnormal, that weakens the structure of cells. So, and it takes a burden off of me because now I don’t have to think about Progeria as an entity. Okay, pretty good, huh? (Applause) Thank you. So, as you can see I’ve been thinking this way for many years. But I’d never really had to apply all of these aspects of my philosophy to the test at one time, until last January. I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold, and I was in the hospital for a few days, and I was secluded from all of the aspects of my life that I felt made me, me, that kind of gave me my identity. But knowing that I was going to get better, and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again, helped me to keep moving forward. And sometimes I had to be brave, and it wasn’t always easy. Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave isn’t supposed to be easy. And for me, I feel it’s the key way to keep moving forward. So, all in all, I don’t waste energy feeling bad for myself. I surround myself with people that I want to be with, and I keep moving forward. So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, can have a very happy life as well. Oh, wait, hang on a second, one more piece of advice –- (Laughter) Never miss a party if you can help it. My school’s homecoming dance is tomorrow night, and I will be there. Thank you very much.

Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives.', '04:48': 'Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn\'t that interesting." The Harvard men never ask that question.', '04:59': '(Laughter)', '05:08': 'To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don\'t just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it\'s about time."', '05:38': '(Laughter)', '05:39': "So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.", '06:11': "We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.", '07:07': "And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.", '07:45': "Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain.", '08:52': "And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.", '09:49': "So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community.", '11:09': "So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60. What might leaning in to relationships even look like?", '11:19': "Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges.", '11:52': 'I\'d like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: "There isn\'t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that."', '12:22': 'The good life is built with good relationships.', '12:27': 'Thank you.', '12:28': '(Applause)'}, 'page_html': None}{'video_url': 'https://www.ted.com/talks/graham_shaw_why_people_believe_they_can_t_draw', 'title': "Why people believe they can't draw", 'description': "Most people think they can't draw, but communications expert Graham Shaw isn't buying it.

I\'ve got a question for you: how many people here would say they can draw? (Laughter) I think we\'ve got about one or two percent of the hands going up, and it\'s interesting, isn\'t it? It\'s a little bit like people think of spelling or singing. They think,"You can either do it, or you can\'t." But I think you can. Because when people say they can\'t draw, I think it\'s more to do with beliefs rather than talent and ability. So I think when you say you can\'t draw, that\'s just an illusion, and today I\'d like to prove that to you. When I say "draw", I\'m not saying we\'re all going to draw like Michelangelo. We are not going to be painting the Sistine Chapel\'s ceiling. But would you be happy if, by the end of this session, you could draw pictures a little bit like this? (Audience murmuring) Oh, yes! (Laughter) Or even a little bit like this? (Laughter) Actually, there are only two things you need to do to be able to achieve this. One is have an open mind. Are you up for that? (Audience) Yes! And two, just be prepared to have a go. So grab a pen and a piece of paper. OK, so here\'s how it\'s going to work: I’ll show you the first cartoon we\'re going to do, so just watch to begin with. Here we go. Just watching. That\'s going to be our first cartoon. It\'s a character called Spike. I\'d like you to draw along with me. I\'ll draw the first line, you draw, and when you\'ve done that, look up, and I\'ll know you\'re ready for the next line. Okay, here we go. Start with the nose. Now the eyes. They\'re like 66s or speech marks. That\'s it. Next, the mouth. Nice, big smile. Now, over here, the ear. Next, some spiky hair. Next, put the pen to the left to the mouth, little line like that. Pen under the ear, drop a line like that. Pen to the left of the neck, top of the T-shirt. Line to the left, line to the right. Just hold your drawings up and show everyone. (Laughter) How are we all doing? (Laughter) OK. OK, fantastic. So, it looks like you\'ve just learned to draw one cartoon, but you\'ve actually learned more than that; you\'ve learned a sequence that would enable you to draw hundreds and thousands of different cartoons, because we\'re just going to do little variations on that sequence. Have a go at this. Draw along with me. Nose. Eyes. Smile. That\'s it. Now some hair. Pen to the left of the mouth, under the hair, little V-shape for the top, line to the left, line to the right. So we\'ve got another character. Let\'s call her Thelma. (Laughter) So, we\'ve got Spike and Thelma. Let\'s try another one. Here we go. Another little variation. You\'re getting the idea. Starting with the nose. But this time we\'ll change the eyes slightly. Look, two circles together like that. That\'s it. Then, two little dots in for the eyes. And this time we\'ll change the mouth slightly. Watch. Little circle colored in there. Have a go at that. Next, the ear. Now, we\'ll have some fun with the hair, watch. Nice curly hair. Then same thing: pen to the left to the mouth, little line like that. Under the ear, drop a line. Top of the T-shirt. Line to the left, line to the right. I think we\'ll call him Jeff. (Laughter) We\'ll do one more. One more go. Here we go. You\'re getting the idea. (Laughter) So we\'ll start with a nose again. Notice we\'re doing little variations. Now we\'ll change the eyes, so we\'ve got them apart. We\'ll put some little dots in like that. Next, the mouth slightly different. Let\'s put a little V-shape like that. Triangle. And a little line across, and we\'ll just color this a little bit in. Now, watch this bit carefully; some hair, watch. Here we go, little line like that. Next, a bit more there. And watch, a couple of triangles to make a little bow. Triangle at the bottom, rest of the hair. Pen to the left of the mouth again. You get the idea. Drop a line for the neck. Now the V-shape. Line to the left, line to the right. There we go. Let\'s call her Pam. (Laughter) So you\'ve done... (Laughter) So you\'ve done four cartoons. You can have a little rest now. (Laughter) Take a rest. You\'re getting the idea. All we\'re doing is little variations. I\'ll just demonstrate a couple to you. We could go on all day, couldn\'t we? You could do someone looking unhappy, a bit like that, or you could experiment with, perhaps, someone who is… just draw a straight line, someone looking a bit fed up. Or perhaps, you could do anything you like, really, just try things out. Look at this. Little squiggle. There we are. So, all sorts of things we could do. Actually, one more I\'ll let you do, one more idea. This is a great little technique. Have a go at this: people with glasses on. Just draw a nose a bit like Spike\'s. Next, draw some frames, so two circles like that with a little bit in between. Now, just put some dots inside for the eyes like that. Next, the ear. So it\'s little bit like we did before, but this time we\'ll join up the frames. That\'s it. Watch this bit. (Laughter) And this bit I really like. Watch. (Laughter) And then, little bit there. Pencil under the mustache, line down, top of the shirt, left and right. So there we have it. We could carry on, couldn\'t we? Hopefully, we\'ve done enough to convince you that in fact we can all draw. And not just people here. I\'ve worked with… I\'m going to give you three examples of other people who\'ve learned to draw, and that actually surprised them, too. I\'m going to save what I think is my favorite, most surprising example until last. The first example is: I\'ve worked a lot with children and students in schools. Actually the little ones, they just draw fine, but when they get to about 15 or 16, most of them think they can\'t draw. But I worked with them. I worked this week in a school where I was coaching them on using pictures for memory. A girl was trying to remember what red blood cells do, and she drew this little picture of a red blood cell carrying a handbag with O2 on it to remind her that the red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body. That was a great one. The other people I worked with are many adults in all walks of life, and particularly in business, and they often will want to make presentations memorable. So again, a quick cartoon or sketch could be really good for that. And again, most people think they can\'t draw, but take this example. Couple of wavy lines, little boat could be a metaphor to represent we\'re all in this together. So that, if that was just drawn in the presentation, would really stay in the memory, wouldn\'t it? Yeah. But the third example is - you shouldn\'t have favorites, should you? This is my favorite. Have you ever been at the party when someone asks you what you do? It gets a little bit skeptical when people ask me that. This lady said to me, well - I said, "I do a little bit of training, and I teach people to draw," and she said, "Would you come along and do some for our group?" She said, "I work with some people" - she was a volunteer - a group of people who have suffered strokes. So I said, "Sure, I could spare some time for that." So I said I would, and I booked the time in. Have you ever done that? You get near of that time and you think, "What have I let myself in for here?" "Will I be able to do it?" I thought, "What could I do with them?" you see. "I know. I\'ll do my cartoon drawing. They\'ll like that." But then, as I got near of the time, I got more apprehensive, because then I was thinking, "I\'ve worked with children, with all sorts of adults; I\'ve never worked with a group like this." It turns out it was all part of a charity called TALK. This TALK charity is a wonderful charity that helps people who\'ve suffered strokes, but have a particular condition known as aphasia. You might have heard of aphasia, sometimes called dysphasia. The key thing is it affects their ability to communicate. So, for example, they might have trouble reading, writing, speaking, or understanding. It can be quite an isolating condition; it can be very, very frustrating and can lead to a loss of confidence. Anyway, so I prepared all this stuff, what to do for this session - for a couple of hours, tea break in the middle - and I got more apprehensive. But actually, I needn\'t have worried, because I\'m going to show you now the work that they did. It was one of the best things I\'ve ever done. I\'m going to show you the first slide. I taught them Spike, just like I did for you, and I want you to see the reaction on their faces when they did this. (Audience) Oh. What you can see here are two of the stroke recoverers on the left and right, and one of the volunteer helpers in the center. Each stroke recoverer, there are about 36 in the room with volunteers as well, there\'s one-to-one helpers. You can just see the delight on their faces, can\'t you? Let\'s look at another picture. This is a gentleman called David, and he\'s holding up his picture, and you can tell it was the picture of Spike, can\'t you? In fact, I think he\'s drawn Spike even better there. But what I didn\'t realize until even after the session was that the number of the people in this session, including David, were drawing with their wrong hand. David\'s stroke meant that it affected the right side of his body, and he drew with his left hand, as many did. Nobody mentioned it to me, nobody complained. They just got on with it. It was an inspirational session for me. It was quite a humbling session, one of the best things I felt I\'ve ever done. At the end of it, I had a lovely email from doctor Mike Jordan, and he\'s the chair of the TALK group; happens to be a medical doctor, but he\'s the chair of the group. He wrote to me, and I\'m quoting, he said, "Our recoverers learned today that they can draw. It\'s a bit more than that; this sort of activity really builds their confidence." So I was happy, he was happy, everyone was happy, they\'ve invited me back again, and I go in there now about every three or four months. So it\'s great. I thought that was a lovely example to share. Fancy one more drawing? (Audience) Yes. Here we go. Grab your pens. Here we go. Right. I\'m going to get you to draw someone that you would recognize. So start with a big nose, a bit like Spike\'s. Next, we\'ll do some eyes, and you might be thinking, "This is also a bit like Spike." Watch the next bit. You\'re getting warm. There you go. Little line down there. Down here. Little V-shape, line to the left, line to the right. And you\'ve got Albert Einstein. (Laughter) So you\'ve got the pens with you, you\'ve proved that you can draw. You\'re very welcome to take the pens with you and have a practice at home, even show somebody else. But actually, I\'d like to leave you with a final thought. When you walked in here today, many of you didn\'t believe you could draw. I\'ve got a question for you about that. How many other beliefs and limiting thoughts do we all carry around with us every day? Beliefs that we could perhaps potentially challenge and think differently about. If we did challenge those beliefs and think differently about them, apart from drawing, what else would be possible for us all? Thank you very much.

For example, the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound, which gives me that -- (Trumpet) -- flavor. (Laughter) And the other ones here, I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that. I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here. (Noises) TEDx. (Music) (Applause) I got way too much time on my hands.

So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.', '01:31': "But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life. I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.", '02:05': "If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you a real human brain.", '02:16': '(Groaning, laughter)', '02:24': "So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another.", '02:45': "For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor. The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres are completely separate. Because they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different things, they care about different things, and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.", '03:28': 'Assistant: It has been.', '03:30': '(Laughter)', '03:33': 'Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment. It\'s all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.', '04:44': 'My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it\'s all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we\'ve ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language. It\'s that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It\'s that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you\'ve got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It\'s that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important, it\'s that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am."', '05:55': 'And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.', '06:12': 'On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I\'ll just start my normal routine."', '06:39': 'So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body, full-exercise machine. And I\'m jamming away on this thing, and I\'m realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That\'s very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought, "Whoa, I\'m a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I\'m the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I\'m witnessing myself having this experience.', '07:16': 'And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I\'m walking across my living room floor, and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid and very deliberate. There\'s no fluidity to my pace, and there\'s this constriction in my area of perception, so I\'m just focused on internal systems. And I\'m standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK. You muscles, you\'ve got to contract. You muscles, you relax."', '07:52': "And then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end, because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy -- energy.", '08:18': 'And I\'m asking myself, "What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me. And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there.', '08:58': 'Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, "Hey! We\'ve got a problem! We\'ve got to get some help." And I\'m going, "Ahh! I\'ve got a problem!"', '09:07': '(Laughter)', '09:08': 'So it\'s like, "OK, I\'ve got a problem." But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.', '09:28': 'So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful.', '10:03': 'And again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says, "Hey! You\'ve got to pay attention. We\'ve got to get help." And I\'m thinking, "I\'ve got to get help. I\'ve got to focus." So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I\'m walking around my apartment, and I\'m thinking, "I\'ve got to get to work. Can I drive?"', '10:20': 'And in that moment, my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh! I\'m having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool!', '10:33': '(Laughter)', '10:35': 'This is so cool! How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out?"', '10:42': '(Laughter)', '10:44': 'And then it crosses my mind, "But I\'m a very busy woman!"', '10:48': '(Laughter)', '10:49': '"I don\'t have time for a stroke!" So I\'m like, "OK, I can\'t stop the stroke from happening, so I\'ll do this for a week or two, and then I\'ll get back to my routine. OK. So I\'ve got to call help. I\'ve got to call work." I couldn\'t remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I\'m looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind\'s eye what my business card looked like, I couldn\'t tell if this was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn\'t tell. And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that\'s not the card... that\'s not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone, but it\'s the only plan I have.', '11:56': 'So I take the phone pad and I put it right here. I take the business card, I put it right here, and I\'m matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out into La La Land, and not remember when I came back if I\'d already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back to normal reality, I\'d be able to tell, "Yes, I\'ve already dialed that number."', '12:29': 'Eventually, the whole number gets dialed and I\'m listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)', '12:39': '(Laughter)', '12:42': 'And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"', '12:47': '(Laughter)', '12:49': 'And so I say to him -- clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo." I\'m thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn\'t know -- I didn\'t know that I couldn\'t speak or understand language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.', '13:10': 'And a little while later, I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender.', '13:35': 'And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition.', '13:54': "When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body.", '15:13': 'But then I realized, "But I\'m still alive! I\'m still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and I\'m still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover.', '16:09': 'Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years to completely recover.', '16:28': 'So who are we? We are the life-force power of the universe, with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds. And we have the power to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.

I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.", '01:44': '(Laughter)', '01:45': 'It was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They\'re called the CCHR. And I said to him, "Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can\'t be trusted?" And he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you." And I said, "How?" And he said, "We\'re going to introduce you to Tony." And I said, "Who\'s Tony?" And he said, "Tony\'s in Broadmoor." Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It\'s where they send the serial killers, and the people who can\'t help themselves. And I said to Brian, "Well, what did Tony do?" And he said, "Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well, and now he\'s stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he\'s sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?" So I said, "Yes, please."', '02:55': 'So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It\'s all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me, "They\'re medicated," which, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world, but I\'m thinking it\'s probably a good idea.', '03:47': '(Laughter)', '03:50': 'And then Brian said, "Here\'s Tony." And a man was walking in. And he wasn\'t overweight, he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn\'t wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane.', '04:15': 'And he sat down. And I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?" And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17. And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, \'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you\'re mad, you\'ll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas, you\'ll have your own PlayStation.\'" I said, "Well, how did you do it?" He said, "Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I\'d just seen a film called \'Crash,\' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.\'" And I said, "What else?" He said, "Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make me feel more normal." I said, "Where\'d you get that from?" He said, "Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."', '05:10': 'Anyway, he faked madness too well, he said. And they didn\'t send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist, said, "There\'s been a terrible misunderstanding. I\'m not mentally ill." I said, "How long have you been here for?" He said, "Well, if I\'d just done my time in prison for the original crime, I\'d have got five years. I\'ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years."', '05:40': 'Tony said that it\'s a lot harder to convince people you\'re sane than it is to convince them you\'re crazy. He said, "I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what\'s on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, \'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?\' When I read my medical notes, I saw they\'d written: \'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"', '06:14': '(Laughter)', '06:16': 'He said, "You know, they\'re always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It\'s just impossible." When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"', '06:36': 'He said, "You know, I\'ve got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and I\'ve got the \'Tiptoe Through the Tulips\' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I\'m aloof and grandiose." So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know?', '07:03': 'And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, "What\'s the story?" And he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations -- that had seemed quite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him, and we\'ve determined that what he is is a psychopath." And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It\'s on the checklist: cunning, manipulative. So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstripe suit -- classic psychopath -- speaks to items one and two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, "Well, but why didn\'t he hang out with the other patients?" Classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath.', '08:10': 'And his clinician said to me, "If you want to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by Robert Hare, who invented the psychopath checklist." So I did. I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept -- psychopath spotter.', '08:32': "So, here's the statistics: One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's 1,500 people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders, so I think there's a very good chance there's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night.", '09:05': '(Laughter)', '09:09': 'Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It\'s like a form of psychopathy that\'s come down to affect us all. Hare said, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? That\'s not a big story. The big story," he said, "is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."', '09:50': 'So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said, "Could I come and interview you in prison, to find out it you\'re psychopaths?"', '09:58': '(Laughter)', '09:59': "And they didn't reply.", '10:00': '(Laughter)', '10:02': 'So I changed tack. I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, "I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special, and interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?" And he said, "Come on over!"', '10:34': '(Laughter)', '10:36': 'So I went to Al Dunlap\'s grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers -- he was taking me through the garden -- there were falcons and eagles, he was saying, "Over there you\'ve got sharks and --" he was saying this in a less effeminate way -- "You\'ve got more sharks and you\'ve got tigers." It was like Narnia.', '11:02': '(Laughter)', '11:06': 'And then we went into his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies, he\'d close down 30 percent of the workforce. And he\'d quite often fire people with a joke. Like, for instance, one famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said, "I\'ve just bought myself a new car." And he said, "Well, you may have a new car, but I\'ll tell you what you don\'t have -- a job."', '11:31': 'So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, "You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?" He said, "Yeah, it\'s an amazing theory, it\'s like Star Trek. You\'re going where no man has gone before." And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)', '11:49': '(Laughter)', '11:51': 'Some psychologists might say that this makes you --" (Mumbles)', '11:56': '(Laughter)', '11:58': 'And he said, "What?" And I said, "A psychopath." And I said, "I\'ve got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"', '12:09': 'And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, "Okay, go on." And I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth." Which I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny, because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself.', '12:22': '(Laughter)', '12:26': 'He said, "Well, you\'ve got to believe in you!" And I said, "Manipulative." He said, "That\'s leadership."', '12:34': '(Laughter)', '12:35': 'And I said, "Shallow affect, an inability to experience a range of emotions." He said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?" So he was going down the psychopath checklist, basically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"', '12:49': '(Laughter)', '12:52': 'But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal -- like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency, he said he got accepted into West Point, and they don\'t let delinquents in West Point. He said "no" to many short-term marital relationships. He\'s only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument, and his second marriage has lasted 41 years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well I\'m not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked "Psychopath." I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges.', '13:50': "And I realized, my God -- this is what I've been doing for 20 years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks, and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar -- children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high on the bipolar checklist.", '14:33': 'When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, "Why haven\'t you been returning my calls?" I said, "Well, they say that you\'re a psychopath." And he said, "I\'m not a psychopath." He said, "You know what? One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime, they say, \'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn\'t.\' It\'s like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down." He said, "I\'ve got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it?" So I said okay.', '15:10': 'So I went to his tribunal. And after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go. They decided that he shouldn\'t be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, "You know what, Jon? Everyone\'s a bit psychopathic." He said, "You are, I am. Well, obviously I am." I said, "What are you going to do now?" He said, "I\'m going to go to Belgium. There\'s a woman there that I fancy. But she\'s married, so I\'m going to have to get her split up from her husband."', '15:51': '(Laughter)', '15:56': 'Anyway, that was two years ago, and that\'s where my book ended. And for the last 20 months, everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was, according to Brian the Scientologist, making up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous, but isn\'t necessarily ominous. Unfortunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a "fracas" in a bar, he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad, but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was, it wasn\'t too bad.', '16:35': 'And then he phoned me. And you know what, I think it\'s right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn\'t define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is, is he\'s a semi-psychopath. He\'s a gray area in a world that doesn\'t like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It\'s where you find the humanity, and it\'s where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, "Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you\'ve done for me." And I didn\'t go.

Hello, San Francisco! TEDx – oh my God, blinding light! Hi, everybody! How are you? (Audience cheering) Fine?! Oh my gosh! Okay, so... My name is Mel Robbins, and for the last seventeen years, I have done nothing but help people get everything that they want. Within reason! My husband\'s here. So, I\'ve done it in the courtroom, in the boardroom, in the bedroom, in people\'s living room, whatever room you want to be in, if I\'m there, I will help you get whatever you want by any means necessary. For the last three years – I host a syndicated radio show. Five days a week, I go live in forty cities and I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck. Do you know that a third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives right now? That is a hundred million people! That\'s insane! And I\'ve come face to face with it in this new show that I\'m doing, which is also insane, it\'s called "In-laws". I move in with families across America – (Laughter) You guessed it! – who are at war with their in-laws. We move them into the same house, I verbally assassinate everybody, we open up Pandora\'s box, and I get people to stop arguing about the donuts and who is hosting Thanksgiving dinner,  and talk about the real stuff. And that\'s what I want to talk to you about. I\'m here for you. I\'m going to tell you everything I know in less than eighteen minutes about how to get what you want. So I want you to take a millisecond right now and think about what you want. You! And I want you to be selfish. Screw Simon and the "We" thing. This is about me, right now! (Laughter) (Applause) Sorry, Simon. What do you want? And here\'s the deal. I don\'t want it to sound good to other people. Being healthy will not get your ass on a treadmill. Losing your manboobs, so you can hook up with somebody, now that\'s motivation. (Laughter) So, I want to know: What do you want? Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to triple your income? Do you want to start a nonprofit? Do you want to find love? What is it? Get it, right here. You know what it is, don\'t analyze it to death, just pick something. That\'s part of the problem. You won\'t pick. So, we\'re going to be talking about how you get what you want. And frankly, getting what you want is simple. But notice I didn\'t say it was easy. It\'s very simple. In fact, if you think about it, we live in the most amazing moment in time. So that thing that you have up here, whatever it may be, you want to use healthy eating to cure your diabetes, you want to figure out how to take care of the elders and start a new hospice center, you want to move to Africa and build a school... Guess what? You can walk into a book store – right now! – and buy at least ten books written by credentialed experts on how the hell you do it. You could Google it. And you could probably find at least, I don\'t know - a thousand blogs documenting the step, by step, by step transformation that somebody else is already doing. You can find anybody online and cyber-stalk them! (Laughter) You can just walk in their footsteps – just use the science of drafting. Follow what everyone else has done, because somebody is already doing it! So why don\'t you have what you want, when you have all the information that you need, you have the contacts that you need, there are probably free tools online that allow you to start a business, or join a group, or do whatever the heck you want!? It all comes down to one word: F*©#. Shut the front door, you know what I\'m talking about? The f-bomb. It\'s everywhere! You hear it all the time! I honestly don\'t understand what the appeal is of the word. I mean, you don\'t sound smart when you say it. And it\'s really not expressing how you really feel. It\'s sort of a cheap shot to take. And of course you know I\'m talking about the word "fine". "How you doing?" "Oh, I\'m fine." Oh, really? You are? Dragging around those extra forty pounds, you\'re fine? Feeling like roommates with your spouse, and you\'re fine? You haven\'t had sex in four months, you\'re fine? Really?! I don\'t think so! But see, here\'s the deal with saying that you\'re fine: It\'s actually genius. Because if you\'re fine, you don\'t have to do anything about it. But when you think about this word "fine", it just makes me so angry. Here we are at a conference about being alive and you\'re going to describe the experience of being alive as "fine"?! What a flimsy and feeble word! If you\'re crappy, say you\'re crappy! If you\'re amazing say you\'re amazing! Tell the truth! And this not only goes for the social construct: "Oh, I don\'t want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life", or: "Hey, I\'m amazing! But that would make you feel terrible." The bigger issue – The bigger issue with "fine" is that you say it to yourself. That thing that you want, I guarantee you, you\'ve convinced yourself that you\'re fine not having it. That\'s why you\'re not pushing yourself. It\'s the areas in your life where you\'ve given up. Where you\'ve said, "Oh, I\'m fine. My mom\'s never going to change, so I just can\'t have that conversation." "I\'m fine. We\'ve got to wait until the kids graduate, before we get divorced, so we\'ll just sleep in separate bedrooms." "I\'m fine. I lost my job, I can barely pay my bills, but whatever – It\'s hard to get a job." One of the reasons why this word also just annoys me so much is, scientists have calculated – Oh yeah, I\'m coming down! (Laughter) Scientists have calculated the odds of you being born. That\'s right. They\'ve crunched the numbers. I see you up there. They\'ve crunched the numbers on you – Yeah, you guys standing up, you want to sit down for this. They\'ve crunched the numbers on you being born. And they took into account all of the wars, and the natural disasters, and the dinosaurs, and everything else. And do you realize that the odds, the odds of you, yeah, right here, put your computer away,  stand up for me, Doug! (Laughter) So the odds of Doug here, turn around, say "hi" to everybody – the odds of Doug being born at the moment in time he was born, to the parents you were born to, with the DNA structure that you have, one in four hundred trillion! Isn\'t that amazing? Doug: I\'m so lucky! Mel: Yes! You\'re not fine, you\'re fantastic! You have life-changing ideas for a reason, and it\'s not to torture yourself. Thank you. Thank you, Doug. (Applause) Christine was right when she said all of you could be on stage. Because all of you – we\'re all in this category. One in four hundred trillion. All day long you have ideas that could change your life, that could change the world, that could change the way that you feel, and what do you do with them? Nothing! (Grunts) Hopefully I won\'t moon you. (Laughter) You didn\'t pay for that. (Laughter)  And I want you to just think for a minute, because we all have – I love to use the analogy "the inner snooze button" – you have these amazing ideas that bubble up. You\'ve been watching people all day and I guarantee you, like ping pong balls – bam-bam-bam and everytime you have an idea, what do you do? – Hit the snooze! What\'s the first decision you made this morning? I bet it was to go back to bed. "Yeah, first decision today, I\'m one in four hundred trillion, I\'m going to go back to sleep." And I get it! Your bed is comfortable! It\'s cosy, it\'s warm! If you\'re lucky, you\'ve got somebody that you love next to you, or in my case, I\'ve got my husband and my two kids and possibly the dog. And the reason why I\'m bringing up this first decision that you made today, and the inner snooze alarm, is because in any area of your life that you want to change, any – there\'s one fact that you need to know. This one: You are never going to feel like it. Ever. No one\'s coming, motivation isn\'t happening,  you\'re never going to feel like it. Scientists call it activation energy. That\'s what they call the force required to get you to change from what you\'re doing on autopilot to do something new. So try this test tomorrow. You think you\'re so fancy, I know, you\'re attending TED. (Laughter) Try this. Tomorrow morning, set your alarm for thirty minutes earlier. And then when it goes off, take those sheets, throw them off, and stand up and start your day. No snooze, no delay, no, "I\'ll just wait here for five seconds because Mel\'s not standing here" – Do it. And the reason why I want you to do it is because you will come face to face with the physical, and I mean physical force that\'s required to change your behavior. Do you think that somebody who needs to lose weight ever feels like going on a diet? Of course not! You think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas instead of a croissant? I don\'t think so! The activation energy required to get your ass away from your computer and out the front door, to go on the walk, you said that you were going to go on, is the exact same amount of force that it takes you to push yourself out of a warm bed and into a cold room. What\'s interesting about being an adult is that when you become eighteen, nobody tells you that it\'s now going to be your job to parent yourself. And by "parent yourself", I mean it\'s your job to make yourself do the crap you don\'t want to do, so you can be everything that you\'re supposed to be. And you\'re so damn busy waiting to feel like it. And you\'re never going to! My son never feels like getting off his DS. That\'s my job! Get off the damn DS! Kendall, clean up the Barbies! If you\'re going to have a nude party in my bathroom, at least clean it up! (Laughter) God, chew with your mouth closed! We\'re not a barn, for crying out loud! Alright, dinner is coming, get out of the pantry. As parents, and you were a kid, your parents make you do the things you don\'t feel like doing. Because you won\'t. Ever. Not now, not then, not ever! And even when you get good at something, you\'ll figure out something else you don\'t want to do. And then you\'ll plateau out, get bored, "I hate this job. Blah blah boring." But will you look for a new one? No! You\'ll just bitch about that one. It\'s very, very simple to get what you want. But it\'s not easy. You have to force yourself. And I mean force. And the reason why I use the word "force" – when Roz was up here and talking about the emotion tracking,  and she had the picture of two sides of the brain – I look at the brain the exact same way. Only I describe one side of your brain as autopilot and the other side as emergency brake. That\'s the only two speeds you get: autopilot, emergency brake. And guess which one your brain likes better: autopilot. You\'ve had the experience where you\'ve driven to work and you get there and you\'re like, "Oh my God, I don\'t remember ever driving here." (Laughter) You weren\'t drunk! That was your brain on autopilot. It was functioning just at this level. And the problem with your mind is that anytime you do anything that\'s different from your normal routine, guess what your brain does — emergency brake! And it has that reaction for everything. Everything! You walk into the kitchen and see everybody\'s left their breakfast dishes for you. And you think for the hundredth time, "I\'m going to kill them. In fact I\'m gonna leave it here and I\'m going to make them do it." But that\'s not your normal routine, is it? So your mind goes: emergency brake! And you go right into autopilot. "I\'ll just load it, and be pissed, and then not have sex. That\'s what I\'m going to do." (Laughter) (Applause) So, when I say "force", anything that\'s a break from your routine is going to require force. And if you think about your life, it\'s kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adults, and we spend so much time trying to push our life into some sort of stable routine, and then we grow bored of it! You wake up at the same time every day, you have largely the same breakfast, you drive to work the same way, show up at work, look busy, avoid making calls, update Facebook, you attend a meeting and doodle the whole time, go back and update Facebook, make plans for the evening, you look busy some more, then drive home the same way, you eat largely the same dinner or a variety of it, you watch the same kind of media, and then you go to bed, and do the same thing all over again! No wonder you\'re bored out of your mind! It\'s the routine that\'s killing you. I have this theory about why people get stuck in life. So, most of you\'ve probably taken your Basic Psych 101 class, and you\'ve bumped into Abraham Maslow\'s "Hierarchy of Needs"? Well, your body is kinda cool. Because you have these basic needs. And your body is wired to send you signals. If you need food, what do you feel? If you need water, what do you feel? If you need sex, what do you feel? (Laughter) Thank you. I think when you feel stuck or dissatisfied in your life, it\'s a signal. And it\'s not a signal that your life is broken. It\'s a signal that one of your most basic needs are not being met. Your need for exploration. Everything about your life, about your body, grows! Your cells regenerate, your hair, your nails, everything grows for your entire life. And your soul needs exploration and growth. And the only way you\'ll get it is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable. Forcing yourself to get outside,  out of your head. Thank you. If you\'re in your head, you\'re behind enemy lines. That is not God talking, okay? It\'s not! In fact, if I put a speaker on it and we broadcast what you say to yourself, we would institutionalize you. (Laughter) You would not hang out with people that talk to you the way you talk to yourself. So get out of your head! Your feelings! Your feelings are screwing you! I don\'t care how you feel! I care about what you want! And if you listen to how you feel, when it comes to what you want – you will not get it. Because you will never feel like it. And you need to get outside your comfort zone. It\'s not about taking risks, it\'s about getting outside your comfort zone. Those first three seconds when you push yourself out of bed, they blow. But once you\'re up, it\'s great. Those first three seconds when you\'re sitting here in a stadium like this and somebody says, "Get up and come dance," and you think, "Oh, I should do that," and then you\'re like, "Uhmm." That experience that you had when you had the impulse to do it and then you didn\'t do the activation energy required to force yourself, your emergency brake got pulled – "I\'m sitting right here. I\'m not going up with those crazy people, I don\'t like to dance..." What happened for me is I came up, and I bumped into Rachel, and then we started talking, and next thing you know, she\'s tweeting. And we\'re friends. And – boom! Get outside. That\'s where the magic is. That\'s where the one in four hundred trillion exists. So everything I do – oh, OK, this is the last part. Sorry. So one more thing that you can use, I call it the five-second-rule. Your mind can process a facial expression in 33 milliseconds. It can move pretty damn quick. The other thing that it does very quickly is if you have one of those little impulses that are pulling you, if you don\'t marry it with an action within five seconds, you pull the emergency brake and kill the idea. Kill it! If you have the impulse to get up and come dance while the band is playing, if you don\'t stand up in five seconds, you\'re going to pull the emergency brake. If you have an impulse about, you were inspired by somebody\'s speech today, and you don\'t do something within five seconds – write a note, send yourself a text – anything physical to marry it with the idea, you will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea. Your problem isn\'t ideas. Your problem is you don\'t act on them. You kill them. It\'s not my fault. It\'s not anybody\'s fault. You\'re doing it to yourself. Stop it! I\'m counting on you. One in four hundred trillion. You got stuff to do! And it\'s not going to happen in your head. So I want you to practice this today. When we go off to party, thank God it\'s coming soon,  because I think we all could use a cocktail, I want you to practice the five-second-rule. You see somebody and you think you have an impulse,  they look interesting? Walk over there! You were inspired by somebody and you have a request? Make it! That\'s why you\'re here! Experiment with it, and I think you\'ll be shocked about what happens. And one more thing, I want you to know that everything that I do, whether it\'s the radio show, or the television show,  or the book that I wrote, or the column, it\'s for you. And if there is anything that I can do, if I can do anything to make you do the things you don\'t want to do, so you can have what you want, I will do it. But you need to walk over, you need to open your mouth, and you need to make the request. You got it? Good. Go do it. (Applause) Thank you! Thank you, yes! Stand up! You have the impulse, stand up!

We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers because they're unknown. I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy, for example: What would it feel like to be a dog? Do fish feel pain? How about insects? Was the Big Bang just an accident? And is there a God? And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She? Why do so many innocent people and animals suffer terrible things? Is there really a plan for my life? Is the future yet to be written, or is it already written and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will? I mean, who am I anyway? Am I just a biological machine? But then, why am I conscious? What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day? I mean, I kind of assumed that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions. Someone must know, right? Guess what? No one knows. Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever. But diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there. So, two questions that no one on Earth knows the answer to. (Music) [How many universes are there?] Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight, I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is. And then I remember that there's an object we see every day that would literally fit one million Earths inside it: the Sun. It seems impossibly big. But in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick, one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which you can see on a clear night as a pale white mist stretched across the sky. And it gets worse. There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes. So if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30-foot by 30-foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos, that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond. But nonetheless, combined, they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. The leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made up of 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeros, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe, and all of the atoms in all those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total, namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. (Laughter) But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? Quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling, and some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams, and in another, not so much. Well, there are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one. Only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing. This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen. (Music) [Why can't we see evidence of alien life?] Somewhere out there in that vast universe there must surely be countless other planets teeming with life. But why don't we see any evidence of it? Well, this is the famous question asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: Where is everybody? Conspiracy theorists claim that UFOs are visiting all the time and the reports are just being covered up, but honestly, they aren't very convincing. But that leaves a real riddle. In the past year, the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets just around nearby stars. And if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle: our Earth didn't form until about nine billion years after the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy should have formed earlier, and given life a chance to get underway billions, or certainly many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years, an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant energy-harvesting artifacts or fleets of colonizing spaceships or glorious works of art that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single, superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid of any potential competitors. It's just sitting there ready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat. Or maybe they're not that intelligent, or perhaps the evolution of an intelligence capable of creating sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed. After all, it's only happened once on Earth in four billion years. Maybe even that was incredibly lucky. Maybe we are the first such civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control the technologies it creates. But there are numerous more hopeful answers. For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful amount of money on it. Only a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely for signs of interesting signals. And perhaps we're not looking the right way. Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful than electromagnetic waves. Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious recently discovered dark matter, or dark energy, that appear to account for most of the universe's mass. Or, maybe we're looking at the wrong scale. Perhaps intelligent civilizations come to realize that life is ultimately just complex patterns of information interacting with each other in a beautiful way, and that that can happen more efficiently at a small scale. So, just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems have shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods, maybe intelligent life itself, in order to reduce its footprint on the environment, has turned itself microscopic. So the Solar System might be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them. Maybe the very ideas in our heads are a form of alien life. Well, okay, that's a crazy thought. The aliens made me say it. But it is cool that ideas do seem to have a life all of their own and that they outlive their creators. Maybe biological life is just a passing phase. Well, within the next 15 years, we could start seeing real spectroscopic information from promising nearby planets that will reveal just how life-friendly they might be. And meanwhile, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists, maybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd to join the search. And here on Earth, amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different from the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or whether, indeed, it's just us. Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream and ask these questions might yet turn out to be one of the most important facts about the universe. And I have one more piece of good news for you. The quest for knowledge and understanding never gets dull. It doesn't. It's actually the opposite. The more you know, the more amazing the world seems. And it's the crazy possibilities, the unanswered questions, that pull us forward.
