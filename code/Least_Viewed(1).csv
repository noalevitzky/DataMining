https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_seibold_what_is_phantom_traffic_and_why_is_it_ruining_your_life,What is phantom traffic and why is it ruining your life?,"You're cruising down the highway when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear ahead. There's no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit, or narrowing of the road. So why is there so much traffic? It's due to a phenomenon called a phantom traffic jam. Benjamin Seibold explains why it happens and how we might prevent it in the future. [Directed by Cris Wiegandt, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by André Aires, AIM Creative Studios].",4:32,,2020-05-28T15:35:37+00:00,"['TED-Ed', 'travel', 'education', 'transportation', 'animation', 'physics', 'psychology', 'cars']","['English', 'Türkçe']",Benjamin Seibold,Educator,"{'00:12': 'You’re cruising down the highway when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear ahead. There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit or narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there so much traffic?', '00:27': 'When traffic comes to a near standstill for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam is an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own, greater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, we can actually model these jams, even understand the principles that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic in the future.', '00:52': 'For a phantom traffic jam to form, there must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains the same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance to set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights that propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves can travel along a highway for miles.', '01:34': 'With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes or slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars on the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced less than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, sand dunes, cloud patterns, and more.', '02:16': 'The instability is a positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces the number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer for a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, increasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up to stop-and-go traffic.', '02:41': 'Drivers tend not to realize they need to break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having to brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic.', '03:11': 'In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good sense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles or roadway sensors might be able to counteract phantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle would be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually than a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen and prevent traffic waves.', '04:06': 'Traffic jams are not only a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, and our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road conditions ahead— and drive accordingly.'}",

And the way we make movies hasn\'t changed much from a dimensional perspective. Placing a camera and press the rec button, this has not changed at all. Cinema is still a frontal experience, and it\'s still perceived as such. The experience of watching movies is the same since their creation. You stand in front of a screen and look at the image displayed. In fact, there\'s nothing wrong with that. I love going to the movies, watching movies on TV; the experience of watching stories in motion can be so powerful to even move us emotionally. The question we ponder on is how stories in motion can go beyond the flat screen. If we look at the media of the future there is an opportunity to create content that adapts to new platforms. When we shoot a film, we traditionally imagine a scene inside a frame, creating depth with foreground, middleground and background, as the camera moves. Obviously, with new devices like virtual reality or augmented reality goggles or new smart platforms that allow us to navigate in 3D, there is an opportunity to create much more immersive content. In a way that we could move inside it and try to live the experience from a new perspective. I\'m not talking about video games or computer-created characters, even if they look super realistic. I\'m talking about real actors. Flesh-and-blood performance. Artistic performance. To do such a thing we would have to start redefining or thinking about new technologies and methodologies to enable these new experiences. We already know about 360-degree filming, putting a camera in the center that allows us to create a 360-degree immersive image. This already takes us one step further in an interaction. But it\'s still a frontal experience. To start investigating how we could get into the scene we would have to capture the light from all angles, putting cameras and sensors to capture all the light from all perspectives. These solutions allow us to recreate the subject in three dimensions. It would be like a 3D photograph. This allows us to not just record the image on one single plane but capture it as a volume. This is what we call volumetric video. It is the process of capturing light and storing it inside a voxel. But what is a voxel? A voxel is like a pixel in three dimensions. Instead of being a flat square with light information, it\'s like a cube in space, with position X, Y and Z, saving all the light information from all perspectives. This methodology allows us to generate a volume of light visible from all sides. And with this, we can start thinking and opening up the opportunities for new content. Obviously, to capture and create film and scenes and stories with this kind of solution we would have to create a space large enough to accommodate entire scenes and montages, and powerful enough to install hundreds of cameras and process that huge amount of information. It sounds like a crazy idea, but it\'s exactly what we did. For the last three years we\'ve been building the studio of the future. We installed hundreds of cameras. And we built a gigantic dome that allows us to create exactly what we wanted. We called it Intel Studios. It is the world\'s largest volumetric camera, created to develop, research, and define new methodologies for interactive content. But what does interactive content mean? What does it mean to get into the scene? To test these new hypotheses and ideas we decided, for the first time we used the studio, to choose a classic scene. We picked a scene from the Far West. We brought scenarios, filled the studio with dirt, actors, four horses, to recreate an entire scene but this time captured from all angles. The actors, to work on these new media, faced a challenge. They had to act flawlessly to be seen from all angles. There is no longer a frontal position that you just refer to. But now we have to think of all perspectives. Very similar to theater. Let\'s see now what came out with the first result. What you see here opened our eyes to the opportunities we can have with these new technologies and media. The result was a complete full scan of the entire scene. And it allowed us to move inside in a free way that we couldn\'t before. With this new solution we can see not only the image or light emitted on a screen but also get into that light and navigate inside its volume, perceiving it from new angles. Now let\'s look at one of the shots we rendered using this technology. What you will see is done entirely with a virtual camera that moves in space. (Volumetric video) (End of volumetric video) (Applause) Thank you. As you can see, with this solution we manage to have total control of space and movement, allowing new angles and freedom for content creation. But what else can we do with this freedom? Can we put a virtual camera in the eyes of the actors, from their points of view? What if instead of the actor we chose the horse? Let\'s look at the same scene -- there wasn\'t a new take -- but this time, from the horse. (Volumetric video) (End of volumetric video) (Applause) No horse was harmed and no camera was placed on his head. Actually, this frees up the possibilities of navigating within the scene. This is perfect for filmmakers or content creators as it gives them the tools to create these new visualizations. But what about the audience? We can look into how the audience can get immersed. That\'s why we partnered up with Paramount Pictures. We researched how the experience and interactions within stories in motion would be like in some Hollywood movies. Together with director Randal Kleiser we got together and recreated the 1978 film Grease. Bringing 20 dancers to the stage, we recreated the song ""You\'re the One That I Want"" in a brand new take. What you see here really allowed the directors and us to break down the barriers of 2D thinking. And start thinking in a whole new way and let new tools come up for content and for creating new stories. But why see it in a flat way? Let\'s invite them to the stage. Not really, we\'ll bring them in augmented reality. I\'m going to use this tablet, I\'m mapping the scenario, recording the information in 3D. (Applause) Let\'s see what they say. (AR video) (Clapping) (End of AR video) (Applause) Thanks to the augmented dancers. As you can see, the content can be experienced as a traditional movie or as an immersive experience. It all depends on how and what we\'re seeing it with. We\'re not trying to change the traditional ways of creating content, but to enhance them. We are at a unique moment in the history of cinema, opening up and understanding new ways to create immersive content. The journey has just begun. I invite you all to join us. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

For one, I\'m mad about the infinite diversity of this kind of little beings. 30 million; not of insects but of species. We say that humans invented the wheel. But dung beetles would move balls of dung way before we would even think of standing up straight. ""Humans invented compost."" Ants would make compost long before any ecologist would in their balcony. And just in case you used to think that we have invented air conditioning you are absolutely wrong. Of course, termites did it before. And there are bugs that serve as thermometers. Here you are: the crickets. The more they crick, the higher the ambient temperature. It obviously varies with the species, but it\'s quite accurate. And these are just some facts about four insects. Figure this multiplied by 30 million! Incredible! (Laughter) Besides, insects are delicious. (Laughter) And this is the second thing I wanted to talk to you about. (Applause) When I was 11 years old, I was eating a hamburger at a fast food restaurant when a kid approaches me and says: ""Do you know that hamburgers are made of insects?"" Hold on for a second! Are insects edible? I later found out that the hamburgers thing was a myth but at the time it kept me wondering and I started searching. And in effect, not only insects are edible but they have a lot of advantages to them. Compared specially with agriculture and the livestock industry, they create more food in less space and using less natural resources. A grass-fed cow needs, give or take one hectare to move. Whereas insects don\'t need more place than what they already take. Now, if you feed that cow 8 kg of food, it will generate 1 kg of meat; approximately an 8-to-1 ratio. If I feed the 8 kg of food to insects they will generate 4 kg: a 8-to-4 ratio. Besides, insects in general have more protein per 100 g than cows. For instance, crickets have 22 percent more protein. And if this was not enough, the livestock industry is responsible for the release of 37 percent methane due to human activities that contributes to the greenhouse effect. And, guess what? Insects create in between 10 and 100 time less methane than, say, pork. Great, well, but if insects are so cool why don\'t we have them in the market shelves? Precisely, for the faces I saw in most of you when I ate a cricket. We don\'t have it in mind here, but in the world today, 2 billion people eat insects on daily basis. As Latinamericans we used to as well, until not so long ago -- Our pre-Columbian diet was made of an important variety of insects: ant larvae, worms, crickets, etc. Until the Spaniards came in and put the same face you just put. Probably, when you think about eating an insect, you will imagine yourselves biting a cockroach like this or cutting with your knife a tarantula this big, but you need not to worry. A product that\'s becoming widespread is insect flour. It has all the benefits I mentioned before plus, you don\'t even realize you are eating crickets in a slice of bread. So, how can we get the most of what insects can give to us? In 2017, we went to Chile with a group of friends. We attended the first Latinamerican Summit for Young Leaders in Biotech. There we introduced and idea I think it can work. We suggested creating insects to produce food with added value in urban areas as a way to solve the problem of the lack of space and the cost of resources. We did this thinking that if we youngsters don\'t tear down cultural barriers, nobody will do it. In fact, we are already doing this regarding genders. And also in Latinamerica the production of food is a neural part of our economy and we cannot stay behind amidst these changes. And to do this it\'s not required a huge warehouse or a big investment. For instance, I try to contribute in my own house breeding insects, studying how to cook them and transform them so they can be more edible. And if they look at insects beyond our preconceptions? What if we see them as thermometers, or as great inventors, and also as food? Nature provides with a solution that is profitable, viable and sustainable. And it\'s even delicious! Let\'s grab this chance and try to change the lens we look to insects with. (Applause)'}",

Maybe you even smelled your own body odour. But there's probably a good reason that some of us don't like certain body smells. Throughout history, there had been many examples of diseases being associated with a smell. So for example, typhoid apparently smells like baked brown bread. Well, that's quite a nice smell, isn't it? But it starts to get a little bit worse. TB smells like stale beer, and yellow fever smells like the inside of a butcher shop, like raw meat. And in fact, when you look at the sort of words used to describe diseases, you tend to find these words: rotting, foul, putrid or pungent. So it's no surprise then, that smell and body odour gets a bit of a bad reputation. If I was to say to you: 'You smell', you're going to take that not exactly as a compliment, are you? But you do smell, you've just found that out, you do smell. It's a scientific fact. I'd quite like to turn that on its head. What if we could actually think about smell in a positive way? What if we could put it to good use? What if we could detect the chemicals that are given off by our bodies when we're ill and use that to diagnose people? Now, we'd need to develop good sensors that would allow us to do this. But it turns out that the world's best sensors actually already exist. And they're called 'animals'. Now, animals are built to smell. They live their everyday lives according to their nose. They sense the environments, which tells them really important information about how to stay alive, essentially. Just imagine a mosquito. Imagine you're a mosquito, and you've just flown in from outside and you've entered this room. You're going to be entering a really complex world. You're going to be bombarded with smells from everywhere. We've just found out that we're really smelly beasts. Each one of us is producing 500-600 different volatile chemicals. It's not just one chemical like BO, lots and lots of chemicals. But it's not just you, it's these seats you're sitting on, the carpet, the glue that holds the carpet to the floor, the paint on the walls, the trees outside, everything around you is producing an odour, and it's a really complex world that the mosquito has to fly through, and it has to find you within that really complex world. And each and every one of you will know - C'mon, hands up, who always get bitten by mosquitoes? And hands up, who never get bitten? There's always one or two really annoying people that never get bitten. But the mosquito has a really hard job to find you, and that's all to do with the way you smell. People who don't attract mosquitoes smell repellent, and what we know is - (Laughter) I should clarify: repellent to mosquitoes, not to people. And what we know now is that is actually controlled by our genes. But mosquitoes are able to do that because they have a highly sophisticated sense of smell, and they're able to see through all this sort of odour sludge to find you, that individual, and bite you as a blood meal. But what would happen if one of you was infected with malaria? Well, let's just have a quick look at the malaria life cycle. So it's quite complex, but basically what happens is: a mosquito has to bite somebody to become infected. Once it bites an infected person, the parasites travel through the mouth part into the gut, and then bursts through the gut, creates cysts, and then the parasites replicate, and then they make a journey from the gut all the way to the salivary glands, where they are then injected back into another person when the mosquito bites because it injects saliva as it bites. Then inside the human it goes through a whole other cycle, a whole other part of the life cycle. So it goes through a liver stage, changes shape and then comes out into the bloodstream again, and eventually that person will become infectious. Now, one thing we know about the parasite world is that they are incredibly good at manipulating their hosts to enhance their own transmission, to make sure that they get passed onwards. If this was to happen in the malaria system, it might make sense that it would be something to do with odour that they manipulate because odour is the key, odour's the thing that links us between mosquitoes; that's how they find us. This is what we call the malaria manipulation hypothesis, and it's something that we've been working on over the last few years. So one of the first things that we wanted to do in our study was to find out whether an infection with malaria actually makes you more attractive to mosquitoes or not. So in Kenya with our colleagues, we designed an experiment where we had participants, children in Kenya, sleep inside tents. The odour from the tent was blown into a chamber which contained mosquitoes. And the mosquitoes would behaviourally respond - they would fly towards or fly away from the odours depending on whether they liked them or not. Now, some of the participants were infected with malaria and some of them were uninfected. But importantly, none of the children had any symptoms whatsoever. Now, when we found and saw the results, it was really quite staggering. People who were infected with malaria were significantly more attractive than people who were uninfected. Let me explain this graph. We have a number of mosquitoes attracted to the child, and we have two sets of data: before treatment and after treatment. On the far left hand side, that bar represents somebody - or a group of people who are uninfected. And as we move towards the right hand side these people have become infected, and they're moving towards the stage that they're infectious. So right at the stage when people are infectious is when they are significantly more attractive. In this study then what we did is we obviously gave the children treatment to clear the parasites, and then we tested them again. And what we found was that highly attractive trait that was there disappeared after they had cleared the infection, so it wasn't just that the people were more attractive, it was that the parasite was manipulating its host in some way to make it more attractive to mosquitoes, standing out like a beacon to attract more mosquitoes so that it could continue its life cycle. The next thing we wanted to do was find out what it was the mosquito was actually smelling. What was it detecting? So to do that we had to collect the body odour from the participants. And we did this by wrapping bags around their feet, which allowed us to collect the volatile odours from their feet. And feet's really important to mosquitoes. They really love the smell of feet. (Laughter) Especially cheesy feet. Anybody got cheesy feet out there? Mosquitoes love that smell. So we focused on the feet and we collected the body odour. Now, when it comes to mosquitoes and olfaction, their sense of smell, it's very complex. It would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected, but it's not that simple. They have to detect a number of chemicals in the right concentration, the right ratios, the right combinations of chemicals. So you can sort of think about it like a musical composition. So, you know, if you get the note wrong or you play it too loud or too soft, it doesn't sound right. Or a recipe, if you get an ingredient wrong, or you cook it too long or too little, it doesn't taste right. Well, smell is the same, it's made up of a suite of chemicals in the right combination. Now, our machines in the lab are not particularly good at picking out this sort of signal; it's quite complex. But animals can. And what we do in my laboratory is we connect microelectrodes to the antenna of a mosquito - imagine how fiddly that is. (Laughter) But what we also do is connect them to individual cells within the antenna, which is incredible. You definitely don't want to sneeze when you're doing this experiment, that's for sure. But what this does is it allows us to measure the electrical response of the smell receptors in the antennae, and so that we can see what a mosquito is smelling. I'm going to show you what this looks like: here's an insect's cell, and it's responding; it will respond in a second when I press this button. You'll see it sort of ticking over with this response. An odour will be blown over the cell, and it will sort of go a bit crazy, sort of blow a raspberry. Then it will go back to its resting potential when we stop the odour. (Clicking) Okay, there we go. So you can go home now and say that you've now seen an insect smelling and even hearing an insect smelling. It's a weird concept, isn't it? But this works really well, and this allows us to see what the insect is detecting. Now, using this method with our malaria samples, we were able to find out what the mosquito was detecting. And we found the malaria associated compounds were a group of compounds, mainly aldehydes, a group of compounds that smelled, that signified the malaria at signal here. So now we know what the smell of malaria is, and we've used the mosquito as a bio-sensor to tell us what the smell of malaria actually is. Now, I'd like to imagine that you could, I don't know, put a harness on a little mosquito and, you know, put it on a lead and take it out and see if we can sniff people in a community - that goes on in my head - and see whether we could actually find people with malaria. But, of course, that's not really possible. But there is an animal that we can do that with. Awww. (Laughter) Yes. Now, dogs have an incredible sense of smell, but there's something a little bit more special about them, they have an ability to learn. And most of you will be familiar with this concept at airports, where dogs will go down a line and sniff out your luggage or yourself for drugs and explosives or even food as well. So we wanted to know: Could we actually train dogs to learn the smell of malaria? And so we've been working with a charity called Medical Detection Dogs to see whether we can train them to learn the smell of malaria. And we went out to the Gambia and did some more odour collection on children that were infected and uninfected. But this time we collected their odour by making them wear socks, nylon stockings to collect their body odour, and we brought them back to the UK, and then we handed them to this charity to run the experiment. Now, I could show you a graph and tell you about how that experiment works, but it'd be a bit dull, wouldn't it? Now, they do say never work with children or animals live. But we're going to break that rule today. So, please welcome onto the stage, Freya (Applause) and her trainer, (Applause) Mark, and Sarah. Of course this is the real star of the show. Okay so, now what I'm going to ask is if you can all just be a little bit quiet, don't move around too much. This is a very strange environment for Freya. She's having a good look at you guys now. So let's stay as calm as possible; that would be great. So what we're going to do here is we're going to ask Freya to move down this line of contraptions here. And in each one of these contraptions we have a pot. In the pot is a sock that's been worn by a child in The Gambia. Now, three of the socks had been worn by children who were uninfected, and just one of the socks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria. So just as you'd see an airport, imagine these were people, and the dog is going to go down and have a good sniff. And let's see if you can see when she senses the malaria. And if she senses it in there. This is a really tough test for her in this very strange environment. So I'm going to hand over now to Mark. (Laughter) Number three. Okay, there we go. (Applause) I didn't know which pot that was in. Mark didn't know which pot that was in. This was a blind test, genuinely. Sarah, was that correct? That was correct. Well done, Freya! That is fantastic. (Applause) Whew! That is really wonderful. Okay, that's brilliant. Now what we're going to do is Sarah's going to change the pots around a little bit; she's going to take the one with malaria away. And we're just going to have four pots that are containing socks from children that had no malaria. So in theory, Freya should go down the line and not stop at all. This is really important because we also need to know people who are not infected; she needs to be able to do that correctly as well. This is a really tough test. These socks have been in the freezer for a couple of years now. And this is a tiny bit of a sock as well, so imagine if this was a whole person and they were giving off a big signal. So this is really quite incredible. Okay, over to you, Mark. Brilliant! Fantastic! (Applause) Really super! Thank you so much, guys. Big round of applause for Freya, Mark and Sarah! Well done, guys. (Applause) What a good girl. She's going to get a treat later. Fantastic. So, you've just seen that for your own eyes. That was a real live demonstration. I was quite nervous about it. I'm so glad that it worked. (Laughter) But it is really incredible, and when we do this, what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody's infected with malaria 81% of the time. It's incredible! 92% of the time, they can tell us correctly when somebody does not have an infection. And those numbers are actually above the criteria set by the World Health Organization for a diagnostic. So we really are looking at deploying dogs in countries, and particularly at ports of entry, to detect people who have malaria. This could be a reality. But we can't deploy dogs everywhere. So what we're also looking to do and working on at the moment is the development of technology, wearable tech that would empower the individual to allow them to self-diagnose. Imagine a patch that you wear on the skin that would detect in your sweat when you're infected with malaria and change colour. Or something a little bit more technical perhaps, a smartwatch that would alert you when you're infected with malaria. And if we can do this digitally, and we can collect data, imagine the amount of data that we can collect on a global scale. This could completely revolutionise the way that we track the spread of diseases, the way that we target our control efforts and respond to disease outbreaks, ultimately helping to lead to the eradication of malaria, and even beyond malaria for other diseases that we already know have a smell. If we can harness the power of nature to find out what those smells are, we could do this and make this a reality. Now, as scientists, we're tasked with coming up with new ideas, new concepts, new technologies, to tackle some of the world's greatest problems. But what never ceases to amaze me is that often, nature has already done this for us. And the answer is right under our nose. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)""}",

This universe is overcrowded with life forms. It is invisible and intangible like the finest layer of reality, which we cannot notice. But it is there, and it maintains the functionality of our everyday world. Without it, we just wouldn\'t exist. Now, would you be surprised if I told you that actually everything I said before is true? Because I\'m about to tell you this. I\'m talking about the world of microbes - a separate world, yet so deeply connected to us. And the story of this connection expands far away into the past. But thanks to modern science, we are now able to read this story like a history book. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present biomolecular archeology, the science behind this history book. And I am here to share with you what fascinating things we can try to manage with this powerful modern science. But let\'s start with the term itself: biomolecular archeology. It\'s not even easy to pronounce, not to mention to try to understand the essence of this phrase. There might not be a problem with the archeology part, right? We\'ve all seen it in movies, we know what it is about, but what is ""biomolecular"" anyway? The first thing that comes to mind: it is something about biology and molecules. And this is actually correct. A biological molecule, or a biomolecule, is any molecule that is present in a living organism. Now, there are all sorts of molecules in your body, but undoubtedly, the most informative one is DNA. So, let\'s bring it back together. Biomolecular archeology enables us to study the DNA recovered from archeological samples. And not only native human DNA, which, of course, all by itself gives lots of study perspectives, but also the DNA of microbes that lived side by side with that human. This science is relatively young. About ten years ago, a massive breakthrough happened in genomic research technology. A method appeared which is called NGS, next generation sequencing, and this method significantly cuts time and costs of any genomic research. For example, have you ever heard about the Human Genome Project? It was quite a popular topic for science fiction some time ago. This project launched in 1990 with the goal to decrypt all genomic information in a human organism. At that time, with the technology of the time, it took ten years and three billion dollars to reach the goals of this project. With NGS, all of that can be done in just one day at the cost of 15,000 dollars. On the fertile soil of next generation sequencing arose biomolecular archeology because there is a great lot of genomic information to be analyzed and it just wouldn\'t be possible to manage such research with olden day technology. Now we are able to manage such research OK, ""But why?"" you could ask me. ""What benefits can we get out of this information? What can we use it for?"" The answer appears to be quite wide. Consider human health as a complex and dynamic system. Apart from genetically determined factors that are stored in our DNA, our health is severely influenced by many other factors, like our lifestyle, our diet, and our fellow microbes. One hundred trillion cells, one and 14 zeros, that\'s the approximate number of microorganisms in your body, ten times greater than the number of your own cells. Your microbial baggage occupies almost 2% of your body weight, that\'s about one and a half kilograms, approximately the weight of your liver. Or your brain. And all these are microbes. Just think about it for a second! Human microbiome, that\'s the modern term for all microbial communities inhabiting your body, has earned a close attention over the last decade. It seems that we are only beginning to discover the mysterious role that is given to microbes in the performance of our health. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. launched the Human Microbiome Project to finally study its relation to our health conditions. And since then, it has only become clearer that our notion about our fellow microbes is inexcusably poor. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, even compared the researchers involved in the project with the 15th century explorers discovering the outline of a new continent. It is now being suggested that a range of modern, widespread diseases, starting from obesity, Crohn\'s disease, other gastrointestinal problems to all sorts of allergies, autoimmune diseases, or maybe even cancer, may appear to be consequences of microbiome changes. But where do these changes come from? When did they first appear? What was the triggering factor? These are the questions we are trying to find answers to at the moment. This topic always triggers a memory of my first conscious experience with the microbial world around. My mother, like any attentive parent, tried her best to warn me against the invisible dangers of the world, and she told me a story that every time I do not wash hands before eating something, I become a reason of global microbial migration. (Laughter) An uncountable number of microbial families come together, pack their suitcases, their TVs, their favorite toys, and leave their houses forever to move to a new area which is thought to be my body. Now, I was a child with a very vivid imagination, and this story influenced me so much that I was obsessed with handwashing for a really long time. It actually took me years to overcome the thought that I\'m doing something wrong when I initiate this microbial migration, and to understand finally that they are actually willing to come, they\'ve got friends there waiting for them. I\'m not trying to convince you not to ever wash your hands again, of course not. But let\'s try to be moderate with it. We lack this microbial diversity nowadays. And as we know from ecology, the most diverse systems are the most stable ones. This might be one of the reasons for our so-called diseases of civilization. And this is exactly the type of hypothesis for biomolecular archeology to deal with. It turns out that there is a unique archaeological material that so preciously stores the enormous amount of information related to ancient human microbiome, and this material is ancient dental plaque, thanks to the fact that oral cavity hygiene was not on the list of top priorities for humans of the past. Their oral microbiome has already been partly fossilized during their lifetime in the form of dental calculus, which, in turn, stays in soil as well preserved as the skeletons themselves. Sadly, we can\'t help these fellas anymore. But they can help us by providing unique and precious information about their microbes and their health, and maybe we will have a chance to help others in the future thanks to them. There is one more vast human health-related aspect where biomolecular archaeology takes its rightful place, and this field of research expands into the valley of ancient deadly pathogens. It is true that the vast majority of microbes either provide us some kind of benefit or do not really care whether there is a human around. But there are some ancient deadly microbes that still remain an urgent problem nowadays all around the world. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One and a half million deaths in 2014. And OK, OK, I know, the first reaction I always get is like, ""Wait, aren\'t there antibiotics?"" or ""I heard there is even a vaccine; is this disease still dangerous to us after all?"" The answer is yes; tuberculosis is closer than you think. Because of some mysterious genetic phenomenon, there are people that can carry around this microbe their entire lives without developing any symptoms, and there are people that develop symptoms straight ahead after infection. Let me give you a real example of a tuberculosis microepidemic. Let\'s say a person somehow got infected. He works as a teacher in a junior school. Half a year later, one of his pupils develops symptoms. A few months later, the older sister of the pupil. A few more months later, two friends of the sister. This is how it spreads. When I was just starting my research on this topic, I myself was very surprised to know that tuberculosis worldwide remains one of the major health concerns, that on the list of infectious diseases,  it is the second most common death cause after HIV. Yes, the fight continues. Did you know we have a tuberculosis clinic right here in Latvia, just outside Riga, where many doctors and other specialists fight tuberculosis on a daily basis? To finally beat this harmful bacteria, it is crucial to understand how it evolved, how it developed resistance to antibiotics, how it spread. And these are the questions where biomolecular archaeology can help us a lot. At the moment, working in the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, we have managed to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one archaeological sample from the 17th century. We are now in the process of defining its whole genome, so we can understand what type of tuberculosis reigned at that time over the Latvian territories and where it came from. Obviously, biomolecular archaeology impacts humanities as well, such as history and anthropology. These, for example, are the excavations on the Saint Ģertrūdes Cemetery a few years ago. They started very spontaneously. There was an idea to build a shopping center in that area, and there was also information that there might be some medieval burial sites. So the Latvian Institute of History received a request to check it out. And they did actually find a medieval burial site, quite a massive one. Our archaeologists dug out over 500 skeletons, and found 2,000 more skeletons buried separately in a giant wooden box. But what was it? This couldn\'t be war because the skeletons lacked war lesions on their bones. Was it hunger? Epidemic? Archaeology itself cannot take this research any further, we have to intervene with biomolecular methods. Only then can we trace the true reason. The research process that implements the goals of the science is fascinating, even by itself. It all starts with ancient bones and teeth from cemeteries all around Latvia. We then cut out small pieces of these bones and shred them in special scientific mills to get bone powder. We then extract all the DNA that is captured in a specific bone powder sample, and then we sequence it. Sequencing is the process where the machine reads the DNA code and translates it into a four-letter code. By the way, it is absolutely fascinating how all genetic information of human beings and all other living creatures on the planet Earth can be written down using the alphabet containing four letters only. It\'s absolutely not surprising that the result of the sequencing is absolutely unreadable - gigabytes of text consisting of these four letters. It then takes time and effort to analyze these data with a variety of computational methods and programming approaches. And at the very end, we get a pretty readable list of all the microorganisms from a specific sample. The field of my research contains three sciences at once: archaeology, biology and computer science, all mixed, merged and connected. It\'s like the science itself merging and connecting humanity throughout centuries. Science is like a pyramid: you cannot lay the upper block without a foundation of the blocks beneath. And building this pyramid of healthcare throughout the entire human civilization, I believe biomolecular archaeology just opened up a new frontier for us. Where do we go from here? It\'s a question of choice, but I believe that any destination holds fascinating discoveries. But just for now, please remember that you are never alone. (Laughter) You\'ve got a hundred trillion friends that are always there for you. Think about it next time you want to wash your hands. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

No big fishes, no fishes at all because we have fished them quicker than they reproduce.', '00:17': 'Today, I want to propose a strategy to save sea life and the idea has a lot to do with economics. In 1999, there was a little place called Cabo Pulmo in Baja California, in Mexico which was an underwater desert. Fishermen were frustrated by not having enough fishing. So, they decided to do something nobody expected. Instead of spending more time at sea searching for the last fish, they decided to stop fishing completely. They created a national park at sea, a marine reserve.', '00:50': ""When we came back to Cabo Pulmo ten years later, this is what we saw. What had been an underwater wasteland had become a kaleidoscope of color and life. We saw it come back to its pristine state in just ten years including the return of the biggest predators such as groupers, sharks, horse mackerel... Wow! It's an extraordinary place."", '01:18': 'If you scuba dive, go to Cabo Pulmo. Those visionary fishermen are now earning more money through tourism.', '01:27': ""When we can align economic needs with conservation miracles can happen. And we have seen similar recoveries throughout the world. I spent 20 years studying human impact on the sea. But seeing with my own eyes the regeneration of places like Cabo Pulmo gave me hope, so I decided, ten years ago, to abandon my position as a university professor to dedicate my life to protecting more places at sea, like these. In the past ten years our National Geographic, Pristine Seas team have been exploring, studying, documenting the wildest places at sea and working with government to protect them. All these places are already protected, and they cover a total surface of the size of half Canada. These places are the Yellowstones and the Serengetis of the sea. They are places where you jump into the water and immediately are surrounded by sharks. And that's good, it's good! Because sharks are a sign of a healthy ecosystem. These places are time machines that show us the sea from 500 years ago, from 1,000 years ago. But they also show us how the sea of the future could be. Because the sea has an extraordinary regenerative capacity. We have seen incredible recoveries in just a few years. What we have to do is protect more endangered places so they can be wild and full of life again."", '03:01': 'So, the question is: ""Is there any way of accelerating sea protection?"" Because today just the 2 percent of the sea is protected and that\'s not enough. Studies suggest that we need to protect at least 30 percent of the sea, not just to save sea life, but ourselves, too. Because the sea gives us food, and it gives us over the half of the oxygen we breathe. It absorbs much of the carbon pollution we release into the atmosphere. We need a healthy sea to survive.', '03:33': ""So, is there a way to accelerate protecting the sea? I think there is. And one of the solutions involves looking at international waters. Coastal countries have the authority over 200 nautical miles from the coast. Everything beyond that is called international waters or the high seas, too, shown in dark blue on this map. It's two-thirds of the ocean. No country is in charge of the high seas, but everyone is. Since it's a bit like the wild west, a lot of stuff happens there, and nobody controls anything."", '04:05': 'There are two kinds of fishing, mainly, at the high seas: at the bottom and at the surface. Bottom trawling is the most destructive practice on the planet. Supertrawlers, the biggest ships on the sea, have nets so large they can hold a dozen 747 planes. Those huge nets destroy everything in their path including deep-sea coral, which lives in submarine mountains and can be thousands of years old. Surface fishing focuses mostly on species that migrate from the high seas to the coastal waters, to the water of countries, such as tunas and sharks. Many of those are endangered species because they have been fished too much.', '04:48': ""But who fishes them? Who fishes at the high seas? Until now, it was difficult to know it exactly. Countries have not been transparent concerning long-distance fishing. Today, however, satellite technology allows us to track ships individually. And this is a revolution. This is the first time we are presenting the data you're about to see. I'm going to show you the routes of two ships fishing throughout a year using an automatic satellite positioning system. This is a ship fishing tunas and sharks for months around the south coast of the African continent. A few months later, the ship goes to Japan to replenish supplies and a while after, it's fishing around Madagascar. This other ship is a Russian trawler that fishes cod in Russian waters and also in international waters in the North Atlantic. Thanks to Global Fishing Watch we have been able to track more than 3,600 ships from more than 20 countries that were fishing at the high seas. Global Fishing Watch uses satellite positioning and artificial intelligence to automatically detect whether a ship is fishing or navigating. Depending on the kind of moves, we also know what kind of fishing it is."", '06:10': ""So, along with a group of international colleagues, scientists and economists, we decided to investigate who is fishing at the high seas and who benefits from it. My colleague Juan Mayorga from the University of California in Santa Barbara has produced detailed maps of fishing effort. Effort means how much time and fuel it takes to fish in each point of the sea. We have maps for each country that fishes in the high seas: China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain represent almost 80 percent of the fishing effort in the high seas. When we join all the countries, this is what we get: the global map of fishing effort. We know the identity of each ship on the database -- that's how we know the length of the ship, the tonnage, the engine power, how many crew members are on board... With this, we can calculate the staff cost, the fuel cost, etc. This is why, for the first time, we were able to calculate the costs of fishing on the high seas. The darker the red, the higher the cost."", '07:14': 'Colleagues from the University of British Columbia have illustrated how much each country is fishing. We also know the price of the fish when it leaves the ship. Combined with the effort data, we have been able to calculate, also for the first time, the profit, the income from fishing on the high seas. We have cost and we have income, thus, for the first time, too, we were able to calculate the profitability of fishing on the high seas, the net economic profit.', '07:46': ""I'm going to show you another map. The red color means that we are losing money by fishing in that area of the ocean. The blue color means that fishing is profitable there. There it is. It seems pretty profitable, right? But there are two important factors that we have to take into account. The first is: recent researches have revealed the use of forced labor or modern slavery on the high seas. Companies use modern slavery to reduce cost and get more profit. Secondly: each year, governments subsidize fishing on the high seas with over 4000 million dollars."", '08:28': ""Let's go back to the profits map. If we pretend that there is no slavery, that people are paid minimum wage, and deduct the government subsidies from our calculation, the map becomes this. Half of fishing on the high seas is not profitable. In fact, subsidies are four times bigger than the benefits. What this economic analysis reveals is that, practically, the entirety of fishing on the high seas makes no sense. What country, what government in its right mind would subsidize and support an industry cling to exploitation and fundamentally destructive? And it's not that profitable either."", '09:18': ""So... Why don't we close all international waters to fishing? Let's create a gigantic marine reserve on the high seas. Two thirds of the global ocean. Studies from the University of California suggest that such reserve would help the species in the high seas that migrate, such as tuna, and part of that growth in abundance would help to repopulate the coastal waters of the countries and the catch of those species would also rise, as well as the benefits, because the cost of fishing would decrease and the fish that large countries are now fishing in the wild west would be fished by the coastal countries. And well, the ecological benefits would be huge: to provide a refuge of two-thirds of the ocean for species of predators, such as tunas and sharks, which are essential to the health of the ecosystem."", '10:14': ""So, protecting the high seas, the international waters, would have ecological, economic and social benefits. But, the truth is that most fishing companies don't care about the environment. They would earn more money if they didn't fish on the high seas. Moreover, this would not affect our ability to feed our growing population, because fishing on the high seas represents only 5 percent of global marine catch since the high seas are not as productive as the coastal waters. And the high seas catch is sold as high-standing products, such as the tuna sashimi and shark fin soup. The high seas catch does not contribute to global food security."", '11:10': 'So, how are we going to do this? How are we going to protect the international waters? Right now, negotiators in the United Nations are starting discussions for a new treaty for the conservation in international waters. But this should not happen at closed doors. This is our big opportunity, and we all must ensure that our countries will support the conservation of international waters. There is a precedent. In 2016, 24 countries and the European Union agreed to protect the Ross Sea, the wildest place in the waters surrounding Antarctica, full of wildlife such as orcas, leopard seals, penguins, and those included fishing countries like China, Russia, Spain and Japan, but they decided that protecting that unique place was more beneficial than exploiting it for little profit. That is exactly the kind of international cooperation we will need. We can do it again.', '12:17': 'If in 20 years our children randomly jumped in any place of the sea, what would they see? An underwater desert, like most of our ocean today, or an abundance of life? Our legacy for the future.', '12:34': 'Thank you.', '12:35': '(Applause)', '12:38': 'Thank you.', '12:39': '(Applause)'}",

She's six years old, and asked me for a camera to take a picture of them. It was easier for her to farewell her toys if she could take a picture before giving them away. Because she doesn't want to forget them. Because pictures help us remember. We grab our cell phones to snap when we feel something is special. When something moves us, we feel the urge to capture what we feel and keep it in an image, in a picture. However, we don't print photos on paper like we used to do, we share them in social networks, or we upload them to the cloud. Photography turned into something intangible, something virtual. But, what happens when we lose or erase our digital photos? Those in your computer, in that hard disk or in your phone. Is there anybody here who never lost a photo? What would happen if, for some reason we would lose all of our parents' photos or other loved ones who are no longer with us? How are we to remember them? Going back to our photos from the past is like opening the doors to a dimension where lots of memories we seem to forget still remain. And those images from the past, those cherished treasures can help us propel ourselves into the future, as well. I am a nighttime photographer. I make portraits under moonlight, in nature, close to the water. I ask the people I photograph to remain still and silent for several minutes amidst darkness. Meanwhile, I walk around them to light them up and light up the landscape with lanterns. It's a moment of quietness and connection. I went off to live in the islands of the Paraná River Delta for two years. I took with me an old camera without knowing very well where I was going, neither what was I to find there. And in time I came to know the islanders, and I invited them to be photographed under the full moon to recreate their daily life routines and jobs, but at night. And I took photos of loggers, hunters and dreamers. People living in isolation, whose only direct relationship is with water, to the rhythm of the river highs and lows. And that visual work in the Delta led me to travel around the world, and took me to Japan. I was searching for a new story to tell. I wanted to work again with a community which had some connection with water. And it happened that the curator of my exhibition, Ihiro Hayami, had relatives in a small fisher town and went with me for a visit. Ōtsuchi is located between the mountains and the sea. It's a fifteen-thousand-people town that in March 2011 went through the worst tragedy in its history. It was washed off by a tsunami with waves tall as a five-story building. Even though the alarms went off many people didn't believe it would be so strong, and remain in their homes. As a consequence many people died, close to a 10 percent of the population. And 70 percent of houses were washed away. This is why every local in Ōtsuchi has either friends or family who died in the tsunami. The power of the waves pulled the houses off their base and the sea gulped them up. Survivors were left with no shelter and had to endure a winter with temperatures below zero Celsius. Amidst this chaos and total destruction many people were trying to save their family photos. An officer of Japan's Self Defense Forces recovers a photo album inside a house in total ruin. There it was the picture of a child. The officer holds the album as if he were holding the child. I traveled to Ōtsuchi with my daughter who was five month old at the time. And the contrast of a baby in the middle of such desolation was impressive. People would take her off of my arms in order to kiss her. And I'd wonder how to tell this story that happened a year and a half ago. What could be positive out of such level of destruction. The first thing I found were big piles of rubble made of all kind of things. Twisted objects that speak about life as it used to be in Ōtsuchi. Like this vending machine or this fishing elements, car remains ... or what's left of a house. A lamp turned into a Moebius strip, the symbol of infinite time. As a contrast to these mountains of rubble there was this town flattened by water. The skeletons of the houses, marked on the ground were empty spaces, filled with stories. So I invited the survivors to go back to those spaces where their houses or workplaces used to exist. And many accepted, but in general, the kids didn't want to. I photographed them during the night as they remained silent and still during the ten minutes each photo took. The scenes were so sad, nothing had color. She is Haruko Okano, a librarian, and she's sitting on the remains of Ōtsuchi's Library, where she worked. This is the Second Volunteers Firefighters Squad of Ōtsuchi inside of what was the fire station. The fireman standing up was in charge of closing the anti-tsunami gates. This is Yoshihiro Ogayu, monk of Kogan-ji temple. The temple was a refuge in case of tsunami but even so it was destroyed. His dad and his son died there. When that first trip to Ōtsuchi was over I found a photo album in the middle of the street. It had laid there for a year and a half without having anyone pick it up. It was all wet, heavy and it stank just like a dead animal. It was tainted with color bubbles gushing from the photos that blended together. I took a picture of it without giving it much of a thought and I came back. Once in Buenos Aires, the Ōtsuchi experience felt much like a far away dream. It filled me up with doubt: Why did I have to tell this story, if I came from the other end of the world? What did it had to do with me? Why had I photographed the survivors in black and white if the reference of my work is color? And while I made myself these questions, my own life began to crumble. Soon after breakup, my daughter's mother went off to live in another country. So I took on myself Lara's upbringing, she was a one-year-old baby. Project Ōtsuchi was put on hold, because now it was me the one who had to survive and reinvent myself. And some months later, revisiting the work the family photo album image popped up again. But in this second view I grasped it in a different way. I thought I saw a painter's palette. So I took the main colors of that album to create my own color palette. And I used those colors created by the force of the tsunami to color the images of the survivors. And little by little, all the gray scenes turned into something colorful. I used color as a bridge to connect the present and the past, as the hub between their photos and mine. Now I was feeling connected with Ōtsuchi once again. Two years passed since until I was able to return to Japan  to search for other recovered photos and find new colors to paint with. There I met Mikio Komukai, a nice man who had this NGO that was recovering family photos to send them back to their owners. And with his help and the permission of Ōtsuchi's government I gained access to that impressive archive of thousand of destroyed photos. Contemplating those pictures I realized the intangible damage the people of Ōtsuchi were facing; the damage to their memory and identity. Those blurred images were the measure of their loss. The firefighters of Ōtsuchi. I traveled a total of six times to finish the project and publish a book. And this is the last picture I took with my two assistants, Mayumi Suzuki and Kazuhiko Chikaoka, who both lost their parents to the tsunami. We built an arch with plastic tubes which they arranged in different positions over the remains of this house. And if you look carefully at the photo you will see that their hands are holding this house of light. In 2016 the government of Ōtsuchi invited me to show my project, but I had a feeling that it was not over. There was something left to do. So I suggested that we put together a collective exhibition which we set up in the gymnasium of a temporary school. And we invited high school students and the people in town to take photos. Now the kids did want to join in. We gave them disposable cameras with one assignment: to tell their lives in pictures, their intimate whereabouts. Five years away from the tsunami there were children back in the streets taking photos, recording its life. And together, in community, we created a small photo archive of what Ōtsuchi is today. The people in town took pictures to create new memories: The memories of the future of Ōtsuchi. As for me, I started my own photo album telling my life and my travels with Lara. And here we are in Japan, saying goodbye to the sea of Ōtsuchi. Thank you very much. (Applause)""}",

How a house could be built? And how we could improve with the current technology, the quality of our living spaces, the affordablility, and share these with greater markets and people. We think that this is, the present and the future of architecture. And, this house that we\'ve built in Madrid, is our manifesto, our starting point. We prefabricated towards this house, You\'re seeing a civilian engineering parts, that perfectly assembled and balanced, to demonstrate that how prefabrication could be, the way to create amazing, inspiring, and affordable spaces to live. This house was based in these engineering parts, balanced in consonance and in harmony, in equilibrium with this rock of granite of 20 tons that put all their parts together. This is our house in Madrid. The Hemeroscopium House that is full of air, and full of life, to enable it, the structure, that as you can see, defers very little the house and the structure that created it. This house is a space to share with our family, It\'s a space to share in conspiracy, in communal with outdoors. in very intimate relationship with nature. This is the space that we were living in Spain and space that we would like to have here in Boston when we came at the full of harmony. This house has been built in Madrid, and when we came to Boston, we were looking for a same space, a similar space to live. We started struggling with ""0"", in the search of housings around. MIT where I work, POPLab is found that everyone want to be closer with good schools like this one, and we discovered how insane the prices are, how expensive these houses become, and also how these houses were responding to a(n) old American dream. a lifestyle, a technology, and a formal unspecialized exact was not there where we understood house should be. And also when you come as an migrant to United States, you don\'t have financial history and this was part of the problem that we have to solve so we actually went low to high. In the sea of browser, and we found the cheapest place in the area -- I think it was a cheapest place in Massachusetts and this was how our dream house. A three base garage very... unfinished yet, but with a lot of potential. (laugh) so we thought that we could build a house of our dreams I recruited a group of young architects, and tell them ""let\'s build the technology that could be available and fit the house in Brookline."" It was the same being, but very light, that could be lifted and transported easily, and that could be estrangedly insulated to the weather in Boston. So we got hands on, and without being skilled to build a house, we crafted a prefabrication putting together their technologies from their North-Amarican tradition of building houses, with our European ones. Framing but in steel instead of in wood. creating thick walls but very light filled with forth and insulating materials that could be clad with cement boards. It\'s a different material plate, but what we created was a very affordable lightweight technology that could be packed in a container, because we are going to the move to United States but not only moving our staff, our furnishing, our memory, we are going to move their full house. So we packed it in containers, And we made the trip to United States, Their house in one side and our family in the other one. When we arrived to Brookline, two blocks away from this place, It was like receiving an Amazon pack, instead of a goodie where the full house that we had to and pack. Craned and assembled together. This is what we did in Madrid, but with these pieces that came with the kitchen, the bathroom, the closets, the furnishing, everything was embedded into these walls. These walls had to be assembled with total precision as a Swiss watch. And it took 7 days, of craning, and putting all these parts together in perfect balance. We think that this is the way, architecture should move on to make it really affordable, real technological, and overall, exciting. We think that architecture has to inspire and create a point of space that make our lives better. There the house was constructed above a garage, but the garage is still there. It\'s coated with a thin layer of vegetation that hopefully will grow next spring. But it was recycle, it wasn\'t turned on, we just created a big room above, where all our family could again enjoy all their activities without separating ourselves into rooms. A big room where we could have our meals, play, study, do some work, and where we could enjoy also, the light and the vistas from the neighbors, trees, and where at night, even all that activity after their dinner, could be transformed in to a fantastic bedroom. The bed comes from the wall and we still enjoy that big space, that we created above. Good night. (applause). (applause).'}",

Men from the extremist group, Boko Haram, kidnapped 276 young, innocent schoolgirls. Today, 218 are still missing.', '00:33': 'I worked in and out of Nigeria for three years starting in 2007, and I remember seeing the kids going to school along dirt roads. They had smiles, they were polite, they were dressed neatly. They often talked about the books they were reading. That was tough on the kids, but they went to school for a safe place. They went to school for dreams of a better future.', '01:04': ""But turning those dreams into reality in Nigeria is difficult, because 61% of the people live at poverty level. Compare that to the US at 15%. The annual income is slightly below $6,000; compare that to the US, of $56,000. Now you see the problem. But I wasn't there in Nigeria trying to resolve an income disparity. I wasn't there trying to volunteer for a charity, or to set up a nonprofit organization. I was there to promote trade where it's very limited."", '01:48': 'I strongly believe when communities are isolated from the global economy, they could become the breeding grounds of groups like Boko Haram. Just the definition of ""Boko Haram"" stands for: ""Western education is forbidden."" That isolation in itself is dangerous. I ask you one question: Would those girls still be in school in Chibok if the conditions were different that gave rise to Boko Haram? You know, you have to wonder, what if Nigerian people had access to gain full employment? Or villages like Chibok were more integrated in the global economy? Or families could break that poverty cycle through jobs and education?', '02:40': ""Trade is a powerful weapon. Trade can fight against poverty and injustice. Trade is the gun to combat human trafficking. Trade provides medicine to the sick. Trade provides a roof for people in need of shelter. Trade is the answer to give dignity back to millions of unprivileged people. Trade is a humanitarian's strongest weapon."", '03:10': 'I work for a company that facilitates trade in 220 countries, and I\'ve personally assisted trade in 46 of them. I\'ve seen trade in action. I see trade work. But you don\'t have to take my word for it: economists have been studying it for years. In his book ""The World Is Flat,"" Tom Friedman said when countries trade with each other, they\'re the same supply chain, and they don\'t inflict military damage on each other. But Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945, said it best: ""When goods do not cross borders, armies do.""', '03:58': 'So what is this magical weapon I call ""trade""? It\'s simple: I have something you want, you have something I need. We make an exchange. But the question is: How can something so simple have such a dramatic impact on poverty and security?', '04:21': ""Let's start with poverty. There's no better example than China. Before China adopted economic reform 37 years ago, it maintained policies to keep the country poor. Then in 1979, it implemented economic reform. It allowed international trade and foreign investment. And we all know what happened -- China's the fastest-growing economy. But here's something: In that nation, in 1990, the annual income was only $980. Fast-forward to 2015, it's a little over $14,000. The poverty levels decreased [from] 84% from 1980 to 10% in 2013. The unemployment rate is at 4.1%, slightly below 4.9% of that in the US."", '05:19': 'Let\'s talk security. I started traveling in Colombia in 2010, and people were saying, ""Are you scared? Are you nervous?"" And that\'s because, 10 to 15 years earlier, the drug lords and the drug cartel would kidnap and torture people. But then the government pumped in economic resources, and they stabilized their political platform. That made a huge difference. I feel very safe going to Colombia, seeing customers.', '05:48': ""In fact, I just got back from Bogotá last week. Colombia thanks trade for improved security, reduction of poverty, and a very attractive image to the world. And I have a beautiful example of that. Colombia exported $1.3 billion of roses and flowers in 2013, with 75% coming to the US. So you see, trade clearly is a powerful weapon to fight poverty and crime. But it doesn't stop there."", '06:25': 'If I was to say ""Haiti,"" what would pop into your mind? Earthquake, hunger, poverty. Would anyone think of fashion? In 2010, the earthquake killed 230,000 Haitians, and displaced 1.5 million. Julie Colombino from Orlando, Florida went there to help. She saw humanitarian aid pour in, but she knew it wasn\'t sustainable. She started a nonprofit company called ""REBUILD globally,"" and this nonprofit taught Haitians how to make sandals out of old tires, which are very abundant there.', '07:10': ""From that nonprofit company, spun Deux Mains, a profit company, and that caught the eye of Kenneth Cole. Haiti has something the fashion world needs. They have great designs, they have top-quality craftsmanship, they have eco-friendly products. Kenneth Cole has the global brand and the distribution model to give Deux Mains shoes to the world. Trade, pure and simple. Deux Mains has made more than 2,400 pairs of sandals for Kenneth Cole, and now is in negotiation with Ron Jon, another global brand. These sandals I have on today? Yes, they've got the old tires on the bottom of them. But my purchase was made to help Haiti out of poverty. My $70 I paid wasn't a charitable contribution, it wasn't a handout. It was basic economics. It was trade at work."", '08:09': ""Julie Colombino shared with me that for every 250 pairs of shoes produced, one more Haitian is employed. So that got me thinking. In the United States, each of us buys seven and a half pairs of shoes a year. That's 2.4 billion pairs of shoes. Now just think: If one-tenth of 1% was produced in Deux Mains, that would be 2.4 million pairs of shoes. But more importantly, it would pump $120 million into the Haitian economy, and give almost 10,000 people a job. That type of employment in Haiti would have a ripple effect. And as workshop supervisor Jolina Auguste told me, the more sandals they sell, the less thieves on the street."", '09:05': ""So you see, when people have a job, security, money, they don't take other people's stuff. They don't resort to crime to survive. They don't get caught up with the drug lords like in Colombia, or terrorism that teaches them how to use AK-47s. The Global Terrorist Index report in 2015 said economic conditions play a very important part in one's decision to pursue violent extremism. The report also says Boko Haram is the most deadly terrorist organization in the world. And it recruits from the most economically marginalized regions in Nigeria."", '09:52': ""But on the other hand, if there is industrial growth, there's less domestic and international terrorism. According to a 2015 study that was published in the Oxford Economic Papers, when industrial growth increases by 1%, domestic terrorism decreases by 1%. So what does that mean? When communities gain access to the global economy through trade, they reap so many benefits."", '10:28': 'I stand here and ask you one last question: If Chibok were more connected through trade, and those young men who joined Boko Haram had an option to get a job in the formal economy, would those girls still be in school? I think so. Trade would have given them a weapon to fight terrorism. Trade would have given them hope.', '10:57': 'Thank you.', '10:58': '(Applause)'}",

And in general, we said whatever came to our heads. I wanted to be an astronaut. But that didn\'t work out. I ended up becoming a doctor, a neurologist and a researcher. And the question I always asked myself: What are the limits of human adaptation to extreme environments such as high or low temperatures, high heights, extreme depth, even outer space? As you can imagine, I don\'t have any patients, because you need to be in great health to be able to face such an extreme environment. This theme, became the research focus that I have followed throughout my whole career in science. My work place? The European Astronaut Centre of the European Space Agency. Who are my patients? The team of European astronauts. By the way, do you know that there are astronauts in space right now? Yes or no? Yes! Since 2001, there has been a permanent presence of humans in space. Six astronauts from various nationalities spend six months in the International Space Station. Every six months, there are three that come down and three that go up. The last three actually just arrived yesterday to the ISS station. The ISS, or what we call it, the International Space Station, is a grand scientific laboratory. It it right here, in a ""suburb"" of the Earth. It\'s is flying at 400 kilometers away at a velocity of 17,400 mph. The astronauts go 16 times around the Earth in 24 hours. At this velocity, instead of in 14 hours, tomorrow I could go home to my house in Paris in 24 minutes. It would be awesome! (Laughter) The astronauts -- Who are the astronauts? They are professionals, high level technicians. They are experimenters, because they perform the scientific experiments that we doctors and researches design. They are also the subjects of our experiments, because we do experiments on them. The question that you will ask, of course is: if the astronauts are all healthy, why do they need a doctor? They actually do, because my work within the research, like those of my colleagues, is to enable the astronauts to overcome their fiscal physical and psychological problems so they can live and work in space. An environment for which evolution didn\'t prepare us. On the Earth there are two fundamental factors; the force of gravity that has conditioned our entire anatomy, the rotation of Earth and the way it alternates between light and darkness, that has conditioned all of our physiology. The force of gravity has conditioned our anatomy giving us our symmetrical body, more or less, our sense of balance, the skeleton, our muscle mass, all of this is conditioned by gravity and the fight against it. There is no gravity in space, so what will happen? They will have balance problems, they will have decalcification. The skeleton that\'s up there will have a loss of muscle mass. So... we have designed a series of physical exercises with very precise protocols which take into account all of the sectors of the body, so they can stay in shape. Because, in addition, the astronauts aren\'t weighed down, so they stretch, growing about one inch. And this produces pain. Short people don\'t have expectations, because when you return, you shrink -- (Laughter) So, at this moment, we are all working to ease this type of pain, creating a ""super skin suit"", that is the suit that the astronauts use here, that we tried for the first time three months ago. I was telling you about the rotation of the Earth, and the alternating day and night. When this alternation is missing, all of our physiology is affected. And, of course, that together with all of the circadian rhythms and all of the physiological variables. From the first flights to space, we learned that the astronauts didn\'t sleep well. The quantity and quality were altered. The body temperature as well. Sleep, temperature, metabolism, nutrition -- because with all of these metabolic changes that I was mentioning, nutrition is affected. Above all, the environment of the space station, with the long working hours from 8 am to 10 pm, so they can execute all of the protocols, that we give them to do. And also the constant noise of ventilation, up to 60 to 70 decibels to circulate the air. The light that isn\'t that bright. However, in 30 years of research, we have been able to improve a few of the working conditions. The simple things: a comfortable sleeping bag, which produces in space the same pleasing sensation that we feel when we go to lie down and are between the sheets. Also, the nutrition: It\'s not only to cover nutritional and metabolic needs -- because you have to be really hungry to want to eat this -- (Laughter) But also, to take well into account the psychological aspect and the taste. That\'s why the astronaut in red, Luca Parmitano, who is a friend of mine, brought to the station his Mom\'s lasagna, to share with the entire crew. That\'s a really special moment for them. And we realized that we as doctors and researchers, have made some progress. At this time, we are able to enable astronauts to live and work for a period of time in space and bring them back to Earth, all in all, in good health. I see a lot of young people in this room, that are very lucky because at this time, we are starting a new era in space exploration. I told you that the Space Station was in the suburbs. We are returning to the Moon now, on our way to Mars. Did you realize this? Only 12 men have had the luck to walk and work on the Moon for a few hours or almost three days. The highlight images that you are seeing right now, are not science fiction. Our daily work at this time, from what we are seeing is going to happen: the first construction robots will recover the lunar dust, the regolith, to build the first shelter -- starting in 2025. After the first building is done, three years after that, man will arrive. First, for a few days. And later, they will stay for a few months. This is very fast in the video -- it will take 3 months to do it. There they will have their little house. For us it is a huge challenge. We have to anticipate new training protocols so the astronauts, when they are walking on the Moon, will be ready for anything that can happen. We also have to have or engineer health monitoring systems to be able to check on them, to detect any problems, and to be able to diagnose them. And if a problem exists, we have to intervene therapeutically, without any doctor close by. That is something very important to us. And this trip to the Moon is only the first chapter, to continue on to Mars, the target. Did you know? After many years of working in the space field, at NASA and the European Space Agency, I am starting to realize with my colleges, that at this time, we are facing the same type of problems that our predecessors had, the doctors for the Apollo program. The Apollo program, in my youth, like all of my generation, we dreamed about this program. And inevitably, this project to put a man on the Moon, influenced my choice and professional path. And now this program is still relevant. It\'s because of this, above all for the young people, I want to tell you that I really hope that you can dream and that you can live by it. In this short time that I was here with you, I hope that I have passed on a little of my enthusiasm and passion. Thank you very much. (Applause)'}",

I\'d like to talk to you about laughter and the importance of laughter as a skill. And to do so, I\'m going to start by discussing some American foreign policy because that\'s always - (Laughter) absolutely hilarious. (Laughter) Back in 1995, towards the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia, they\'d been a very ill-tempered speech given by Boris Yeltsin at the UN about the involvement of the Russian Federation in NATO, and then he had a meeting with Bill Clinton, in which some of these same issues were coming up, and it was considered to be, likely to be a bit of a row. So, what actually happened when these two men came out? They gave a press conference about their summit. And can we learn anything about laughter if we watch this? (Video) Host: Good afternoon. Bill Clinton: Mr. President. (On stage) Sophie Scott: Watch Bill Clinton. (Video) Boris Yeltsin: (In Russian) Ladies and gentlemen, SS: Yeltsin - (Video) BY: (In Russian) dear journalists, SS: ... doesn\'t sound very happy. (Video) BY: (In Russian) First of all, I have to say that I was coming to this meeting at the invitation of the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, not with the same optimism as I am feeling right now. Interpreter: I want to say, first of all, that when I came here to the United States for this visit at the invitation of the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, I did not, at that time, have the degree of optimism with which I now am departing. BY: And this is all because of you - SS: (Laughter) (Video) BY: because even in all today\'s newspapers, based on my yesterday\'s statement at the United Nations, you predicted that our meeting today would be a failure. Interpreter: And this is all due to you, because coming from my statement yesterday in the United Nations, and if you looked at the press reports, one could see that what you were writing was that today\'s meeting with President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster. (Laughter) SS: A big laugh. (Video) BY: And now, for the first time, I\'m telling you that you have failed. Interpreter: But now, for the first time, I can tell you that you\'re a disaster. (Laughter) SS: Enormous laugh. (Laughter) Helpless with the laughter. (Laughter) (Video) BC: Be sure you get the right attribution there. (Laughter) SS: Boris Yeltsin now starts laughing. (Laughter) (Laughter) No one\'s able to get anything done for a while now. That tends to happen with laughter. (Laughter) (Laughter) These guys. (Laughter) So what is laughter? Clearly, that was quite an enjoyable thing in a rather surprising setting. Laughter, actually, is a very interesting behaviour. We tend to associate it with comedy and humour, but laughter is primarily a social behaviour. You\'re 30 times more likely to laugh with somebody else than if you\'re on your own. And frequently, this means your laughter happens when you\'re in conversation, because that tends to be what happens when you\'re with other people. And very often, that laughter is simply contagious laughter. You laugh just because other people are laughing. You just catch a laugh. You\'re much more likely to catch a laugh from someone you know than someone you don\'t know, and in conversations. We\'re still currently not laughing at jokes and humour with punchlines necessarily. We\'re laughing to show agreement. We\'re laughing to show understanding. We\'re laughing to show that we agree and we see where somebody\'s coming from. We share that experience. We laugh much more with people we know and people we feel comfortable around. We laugh - we don\'t laugh rather if we\'re feeling exposed or we\'re feeling awkward. When we\'re comfortable, when we can relax, when we\'re with people familiar to us, people we like, people with whom we share affection, we laugh even more. When we\'re children, we learn to laugh, and we learn to laugh primarily in play. And play is a very important behaviour, and we frequently use laughter to indicate that we are playing. The same behaviour could simply be pure aggression (Laughter) where not for the marking of it as play. And this is done with laughter primarily. We will use laughter, not just to show that we\'re part of the same group of somebody - we like them, we understand them, we agree with them. We will also use laughter to sort of show we understand that they may be trying to make us laugh; we pick up on their intentions. And we\'ll also use laughter to try and control situations. We\'ll use laughter to try and make ourselves feel better. And it only works if everybody joins in. If one person\'s going, ""Hahahahaha,"" and no one else is laughing, that tends not to make anybody feel better at all. (Laughter) If everybody joins in, laughter is actually an effective way of improving the positive mood of a group of people. And people can use laughter because of this link, with sort of de-escalation from stress. People will use laughter to show that they\'re OK. ""I\'m angry that you\'ve poured yellow paint all over me. I\'m delighted. This is exactly how I hoped my day would go."" (Laughter) Charles Darwin, very interestingly, got a lot of stuff right about the sort of how we started to look at emotions in the study of psychology over the next 150 years after his writing. He wrote about things like anger and disgust and fear, but he also wrote a lot about laughter, and we largely ignored that. There\'s actually very, very little scientific research into laughter. But Charles Darwin thought that laughter was really important, and he thought that at its heart, it was an expression of joy; it\'s a joyful emotion. And it\'s joy in play, it\'s joy in company, it\'s joy in the company of those we love. I think it\'s really important to think about that when we think about laughter. We also think about how that could go wrong. Because we learn to laugh. Babies will laugh when they\'re tickled or somebody plays peek-a-boo with them. But it\'s a behaviour we can encourage. We learn what laughter means. We learn to understand laughter. And we can see that going wrong. So this is a study that I did with my colleague Essi Viding at UCL last year, where we were studying teenage boys who are at risk of psychopathy. They have conduct disorders, and they have high inputs called callous-unemotional traits. So they\'re not behaving well, and they don\'t care if they hurt people. And what we find, when they listen to laughter compared to control teenage boys, who are normally developing, is that behaviourally, they don\'t find laughter contagious. They don\'t join in when somebody else laughs, and they don\'t want to join in when somebody else laughs. If we look at their brain where normally, when people hear laughter, you can see this priming response, you can see people getting ready to join in, they show a significantly reduced effect. Now, we don\'t know, in this context, if we\'re seeing this because those boys have always had a problem learning to laugh because of these conduct disorders and these callous-unemotional traits that they have, has that affected how they engage with laughter, or have they never had the opportunity to learn to laugh? Had they not been laughed with? Have they not been played with? Of course, we need a lot more research to look into this. There\'s an even more extreme condition called ""gelotophobia,"" where people not only don\'t want to join in when they hear laughter, they are actively frightened and respond aggressively to laughter. They\'re the kind of person who\'s walking down the streets, hears laughter, think they\'re being laughed at and they punch that person. And you never find gelotophobia outside of the most profound psychological disturbances. So in fact, we can see laughter and the reaction to laughter spanning a huge different quality and properties of human experience, and kind of lives that we can live.  It can be an incredibly positive social tool, or it can be something that you fear depending on your experiences. So, thinking about that, can we go back to that bit of film and think about why on earth Bill Clinton was laughing. Well, from the start, he\'s watching Boris Yeltsin like a hawk. All his attention is on him. And he looks like - actually, he\'s waiting for a reason to laugh. And then he gets his reason, because Boris Yeltsin says his name, Bill Clinton, and he laughs then. It\'s pure laugh of recognition: ""Yes, ha ha ha, my name is Bill Clinton."" (Laughter) Don\'t knock it, if it gets a laugh, it gets a laugh. So that\'s his reason. He\'s got going. And then Boris Yeltsin says the line about that you thought it would be a disaster but you\'re the disaster. Actually, that\'s a mistranslation; he used the word ""failure,"" and it\'s mistranslated by the Russian-American interpreter. People have said that Bill Clinton is laughing at this mistranslation. I don\'t know if that\'s giving, but possibly he is. Most people probably didn\'t pick up on that. It\'s likely that he\'s now just using that as a reason both to escalate the laughter and also to reframe what is quite an insulting comment by Boris Yeltsin as a joke. He\'s de-escalating the situation and he\'s re-presenting it to us as: This guy is hilarious. (Laughter) It completely changes our perception and importantly Boris Yeltsin\'s perception of what\'s going on. Boris Yeltsin, ""So yeah, I am killing it here."" (Laughter) ""This is very funny.""  (Laughter) And he carries on; he now gets a smile out of Yeltsin who cracks, and then he gets his laugh. Boris Yeltsin starts to laugh, and he is laughing primarily here through pure contagion. For a while, they\'re both incapacitated by the laughter, and that happens with laughter; it will stop you doing anything else for a short amount of time. And then they go back. OK, they\'re doing OK. So why - why was Bill Clinton laughing? Well, we\'ve got the recognition, and then we\'ve got the the kind of comment, the joke of reframing, and that\'s actually really important. He is de-escalating and reframes the whole thing. The atmosphere was tense, and he turns that into a positive situation. So he\'s de-escalating the stress, and he\'s just reframing everything as ""This is great fun we\'re having, and this is just hilarious. This guy\'s so funny."" He\'s also showing that he is quite comfortable in that situation. We don\'t laugh when we feel exposed or awkward. So Clinton\'s showing he\'s confident: ""This is fine. You guys might have been worried about this. I know we\'re golden. This guy\'s hilarious."" And that really matters to us. We learn, when we are very, very young, to use our parents laughter as a way of working out whether a situation is serious or not. Children of 12 months old will use their parents laughter, or their absence of laughter, to work out if an unfamiliar situation is something they should worry about. We continue doing that, so it matters that Bill Clinton is doing this. And he\'s also showing that he\'s affiliated with Yeltsin. He\'s showing that he feels affection towards him. And Yeltsin does the same thing. We don\'t catch laughs off people we don\'t like. We don\'t catch laughs off people we don\'t know. So actually, they\'re marking their bond there. And the final point that I think is really intriguing is Bill Clinton, at no stage, makes it look like he\'s laughing at Boris Yeltsin. He goes to great pains to include him. He\'s not going, ""This guy is an idiot. Let\'s laugh at him."" It would mean something very, very different if he did. In fact, I think generally, in American foreign policy, anybody\'s foreign policy, don\'t laugh in the face of a premier state from another country. It\'s probably eight-o\'clock day-one of a rule. He includes him in that laughter. And this is a really important factor about laughter. Because laughter is about making and maintaining social bonds, people are very cautious about working out where they are in relation to that. And this does mean you can\'t just take a difficult situation and throw a squirt of laughter at it; you\'ve got to make sure people feel included in that laughter. They\'re not feeling excluded or offended by that laughter. And this leads us back to perhaps a more important aspect of laughter. It\'s an important social skill that we learn to do. We learn about the social use of laughter throughout our entire early adult life, and it\'s probably one of the more important social skills that we acquire. And we should probably take this a lot more seriously. We should think about the things that can affect our laughter. We can think about the things that we could do to encourage our understanding of our laughter. And perhaps the takeaway message is take laughter seriously. Think about your laughter. Don\'t undervalue or trivialise your laughter. It matters. It matters a lot. It can sound like friendship. It can sometimes sound a lot like love. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

So, I thought I\'d tell you just a little bit about the impact of light on our health. My lab uses fruit flies to study sleep and wake patterns, but what I want to talk today is primarily light and its impact on health. So, of course, we live on this planet that spins around its axis as it\'s orbiting the Sun. As a consequence of that, one of the basic facts of life on Earth is that you\'re exposed to light-dark cycles every single day. Here you see the side of the Earth that\'s facing the Sun, is light, and the other one is dark, and actually, I think we have so much light here that the dark side is kind of washed-out. But if the light was a little bit lower, you could see that there are lights all over the places on Earth, at least where there\'s solid ground, just not above water. And that\'s maybe a little bit more clear from this picture which is a composite Google image of Earth from above, at night, and I think that this is a really stunning image. It\'s stunningly beautiful, but it\'s also stunning to think about the amount of light that we\'re enveloping the Earth on, and, at the time of day when, for pretty much all of our evolutionary history, the Earth has been dark. There\'s this funny story that I don\'t know if it\'s true, but I like it, I think it\'s a good story, where in 1994, in LA, police started getting reports of people seeing a strange white cloud in the sky, and they didn\'t know what this was. They wondered if they should be worried. It turned out LA had just suffered a major earthquake which resulted in citywide blackouts. So, many people for the first time in many years, or perhaps the first time in their lives, had an unobstructed view of the night sky. In fact, what they were seeing was not a trail from some alien spaceship, but it was a glimpse of our own home galaxy, the Milky Way. This may sound quite incredible to you until I show you this next picture. Here\'s a picture that this guy, Todd Carlson, from Canada, took of his house, a fairly typical-looking house, a typical-looking sky, at least for those of us living in Boston, or surrounding areas. You can even make out some stars in the sky. In 2003, there was a blackout that affected large parts of the United States and Canada, and Todd Carlson lost his electricity, and he was smart enough to take a picture of his house at that time, and this is what it looked like. And again, here you can see this strange, white cloud in the sky which is the Milky Way. The lights that we are producing as humans, due to our ingenuity, are wiping out, basically, our view of these millions of stars in the sky. So, if we think about that, this is certainly a shame, because there are a few things that are more magnificent than a view of the night sky. But we should also think about what is this doing to our health if we\'re flooding ourselves with this amount of light pollution? So I want to I tell you that all throughout your bodies, in all of your organs, you have biological clocks that keep you in sync with the light-dark cycles of your environment that result from the Earth\'s rotation. And in your heads you have a master clock, a main clock that synchronizes all of these other clocks in your bodies. The way that this works is that light travels from a source, such as the Sun, or an artificial light source, through your eyes, and that light information is then conveyed to the brain, to the master clock that\'s in a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or the SCN. So in your eyes you of course have cells that help you see the stars, that help you form visible imagery. But you also have cells that are not a part of the visual-forming pathways, but rather their role is to capture light information and basically convey it to the brain, to tell the brain what time of day it is. So, how can I convince you that you have this clock? Well, if I closed you in a dark room where you would have no external source of light, no alarm clocks, no clocks of any kind, you would still retain rhythmic sleep and wake patterns at least for a little while, because your clock was previously trained to light-dark cycles and one of the main functions of the clock is to regulate behavioral rhythmicity. This, of course, is not an experiment that many of you would be willing to subject yourselves to, but, fortunately, there\'s an experiment that most of us have participated in, which is traveling across time zones. So, I like this quote that says, ""When you travel from America to Europe, your soul takes about three days longer to get there."" And I know this is certainly true when I travel from here to Serbia, my home country. It does take me several days basically, to feel normal, to feel aligned with the population that\'s living there. And this is because your clock takes a few days to get realigned with this new schedule. And, if you think about this, this makes sense, right? So, for pretty much all of our history, except for a blink of an eye, in our evolutionary history, nobody had a way of hopping from one continent to the other in a matter of hours. We\'re changing time zones so quickly, and in this case, nature\'s not really keeping up with what we are capable of doing. So, what is this clock? And why is it important to think about light? The clock is a molecular oscillator, the details here are not important at all, I don\'t want you to look at the names of these things on the board, but I want to point out that the clock is essentially the same in animals such as fruit flies, which my lab uses in our studies, and in mammals like mice or humans. And the first glimpses of the clock, the components of the clock, and the way that it ticks were gained in the fly, actually. What I want to stress here is that the clock is tuned by light. Some of the components of this clock are actually degraded, directly degraded by light. So, that results in the state of the clock essentially oscillating throughout the day and night. You can imagine if the composition of the clock, if some of the components are degraded, the composition of the clock will change between day and night. And then the outputs of the clock between day and night will be different. So, for instance, during the day, the state of your clock is such that you are suppressing production of melatonin, which is the hormone that helps you fall asleep, but also has other functions, such as anti-cancer and antioxidant properties. So light. Let\'s talk about blue light a little bit. When you\'re outside during the day, you\'re, of course, exposed to sunlight which consists of different wavelengths of light. But the one that\'s particularly important is blue light, because of its effect on our clock. Blue light also directly elevates your mood, it boosts your attention and your alertness. So blue light during the day is very, very good, and I\'d say that most of us don\'t spend enough time in a bright light outside. You should be for 30 to 60 minutes outside in bright light, so put some sunscreen on and go outside. The flip side of this is that when you come home at night I would dare guess that pretty much none of us spend the rest of the day when we come home, in darkness, and we\'re not in tune with the natural light and dark cycles, right? So, what we do normally is we use our computers, smartphones, tablets; we are in rooms that have high amounts of LED light. And, in particular, what\'s really bad is that these devices are very, very rich in blue light. So, what you\'re doing, every evening, when you\'re using these devices is you\'re essentially tricking your clock into thinking that it\'s still day. And since the clock during day and blue light suppress melatonin production, you\'re essentially doing that at night. Now, I\'m not naive enough to suggest you never use your computer at night, I know I wouldn\'t abide by that. But one thing that you can do, is you can turn the brightness of your screen in the evening, you can download programs that filter some of the blue light or you can use glasses that block some of the blue light. I have a little bit of news for you that maybe you\'ll perceive as bad, but I think it\'s actually very good, which is that you are very much like these guys. So, this is a close-up of a fruit fly, and you may not like if I tell you that you are like these guys. But think about it for a second, this is very good for us because now we can use these animals as a model system to understand more about sleep biology, and how light influences our clock and our health, and this is what my lab is doing. So, they sleep just like we do, they sleep at night. If we deprive them of sleep, then they crash the next day during the time they would normally be active. If we deprive them of sleep for a long time, they die; so sleep is very important for them. The same genes that regulate sleep in humans regulate sleep in flies. And when they\'re asleep they\'re disconnected, at least to a large degree, disconnected from their environment, just like we are. So, if these guys are sleeping, you need a stronger intensity stimulus to get them to react than when they\'re awake. So same thing that happens to you of course, when you\'re asleep. Two people in my lab: a postdoc, Iris Titos Vivancos and a PhD student, Michelle Frank, are asking exactly what is this barrier that\'s established in the brain that prevents sensor information from coming through during sleep? How can your same physical brain exist in two fundamentally different states? So now we\'re engaged, for instance, here I\'m speaking to you, I\'m engaged, I\'m aware of you, of my surroundings, I\'m aware of my internal state; but tonight when I go to sleep, I will be in a completely different state. And another thing that we\'re asking which is relevant to what I talked about, to light, is how light coming through the eye is regulating sleep and wake patterns? A PhD student in my lab, Bryan Song, is asking exactly this, What Bryan can do is, he can-- you can see that flies have these big eyes that take up a large part of their head. What Bryan can do is he can actually trick the cells in the eye into thinking they\'re seeing light, even when they\'re not. And this results in animals having trouble falling asleep, so it takes them about an hour and a half longer to fall asleep. You can imagine that now we can use this as a model organism to understand what it is that happens in the brain when it\'s getting light information and how this is interfacing with sleep and wake centers in the brain. And so one final thing I want to tell you is well, first I want you to think again for a moment about our evolutionary history. We evolved without alarm clocks, without any external source of information of the time of day, and we\'ve developed this way that keeps us in sync with our environment. But what we\'re exposing ourselves to every day now is very much interfering with that natural system, and I think it\'s really something to think about. So when people tell you that too much light exposure at night is not good, unfortunately, they are actually right. And the last thing I want to say is please support basic science, because this is important for all of us, and this is the way forward, I think. (Applause)'}",

In premodern Italy, owners of failed businesses that had outstanding debts were taken, completely nude, to the public plaza, where they had to hit their backside against a rock while a crowd jeered at them. In 17th-century France, failed business owners were carried to the center of the marketplace, where the beginning of their bankruptcy was announced publicly. To avoid being immediately taken to jail, they had to wear a green beret so everyone knew they were a failure. Of course, these are extreme cases, but it's important to refer to the past to remember that when the laws are too punishing to failed entrepreneurs, it disincentivizes the creation of new businesses and innovation, which are the engines of economic growth of any country."", '01:22': ""Fortunately, time has passed, and now we don't publicly humiliate entrepreneurs who fail. Still, it's not common to see big business figures publish the details of their mistakes on social media. I think everyone here can relate to the pain you feel when a project fails. But that doesn't mean we share the details of those experiences with our friends. And I understand perfectly -- I've been there, too. I had a business that failed horribly. It was a very painful experience and sharing it was very difficult. In fact, sharing it took seven years, a good amount of vulnerability and the company of my friends. This is the story of my failure."", '02:13': 'When I was at college studying business, I met a group of indigenous women who lived in a very marginalized rural community in Puebla, a state in the center of Mexico. They created beautiful handmade crafts. So when I met them and became familiar with their work, I decided that I wanted to do something to help them. And I did everything just like they had taught me at business school back then: I partnered with my friends; we procured funding; we spent a lot of time building the business and training the artisans.', '02:50': ""But we soon realized that we were rookies. The truth is, the crafts didn't sell -- or better yet, we didn't know how to sell them -- and the business plan we had made wasn't realistic. We worked for years without salary, waiting for a miracle to happen, hoping that magically, a huge buyer would appear and make the business profitable and prevent the entire project from dying. But in the end, the miracle didn't happen. We had to close the business and that broke my heart, because I began the whole project in order to have a positive impact on the life of the artisans, and I felt that I had actually had a very negative impact. I felt so guilty about what happened that for years I hid it from my résumé and from my conversations."", '03:49': 'Some time later, I was out with some entrepreneur friends, and the topic of failure came up. I took the risk and confessed to them the story of my failed business that I had kept a secret for so many years. To my surprise, my friends had similar stories. And at that moment, something became very clear in my mind: I hung out with total failures!', '04:16': '(Laughter)', '04:18': ""No, but seriously, that day I realized that we all have hidden failures. Tell me if that's not true."", '04:26': '(Audience responds)', '04:28': 'That night, I realized that sharing your failures publicly makes you stronger, not weaker. Actually, for me, it was like an exorcism. It was like a weight was lifted off of me; I had nothing to hide anymore. That night, I also realized that being open to this new place of my vulnerability helped me connect with others in a much deeper and authentic way. As a result of that experience, of sharing stories of businesses that didn\'t work, we decided to create an event series so that other people could also share their stories of failed businesses. We called it ""FuckUp Nights."" And some time later, we created the Failure Institute --', '05:10': '(Laughter)', '05:11': ""the name is awesome -- the Failure Institute. It's a research center dedicated to the study of failure and its consequences on people, businesses and society. It's been really surprising and gratifying to find that when an entrepreneur gets up on stage to tell the story of their failed business, it's not a cause for humiliation or shame, as it usually was in the past. Actually, it's an opportunity to share lessons and generate empathy. We've also found that when members of the same team get together to share their stories of failure, something magical happens: collaboration becomes easier, and the bonds become stronger."", '05:58': ""In fact, over the course of the events and the research, we've found surprising things. Perhaps among my favorites are the differences between men and women when they're faced with failure. The most common behavior among men after closing their business is to open another business but in a different sector within a year, while among women, it's more common to look for a job and postpone creating a new business for the future. Our hypothesis is that this can be attributed to women's tendency to suffer more from impostor syndrome; that is, we feel like we're lacking in some way in order to be true entrepreneurs. However, I've seen that many times, we have everything necessary, and all that's missing is that we risk taking the first step. And in the case of men, it's more common that they feel they have the necessary knowledge and they just need to apply it in another place where they'd have more luck."", '06:58': ""We've also found that there are interesting regional differences in terms of the way in which entrepreneurs recuperate after the failure of our business. For example, on the European continent, it's much more common that entrepreneurs seek out a therapist to recuperate emotionally. On the other hand, on the American continent, the most common behavior is to seek out education and training."", '07:23': ""Another finding that's really changed my life is the profound impact that public policy has on the way in which entrepreneurs decide to close their business and recuperate from the experience. For example, in my country, Mexico, the regulatory framework for closing a business is so strict that closing a business in compliance with the law can take too much time and too much money. Let's start with the money part. If things go well, if your business isn't involved in big problems, if you don't have any issues with suppliers like outstanding debts, closing a business will cost you US $2,000. which in my country is a considerable amount of money. Someone who earns the minimum salary as of 2018 would have to work 15 months to come up with that money. And with respect to time, on average, closing a business takes two years. As we know, in Mexico and in many other places in the world, the average life expectancy of a business is two years. So what happens when the life expectancy of a business is so similar to the amount of time it will take you to close it if it doesn't work? Of course, this disincentivizes the creation of new businesses and promotes the informal economy. In fact, econometric research has shown that the less time and money needed to close a business, the greater the creation of new business."", '08:59': 'So in 2017, we decided to present a series of public policy recommendations for the law that governs the closing of businesses. For a year, we worked with the Association of Entrepreneurs and with the Mexican congress, and the good news is that we managed to change the law.', '09:17': '(Applause)', '09:25': ""The idea is that once the new legislation goes into effect, entrepreneurs will be able to close their business via an online process, which will be much more accessible to everyone and shorter. The truth is, when I look back and remember that night when my friends and I confessed our failures to each other six years ago, I'm surprised, because at that moment, our intention was very simple: the only thing we wanted to do was put the subject of failure on the table so more friends could see that this was a topic to be talked about. It's not a time for humiliation as in the past, nor is it a cause for celebration, as some people say."", '10:08': 'In fact, I\'ll admit that when I hear students or people from Silicon Valley brag about failing fast or frequently, as if closing a business were no big deal, the truth is, it worries me a lot. And it worries me because I think that behind the mantra of failing fast, or ""fail fast"" as they say in Silicon Valley, there\'s a dark side. On one hand, when we insist to entrepreneurs that failing fast is the only option, it\'s possible that we\'re promoting mediocrity -- that entrepreneurs don\'t give their maximum effort, and that they give up when faced with the most minor difficulty. I also think that when we talk about failing fast, we\'re minimizing that negative impact that closing a business has. Of course, I believe failing fast is a great way to accelerate learning and avoid wasting time. But we can\'t deny the negative consequences that exist behind the death of a business.', '11:06': 'For example, when my social enterprise failed, the worst part was going back to the indigenous community and confessing to the artisans that the project had died, and that I was responsible. For many, this could have been viewed as a learning opportunity. The truth is that the death of this business meant that the artisans would lose income that they desperately needed.', '11:33': 'So today, I\'d like to propose an idea. I\'d like to propose that just as we put aside the idea of publicly humiliating entrepreneurs who fail, we should also put aside the idea that to fail fast is always best. Instead, I want to propose a new mantra: fail with awareness, or ""fail mindfully"" -- experience with full attention the entire process that closing a business involves. Remember that businesses are not entities that magically appear and disappear. Businesses are made up of people. And if a business project fails, surely, some of those people will lose their jobs or lose money. And in the case of social enterprises or green businesses, when they fail, surely the closing of the project will have a negative impact on the communities or ecosystems they were intended to benefit.', '12:30': 'But what do I mean by ""fail mindfully""? For me, it means being aware of the impact that closing a business has, being aware of the lessons learned, and above all, being aware of the great responsibility to share those lessons with the world.', '12:56': 'Thank you.', '12:57': '(Applause)'}",

In many places in this country, we don't have a functioning democracy. People might go to the polls, but they might not have a real choice when they get there. In 2010, the people of Florida were trying to do something about this. They passed a ballot initiative with almost two-thirds of the vote: a new state constitutional amendment requiring that districts be fair and not biased based on race or party. It didn't work. The state legislature sued to try and get out of these new requirements, and in subsequent court battles, the maps they made were found to be racially and partisan biased. Florida is just one example of our national problem with gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is when you take a few people from one place and a few people from another place and draw a line around them on the map to create a district with some specific demographic goal. Here's an example world with 25 people: 60% green people and 40% purple people. If you split that up into five simple districts of five people each, you can preserve that ratio in the outcome and have three districts won by green people and two districts won by purple people. But if you pack enough green people into just two districts, then you can flip that outcome and wind up with three districts where there's a purple majority. Or you can crack the purple people and split them up just right so that they don't have a majority anywhere. These strategies of packing and cracking are being used in dozens of districts throughout the country. That bright blue district in northeast Florida was found to be racially biased because it packs too many black people into one district, diminishing their influence elsewhere. That was Florida in 2012, but gerrymandering has been going on for a long time, since at least 1812, when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law a map that was drawn into a political cartoon as a monstrous, dragonesque salamander, and thus was born the gerrymander. But it's gotten a lot worse lately. The joke is that instead of voters picking their politicians, politicians are picking their voters. Why is this a problem? When you have too many seats that are gerrymandered to be safe for one party or another, the political process breaks down in some ways. I have one personal example. In 2006, I was a webmaster for a congressional campaign in California. We were in a district that was gerrymandered, say, for the other party. And the incumbent in that party didn't feel the need to take part in the campaign and wouldn't agree to show up for any debates. He just felt he didn't have to. And our party wouldn't send any help; they figured we were a lost cause. Come election day, the incumbent got the expected 60/40 result. In other places, it's even worse. In 2014, there were 32 congressional districts that went unopposed - no one else on the ballot. That's over 20 million Americans with no effective choice over who their representative in Congress is. In some places, the incumbent faces a more extreme challenger from within their own party. And whether you have an extremist upstart or a long incumbent safe seat, that politician might not feel the need to reach out across the aisle and compromise on anything because they're safe, and the legislative process grinds to a halt, and voters get more cynical. What if we could have impartial districts? What if we defined what a good district was mathematically and didn't let anyone else's agenda interfere? Florida's map might look something like this. About 10 years ago, computers got powerful enough to solve for this kind of map that follows the legal requirements of having equal population per district, contiguous districts that are each all one piece, and in this case, solving for compact districts that try to tightly represent one location or region. But I didn't know it would work when I started. Previous work in this area had been on tiny toy maps like the one I showed you earlier, and they didn't think it would scale up to a full state worth of data. But I figured I was a pretty good engineer and I'd give it a shot, and I think it worked out pretty well. So, when the 2010 census data starting coming out, I set my home computer to work, and over the next six months, it came up with 137 maps for state legislature and congressional districts all over the country. And I think the results are pretty good. Let's see another one. First, the old way. North Carolina has also been in almost constant legal battles since their maps came out a little over four years ago. Most recently, they were thrown out for racial bias just as primary season was spinning up. New maps were hastily drawn up, and the primary had to be pushed back from March until June. Voters and candidates were left in disarray. That red district in the northeast reaches into and around three other districts. That pink district in the middle pinches down as narrow as possible while reaching out to grab other areas. This is nuts. These are the visual telltales of districts that have been distorted toward some political end. The opposite of a sprawling, non-local gerrymandered map is a compact map, like this. I hope you can see the difference. You can also measure it. I measure compactness as the average distance per person to the center of their district. In the old North Carolina map, that distance was 38 miles; in my map, it's 25 miles. You can measure how sprawling and non-local a gerrymandered map is and how compact a compact map is. So, it's technically possible. How's the political situation? You might expect that there would be some resistance to this kind of change, and there is, but there is also some demand for it. The republican governor of Maryland has recently called out for national help in overturning his state's democratic gerrymander. That is one of the more contorted messes of tentacled horrors of districts I have seen in any map. (Laughter) I don't know if this is the best map, but I submit that it is a legally viable map, without some of the obvious runaround and drawbacks of the old map. There are a lot of states with divided government, with the two parties fighting over redistricting. But this shouldn't be something to fight about. Redistricting should be a bureaucratic, boring process, where you get in new census data, you turn the crank, and you get out new maps for the next 10 years. In the last few years, California, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida have passed reform of one kind or another. That shows that it's possible. Those reforms might not be perfect, and they might still need some tinkering, but we can do it. This is technically possible. Open-source software, free and verifiable, running on home computers that anyone can use can solve for these kinds of impartial maps, and the results are pretty good. This is politically possible. People want reform - even some elected officials want it. And the legal mechanisms are achievable. If we could have a change now, we could have a big effect on the future of our political process. If reform comes to enough places, enough states, we might even be able to get a national standard. And a national standard might let us really hold up our core value of equal protection under the law for all. (Applause)""}",

So ... Why do we vote on Tuesday? Does anybody know? And as a matter of fact, Michigan and Arizona are voting today. Here\'s the answer: Absolutely no good reason whatsoever. (Laughter) I\'m not joking. You will not find the answer in the Declaration of Independence, nor will you find it in the Constitution. It is just a stupid law from 1845.

It took a day to get to the county seat to vote, a day to get back, and you couldn\'t travel on the Sabbath, so, Tuesday it was. I don\'t often travel by horse and buggy, I would imagine most of you don\'t, so when I found out about this, I was fascinated.

Now the population is over seven billion, which is due to a change in our way of life from over 10,000 years ago. Some of your and my ancestors saw the potential in certain wild plants and animals and started domesticating them. This happened through continuous cultivation and selection of those plants with a special capacity - only a small part of wild plants and animals can be domesticated at all. Let's have a look at this plant, for example. Isn't it amazing that out of this wild cabbage, kale, cauliflower and all the other cabbage varieties were developed? This development into a culture plant did, of course, not happen overnight but took thousands of years, and it took several hundreds of generations of humans. That's why they are a real cultural heritage, just like the Eiffel Tower or a Van Gogh painting. So, maybe the next time you bite into a cauliflower, be aware that you're eating a kind of Mona Lisa. (Laughter) Through domestication process, a huge diversity arose. For almost every part of the world, species and varieties that fit the special conditions were found. In Switzerland, for example, there were distinct varieties in almost every village, like the Küttiger carrot or the Uster apple. I like to watch the reactions of people at exhibitions of traditional varieties. It is clearly split by age. Older the people say, 'Oh, I remember this variety from my grandmother's garden.' And younger people, they are just amazed and say, 'I didn't know there were so many different ones', and then they take out their phone and take a picture. (Laughter) But apart from being a cultural heritage or simply being beautiful, do we really need this much diversity? Would not one single variety of each crop be enough? What happens if a population depends too much on a single variety was highlighted in Ireland in the mid 19th century. The Irish were mostly cultivating a potato variety called the Lumper. Potatoes of the same variety are clones and thus genetically identical. So when a new disease arrived with the potato blight, it had a very easy game, and it destroyed the crops in consecutive years. The sad consequence was that about a million people died, and one and a half million Irish had to emigrate. We can see from this that nature does not agree with monocultures, as they can be easily wiped out by a single disease. The natives in South America, for example, do not grow only one single potato variety but many, many different ones. Like this, they always have a yield, as the varieties differ in their reaction to pests and drier or wetter years. A more current example to show that monocultures are only short living is the banana. It may well be that in a few years, you will not be able to eat one anymore. The trade relies to 95 percent on a single variety which is grown on large plantations. These are now threatened by the Panama disease. There is no other variety to replace it at the moment. And to make my point for diversity very clear, let's look at it from a completely different angle. If you were so lucky to be a millionaire, you would not put all your money on the same stock, but you would diversify because the risk of losing everything is too big. But, in agriculture, instead of diversifying and minimising the risk, what we are doing is the exact opposite. And this funnel represents the concentration which is taking place at every level. Firstly, it represents the people working in agriculture. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was 60 percent of the population. Now, it is down to three percent. And it stands for the seed companies. In 1970, there were 7,000 companies, and none had a market share of over 0.5%. Now, the top five hold 60 percent of the market. And it stands for the huge loss in diversity. In the last 150 years, we lost 75 percent of all varieties ever selected by humans. They have gone forever. One reason for this huge loss is the industrialisation of every culture and with it the appearance of modern hybrid seeds. For farmers and gardeners, hybrid seeds are a dead end because they do not stay true to type when you take the seeds. You have to buy them every year, and thus, they are an extremely good business model, as you have to rely on the companies. Traditional varieties, on the other hand, can be regrown by everybody who wants to, year after year, by saving your own seeds. With traditional varieties, many ways are possible, and this is what makes them powerful. They can be the base for a more sustainable agricultural future. We do not know what challenges lie ahead and what new traits will be necessary, but the more diversity we can safeguard now, the better the chances are that we will have the suitable varieties at hand for the future. And that is why I would like this funnel to be reversed again. With urban gardening and farming and community supported agriculture, reversing this process has already started. And that is why we from the ProSpecieRara Foundation try to save as many different traditional varieties as possible. At the moment we're safeguarding 1,600 different vegetable varieties in our seed library here in Basel, and the number is still growing. We think it's important to sow the seeds every year so that they can adapt to changing environment. We would need a very large garden to be able to do so, but fortunately, we have the help of over 500 volunteers who grow the varieties in their own garden and then send the saved seeds back to us. Without them, our work and that of other seed saving organisations would not be possible. You can also be part in reversing this process. To be honest, seed saving is quite difficult with most crops, but some are rather easy. Tomatoes, for example, are very simple and very rewarding. Have you ever eaten a sun-ripe tomato fresh from the plant? The taste of it excels that of the supermarket type by far. And instead of eating only red and round ones, you can choose from a huge variety in color, shape and size. I'm sure you would find one that suits you. All you need is a sunny spot on your balcony or in front of your house, a pot, earth and water. When a tomato is ripe, the seeds are ripe as well. So if you want to get the seeds from a very good variety, you just put the seeds in a glass and let them sit for one or two days. Then you rinse them and let them dry. As nature is abundant, you will get a large amount of seeds, which you can share with your friends and family and resow next spring. By sowing and sharing them, you will keep a link alive to what your and my ancestors have been doing for thousands of years, and bring it into the future. I hope you will give it a try. Thank you.

What we found is that everyone has a set of tensions in their work and life, things like making a living and making a life, or fulfilling the organization's needs and the needs of the individual. We navigate those tensions using our own unique strategies, for example, working remotely, learning new skills, or self care. Navigating these tensions is critical, because a lot is at stake for us when we show up to work, like our sense of purpose or our connection to our families and communities.

To which I reply, ""I work to end violence against children. All violence against every child in every country."" There\'s usually a pause. Sometimes, depending on the setting, ""Whoa, that\'s a conversation killer."" And then the questions: ""What sort of violence are you talking about?"" ""How much violence is there?"" ""Where is it happening, is it happening here?"" And when I answer those questions, people tend to be shocked. Shocked at the scale of violence, shocked at the nature of violence. But I\'m always quick to make sure that people aren\'t left with a sense of doom and gloom.', '00:45': ""I believe we have an unprecedented historical opportunity in this generation to end violence against children. There's a nascent movement building around this. Governments, national governments, city governments, provinces and others are joining that movement. And when we succeed -- and it will take all of us -- we will change the course of human history."", '01:08': 'What do I mean by violence against children? I mean all of the physical violence, sexual, psychological and emotional violence that happens to children at home, at school, online and in their communities. We work with partners right across the world and from those partners, we hear disturbing stories of individual children.', '01:29': ""For example, Sarah, age 10. Raped repeatedly by her stepfather and threatened with violence if she tells anyone. Faisal, hit across the knuckles at school with a cable, shamed and called a donkey, made to stand outside in the cold when he gets the answers wrong. And from the partners we work with to make the internet safer for children, we hear stories like that of Angelika. Twelve years old, and forced to commit sexual acts on her uncle, which are live-streamed to paying adults the other side of the world. One in 10 girls experiences sexual abuse before the age of 20. Half of children live in countries where corporal punishment has not been fully prohibited. And last year alone, in the US, 45 million reports were made of images and videos of violent and sexual abuse of children online. Twice the number the year before. Now these forms of violence and other forms of violence roll up into some truly staggering numbers. One billion children globally every year who experience some kind of violence. That's one in two children. This is a universal issue."", '02:43': 'So what gives me optimism? Let me talk about Sweden and Uganda. Probably about as different as two countries you might imagine. If you speak to an economist, they might tell you that Sweden has a per capita average income of around 50,000 dollars a year. In Uganda, it\'s 2,000 dollars. A historian might tell you Sweden hasn\'t been in a national conflict for about 200 years. Uganda is still struggling with an insurgency in the north of the country. A musician might tell you that Uganda, the national anthem, ""Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty,"" is one of the shortest in the world. In fact, so short, it\'s often played more than once. I believe Swedes play theirs and sing theirs for a little longer.', '03:25': 'But more seriously, Sweden and Uganda have made a commitment, they have a common bond and shared purpose, a commitment to end violence against children, and they are taking action to try and get their countries on a pathway to zero violence against children by 2030. And many other countries, cities and states are joining them, all over the world.', '03:47': ""But what does it really mean, what does it mean in practice? When they make that commitment, what do they do? It means high-level political commitment and leadership. Enacting and implementing legislation. And launching initiatives, changing policy, starting a national conversation that begins to raise awareness on a journey to changing attitudes and making it socially unacceptable to have any violence and abuse of children in a country. It means recognizing that violence against children cuts across many sectors, and therefore the response, the answer, has to be a systems approach. You can't just do one piece of it. It requires multiple agencies within and beyond government. It requires faith groups, the private sector, media, academia, civil society organizations and others. And it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us, but using national-level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country. And using that data to inform the national response, but also using it to measure and track progress. And share what's working, being honest about when things aren't working. And sharing inspiration when we see success and violence declining."", '04:59': ""But can we really do this on a global scale? One billion children a year experiencing violence. I think we can. In 2015, 193 world leaders committed their countries to end violence, abuse and neglect of children by 2030. Violence against children undermines all the other investments in them: in their health, in their education. Often with multi-year, sometimes lifelong and intergenerational consequences and transmission. But it's not just about international agreements and governments. They really matter. I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated. Think of the #MeToo movement, and how sector after sector, industry after industry, calling out perpetrators, bringing and holding them to account. It's a journey, but we've embarked upon it. Look at what's happened in the aid industry. Following some abuses of power, the aid industry is now taking very seriously the safeguarding of children across the world."", '06:03': ""But maybe even more than that. Children and young people themselves, part aided by technology, but they have a voice now that they may not, I don't think, have had before. And they are using that voice, not just to advocate for the situation they see around them or what they know needs to improve, but to be part of the solutions of things that actually inform and affect their lives. Think of those young activists who speak out against female genital mutilation, child marriage, cyber bullying, safe schools, harming conflict -- the list goes on and on. Those children really matter."", '06:40': ""So we have political leadership, we have youth activism, we have evidence-based solutions, we have public awareness growing -- we're on that pathway, beginning that journey to get to zero by 2030. But what are those solutions?"", '06:56': ""Three years ago, in 2016, 10 global institutions came together and aligned behind a framework which is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to ending violence against children. It's called INSPIRE. It looks at the need for the relevant legislation, addressing social norms, parent and caregiver support, responses for children who have experienced violence and abuse. And safe schools, so children can be in a learning environment where they thrive."", '07:26': ""In Uganda, four years ago, an eight-year-old girl could be married to a 30-year-old man. That can no longer happen. In 2016, the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18. That's the I of INSPIRE: enact and implement legislation."", '07:43': ""Cambodia is rolling out parental support, parent and caregiver support across the country, so parents are equipped to raise their children and to have discipline in a nonviolent way in the home. That's the P of INSPIRE, parent and caregiver support."", '07:59': ""In the Philippines, there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide. Women and children who are either at high risk of abuse and violence or have experienced violence. That's the R of INSPIRE, response and support services."", '08:13': ""And in Uganda, a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda, equipping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline. That's the E of INSPIRE, education and life skills."", '08:27': ""That's just some bits within some of the INSPIRE framework. But more and more countries are committing to implement it, adapt it locally, inform it with the relevant data, put a plan together, work across sectors, and begin that journey to zero. Canada, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania -- I mentioned Sweden and Uganda already -- Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, more and more countries, and now cities, too. And right here in Scotland, University of Edinburgh is establishing a learning lab that's going to track the journey that cities in Scotland and the Philippines and Colombia go on together. See what works in a city, take something that's being prepared for implementation at a nationwide level and bring it down to the city level, where we believe that we can actually make probably faster and demonstrable progress in a shorter space of time. And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University."", '09:27': ""Ending violence is the right thing to do, it's a smart investment to make, we have evidence-based solutions, and we have the beginnings of a journey."", '09:36': ""But what would happen if we actually end violence against children? Let's just imagine for a moment. First of all, think of the children I mentioned. Sarah would no longer lie in her bed at night, fearful of the sound of her stepfather's footsteps coming up the stairs. Faisal would go to school and he would thrive. He would no longer fear being at school and being bullied and hit and ashamed by the teachers. And Angelika and those like her would no longer be something, a commodity brought online for the enjoyment of adults thousands of miles away."", '10:12': ""But then multiply the social, the economic, the cultural benefits of that. Multiply those by every family, every community, village, town, city, country and suddenly, you've got a new normal emerging. A generation would grow up without having experienced violence."", '10:30': 'It will take us all. But we do have an unprecedented opportunity to try, and I believe we also, as adults, have a responsibility to do this.', '10:40': 'And then when we\'re all asked, ""What do you do?"" each and every one of us can say, ""I\'m changing the course of human history. I\'m doing my bit to end violence against children."" Let\'s do this and do it now.', '10:56': 'Thank you.', '10:57': '(Applause)'}",

And it's from that period, circa 1735, that we find these bone buttons. These were made by poor persons in the almshouse. Poor persons in the almshouse were assigned various tasks to earn their keep, among them, shredding old rope for reuse, dressing hemp, picking oakum, making bone buttons, in the thought that hard work would reform these poor persons into productive members of society. The almshouse served several groups: poor needy persons, sturdy beggars, idle wandering vagabonds. And reasons to be admitted? Insanity, pregnancy, or being a widow or an orphan who could no longer pay their way.  Which makes this piece all the more interesting. This child's plate was found within the walls of the Bridewell. The Bridewell was one of the most feared and notorious prisons of its time, and it happened to have been right next door to the almshouse. In fact, there were prisons on either side of the almshouse, and at times, these institutions were so overcrowded. Prisoners and poor persons were sharing the same spaces. And while there is a lot of clamor about how can you expose children to hardened criminals, let's not forget that children as young as twelve were convicted to the Bridewell for stealing bread. What all this gives us is an insight into life in the 18th century, what it was like to be poor in the 18th century, perhaps being segregated from a portion of society, perhaps being assigned tasks to earn their keep. It was a time when three-fifths of New York City's population were living at or near the subsistence level, if not below. And 10% of the population owned more than half of the city's wealth. The past has a lot to teach us about our present and our future. I'm a firm believer that in order to have a sustainable future, we must have a well-understood past. Archaeology affords us New Yorkers and pretty much anyone in an urban center the opportunity to incorporate the knowledge of our past into our present-day dialogues, into the dialogues about our futures, incorporate the information into our shared spaces, and hopefully, it can bring all of our diverse communities within New York City, again, within any city closer together. And if I can get just one person to think a little bit differently about what they see when they walk down the city streets, or through an urban park, then I've done my job of sharing the past.

Anybody in the audience who doesn\'t have a plastic ID? Anybody? Well, think about it. Plastic is everywhere. The buttons on your shirt, your mobile cover, the water from the plastic bottle you just had, plastic money in the wallet, maybe. It is interesting how plastic has become an integral part of our lives and how we cannot go one single day without it. Do you know what that makes me think? How my generation is inheriting not just this legacy but also the problem that comes with it: the problem of what we throw in our oceans. Hello, everybody. My name is Haaziq Kazi. I am 12 years old, and I alone have a plastic debt of roughly 66 tons and counting. So, in case you are wondering, What is plastic debt? It is the amount of non-cycled plastic which we humans leave behind on this planet. How many Indians in the house today? Raise your hands, please. According to a study, for every person in India, six tons of plastic is not recycled annually. Any Americans here? Your figures are even more astounding. Ninety tons per person of plastic which is not recycled, annually. Imagine, in a lifetime, how much plastic is left behind because of us. When we die, our bodies go back to Mother Earth, but the plastic debt is left behind as a legacy for the coming generations. Did you know that by 2050, we will have as much, or maybe more, plastic in the ocean than fish? Speaking of which, every time I see people eating fish, I wonder, ""Are they eating fish or plastic?"" Because the plastic we dispose that ends up in the ocean might have been consumed by the same fish which gets on our plate - talk about the vicious karmic cycle. The magnitude of the problem inspired me to do something about this. Hence, I came up with an idea of an invention that could help make the oceans a cleaner place: an ocean cleaner called ERVIS. ERVIS is an intelligent ship which sucks waste from the ocean surface and cleans it. It all started two years back. I saw some documentaries and a TED Talk of Boyan Slat about how he wanted to clean the oceans. A few days later, as I came home from playing football, my mom asked me to wash my hands, and as I went to the sink to get the dirt off, I observed a whirlpool of water going down the drain. An idea came to my mind, and I smiled. I drew and created a rough model, a circular ship with saucers attached, a very futuristic design, much like the USS Enterprise from Star Trek. Come on, we all love the series. Right? This was just the first draft. The propellers weren\'t automated, and it only lasted seven seconds in water before coming apart. But there it was: my ERVIS, my vision of changing the oceans. While guzzling down innumerable cups of hot chocolate - you know, I\'m still a kid, no coffee for me - I did some exhaustive research to achieve my vision of ERVIS, which is: first, to clean the current waste floating in the ocean; second, to analyze the data from the waste which we collect; and third, to stop it at source, which is getting disposed by the ships. I also realized that a circular shape was not very efficient and that I had to redesign my ship to be more hydrodynamic. So I worked with scientists and engineers to create a more bleeding edge model. So here\'s how it works. The ship is essentially a large boat powered by solar and renewable natural gas, with various compartments, and saucers surrounding it. The saucers float on the surface, gravitate to create a whirlpool to pull the waste towards its center, which is then sent through a tube to various chambers in the ship. The chambers include an oil chamber, which collects waste oil. The next four chambers are for large, medium, small, and micro-waste, respectively. Just imagine ERVIS to be a gigantic vacuum cleaner with many cleaning tubes attached to many dust bags. Once the waste enters the chambers, ERVIS analyzes, segregates, and compacts it, and pumps the filtered water back into the oceans, all without harming marine life in the process. ERVIS, the ship, is my contribution in making the Earth a better place. (Applause) And I hope, in some way, it can inspire you to find your idea which can bring a positive change in the world. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)'}",

(Laughter) (Cheers) (Applause) Too much sugar just makes you fat. (Laughter) Journalists, keep going and stay humble. We may know a little about a lot, but few of us know enough about anything to have an opinion that matters. So we dig for the facts that do matter, from all sides, and then fight like hell to tell them. And potential future journalists, your country needs you. Journalism is war, a fight every day for truth. And it takes more than being curious and knowing how to write or blog or shoot a video or ask questions. It takes courage, and most of all, it takes integrity. Because journalism is only as good as the people who practice it and their willingness to stand up and fight for the stories that mean something. You will make mistakes; we all do. But with practice and instincts you may not know you have, you will learn to make less of them. You will face a lack of resources, you will be denied access, people will refuse to give you interviews, editors and executive producers will give you impossible deadlines and not enough time or space to tell your stories. This is emotionally hard and sometimes around-the-clock work. It might cause people to hate you. It might put you in danger or expose you to trauma that might give you PTSD. This I know from experience. But after nearly 40 years at this, I still stand here before you and can honestly say with all my heart: journalism is a noble calling, a way to serve people and respond like an EMT or an emergency room doctor in a crisis with information they may need. If you work for the people and not for those who pay your checks, you will make the right choices about who to interview, what to ask and how to tell your stories, and this will bring your news organizations value that will make even your bosses happy. Be incorruptible. Do it with a pure motive, earnestly, without bias and expectations. Do it even though you may never know the impact of your stories. Do it even if you know you will be criticized. But get it right, which you will find is far more important than getting it first. Attribute, (Applause) attribute whenever possible. Check, check, and then double check the facts. Ruthlessly edit out any word or phrase or tone in your work that could get in the way of people making up their own minds. This is how we build trust, by working to be worthy of it. It is time to lift truth off its knees, prize it, cherish it, defend it and watch it rise along with all of us. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)""}",

So, I\'m going to talk today about migration and movement, and particularly people moving into the British Isles in the past. And if we think about past migrations into Britain, we probably first off might have some ideas about the 20th century, people coming from the Caribbean, from east Africa, or from India, or Pakistan, or places like that. And if we have to go back a bit further in time, of course we\'ve got people like the Normans, Romans or the Vikings. But despite the fact that we\'ve noticed quite a lot of people who have moved into Britain at different times, I don\'t think we really think of ourselves as a migrant nation. We think of ourselves more outside as an island nation. But what about if we go back really a long way, we really go back far in time beyond the time when there is any notion of a Britain or an England, beyond any kind of english language, in fact beyond written history at all. In fact, we can go so far back in time that Britain is actually not even an island at all. It\'s still joined to the continent, still part of the Eurasian landmass. So that\'s what I want to talk to you about today, about Britain in prehistory, and the prehistory of migration here. So we\'re going to take a big jump back in time, but I can\'t do that with you all in one go. So we are going to take little jumps first. We are going to jump back to the late Victorian period, and we\'re going to start off here. Here, we start in Somerset at Cheddar Gorge. It is here during the last decades of the 19th century, that this guy, Richard Cox Gough, discovered and excavated and blasted out a series of caves that he made into a major tourist attraction or a showcase. But it\'s actually a year after Richard died that the really big discovery was made, the one we\'re actually interested in. So that discovery was made in December, 1903, and it was made by Richard\'s son, Arthur, who was digging a drainage ditch to try to combat the seasonal flooding that they had in the caves. They tended to make all their big discoveries in the winter because that\'s when there weren\'t any tourists around. So workmen who were working on the cave actually blasted out and uncovered  the skeleton of an adult male. And rather quickly, this skeleton made big news. Experts of the day said that perhaps it was the body of the first Englishman, and that he was of extreme importance, that he was at least 40,000 years old and perhaps as much as 80,000 years old. Well, that\'s not entirely true. What we actually know today is that ""Cheddar Man,"" as he became known, Is actually about 10,000 years old, but he is still certainly very important. He\'s extremely important for a number of reasons. Firstly because he is the only near-complete skeleton that we have from that kind of time period. He is also important because he\'s the only one where we have a complete skull or near-complete skull. And here is the skull, in this rather post-setting with the two brothers, William and Arthur, staring at it. They seem to be enjoying themselves which is what I really like about this picture. (Laughter) So what else do we know about Cheddar Man? Well, he\'s definitely a man. And that has been the subject of a little bit debate over the years because he has a rather gracile and slender skeleton. He was probably in his early twenties when he died; he was buried deliberately, it seems, and he was buried on his own. Today, he looks something like this. This guy has been better assembled, and you can see him at the Natural History Museum. He is on display a couple of galleries away from where my office is. So, we\'ve worked on Cheddar Man and a number of other individuals over the years and built together quite a large complex project exploring the history of the British Isles. And one of the things that came up as the result of that project was the opportunity to take part in a channel 4 documentary where we were going to explore Cheddar Man and his history to build up more of a story about him. So that was good because we already had quite a lengthy project working on the history of the British Isles, but what the people who put the documentary together wanted to know about was something a little bit more complicated, more detailed, and that was about his appearance, about his skin color, hair color and eye color. And what we were able to do for them was to supply that information. We passed it on to the people who made the reconstruction. Well, they came back with this, an individual with a rather small face compared to the overall size of his head, with blue eyes, dark curly hair,  and obviously with dark skin. And that was a surprise for some people, for most of the people I talked to actually. And most of them actually seem to think that this was rather cool. People who saw the show generally quite enjoyed it. We weren\'t particularly surprised by this because similar information had already been generated by a group, a couple of year previously, looking at different skeletons around Europe of a similar kind of age. They had already identified that dark skin was practically normal for people about 10,000 years ago. But what we\'ve been able to do  was better quantify exactly how dark that was. And we\'ve done that using a tool borrowed from forensic sciences. Some people didn\'t think that this was very cool. Some people I think were expecting to see something a little bit more like this, which is the results of the previous reconstruction. Both reconstructions are obviously quite different, but they do share one feature at least which is this rather wispy facial hair. And I\'m surprised about that because there\'s really no evidences either way, from the archeological genetic data, that would tend to actually suggest that. But that is perhaps their only shared feature actually. So those people, who didn\'t think it was very cool, were a bit surprised, and they made their surprise known on social media, as you might expect. And actually things got rather heated there, and you can look at that. Right now I don\'t really want to go into too much detail about it. But here\'s one of the sort of slightly odd events that happened there, one of my childhood heroes indirectly ... (Laughter) ... indirectly congratulating me on having upset some people. So that was a little bit weird actually. And that went on for a while. So, what became clear to us was something rather disappointing. As I\'ve already said to you, we had spent quite a bit of time getting a pretty good understanding of what the population history of British Isles actually looks like. So how do you get from someone like this to people in the audience today? I mean Cheddar Man obviously not Billy Bragg! So that\'s what I\'m going to go through now, what we\'re going to have a look at. Okay, but before we can do that we have to work out how exactly we\'re going to look at that information. We really have a lot of data here. The human genome has 3.2 billion base pairs and I can\'t just keep flashing that up because we\'d run out of time quite quickly. So what we need to do is find a way of crunching those data down and just pulling out the most important and interesting parts of it. And the method that we often use just to get a handle on the data initially is called the ""principal components analysis,"" and that\'s what I\'m going to show you here. So these are genome data that has been squashed down onto something that looks a bit like a graph or a plot. And so individuals who are close together are genetically similar to each other, regardless of where they might happen to come from. So let\'s start here with Cheddar Man. But all alone, like he was in Gough\'s cave, he\'s not actually doing much for us, he\'s not telling us very much. So let\'s put on the other five individuals from Britain, from which we have very small amounts of genome sequenced data, and see what happens. What happens then is that they all plot together quite neatly. Despite the fact that we have individuals here from Scotland, Wales and southwest England, they actually all look quite similar to each other. Let\'s expand the search a bit more across the rest of Europe. What we have here are some more individuals. The ones in blue are older individuals, slightly older ones from slightly earlier time periods. The ones in that kind of dark red color are of a similar age. And these are samples that have been taken from Spain, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg, all sorts of places including Britain. And what you see is that the British ones  kind of bridge the gap between the earlier and later ones. But there\'s still not much of a picture here. Where we do get a bit of a surprise is if we jump forward in time a bit more. Okay, so what we have here,  about 4000 years after Cheddar Man died, is that something quite surprising happened in Britain, and that\'s the origins of farming. So the first farmers had arrived in Europe several thousands years earlier. They had arrived in Greece. They are the red folks on that plot. They\'d made they way across Europe over several millennia and eventually arrived in Britain where we have the grey individuals on the plot. What you can see there about those grey people is that we have two important things to get out of this. They are genetically extremely different to the hunter-gatherers that were in Britain at that time. And they entirely replaced them, a complete replacement of the population. Now it\'s always tempting at these points to think of some kind of vast horde arriving and committing some kind of genocidal act on the people, the peaceful hunter-gatherer people. We don\'t have any evidence for that at all. So what we think in fact is quite plausible is that there were actually remarkably few people in the British Isles at this time. [Farmers] arrive and just take over. And they can easily take over the country. What is even more surprising  is that a very similar thing happens about 1300 years later. A second genetically very distinct group arrives in the British Isles. These are the so-called ""Beaker people"" who are called that because of the distinctive ceramic vessels that they\'re often buried with. These Beaker people were also genetically very different and seem to completely replace the Neolithic people there, the farmers that were there before. And this, it seems, is the last major population replacement that we can detect at the resolution that we can work with at the moment, with ancient DNA data. So if we bring up now the modern population across Europe, you can see that those Beaker people sit pretty much on top of current British Isles populations and, in fact, the populations of northwestern Europe continents in a bit of smear across there as well. Okay, so what can we draw from this? What do we really have to conclude here? One of the things that I realized  some time after we\'ve done this work and the documentary show was that for some people who are upset by the way we had reconstructed Cheddar Man, the issue was one of population continuity. We had challenged that notion that they had that there was a long-term population continuity in Britain. And that\'s very much not what the data seem to be saying. The history and the prehistory of Britain is one where populations are under a series of replacements. The other thing that you can also draw from this data is about migration and our modern day concerns about mass migration and how it affects society. What you can see here is that the scale of migration today, despite the advent of globalization and mass transportation, is nothing like the kind of migrations that we must have had in the past that have led to these very large-scale replacements. Thanks very much. (Applause)'}",

On the horizon, a shimmering vision under the blazing sun. This is not a cloud, or anything you've ever seen before. It's an enormous ship followed by dozens and dozens more. Strange men come towards you in their white robes carrying with them knowledge and treasures from a distant land. This unimaginable assemblage was led by Admiral Zheng He who established the first-ever sea route connecting the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. The influence of this voyage was so profound that it changed the local cultures wherever it landed. With navigation skills, shipbuilding techniques, Chinese etiquette and social practices on display. Even today, the impact of Admiral Zheng's armada can be traced from Africa all the way back to Asia. I'm here to tell you that another invasion is happening 600 years later and this one will impact you. This one is also led by Chinese, but this time, it's Chinese millennials. (Laughter) I know a ton has been written and said about American millennials - it's all you guys talk about! You're trying to study them, label them, define them, and most importantly, you're trying to cater to them. (Laughter) I'd like to suggest that you might be looking at the wrong group of millennials on the wrong continent. Because whether you're ready or not, we Chinese millennials are about to take over the world! (Laughter) But luckily, I'm here to help you. (Laughter) Here are five things you must know for surviving the impending Chinese millennial invasion. (Laughter) Number one: We are many! (Laughter) Do you know how many American millennials you have today? 90 million. That's a lot. Now, imagine that times five. That's how many of us there are. With a population of around 400 million, we Chinese millennials are proud to be the third biggest country in the world. Most of the talk about American millennials is related to the workplace. With almost five times the amount of American millennials, Chinese millennials are an enormous labor pool. And we're being completely overlooked in the U.S. Who would you rather hire? A new employee who is the best out of 100 people? Or a new employee who is the best out of 500? And since there are so many of us, you'll be seeing more of us in places you never thought of. Don't believe me? This guy seems pretty popular here. (Laughter) He might look old; he's actually one of us millennials. 20 years ago, who would have imagined that a seven foot-plus tall Chinese athlete would become the only non-American player to lead the NBA in all-star voting. Number two: We're well educated and super motivated. Because of the high population density and limited resources, labor is easily replaceable in China. We are required to work harder and be more motivated just to compete with our peers. We're surely not all of the labor pool in China. I contacted Dx Consulting. Today, 57 percent of Chinese millennials have a bachelor's degree; 23 percent of us have a master's degree; and 20 percent have an associate's degree. And of course, we're not just educated in China. In the U.S. in 2014 and '15, 42 percent of Chinese students were studying STEM - science, technology, engineering, mathematics - versus 12 percent for American students. 27 percent of us were studying business and management versus 16 for all students studying in the U.S. We are choosing majors that can give us a competitive edge, and in turn, higher exposure and impact in Western society. Are you having a hard time motivating your American millennial employees? (Laughter) Well, Chinese millennials don't need you to spend a dime on a Foosball table or an in-house coffee shop. (Laughter) (Applause) We are already super motivated and qualified. (Laughter) And we're more than happy to take on the tough jobs. In fact, we've been preparing for it. Number three: We are the Bruce Lee in Levi's with a smartphone who shop online every day. Chinese millennials are multicultural. I even used chopsticks to eat Georgian barbecue when I was interning here in Atlanta. And I was more devastated at this guy's death than my best scores on my Chinese exam. We are really digital. In 2017, smartphone penetration rates is almost 100 percent for those of us who are ages 18 to 34. We are also shaping mobile payment as well as the economy. According to a 2017 survey from Labbrand, 86 percent of Chinese millennials use mobile payment in physical shops at least once a week, versus 45 percent for American millennials. And according to Dx Consulting, we spend four times what American millennials spend for mobile purchases. The U.S. is the center of the digital universe. But for how much longer? If you want to buy the best digital real estate in the virtual world of the future, I suggest that China is a prime location. The good news for foreign companies hoping to capture part of the Chinese millennial market is that my cohort is extremely mobile and adventurous. Here's my personal travel map for the last couple of years. The desire to see the world dominates our consumption habits. We aren't just spending money at home, we are also making purchases and using web services from foreign companies like Airbnb and Uber when we travel overseas. Sure, you buy things from us, and we buy things from you. (Laughter) So next time you have a meeting on how to exploit millennial markets, keep in mind that Chinese millennials - not American - are the biggest emerging consumer demographic on the planet. Number four: We're big picture people. Do you know how big China is? It's around the same size as the States. But we all know that there are four time zones across the contiguous United States. In China, we've got one. In China, everything is perceived as one. One time zone, one official language, one party, despite diverse ethnicities and cultures. Our thinking always starts from the overview to the specific. The Chinese way of writing an address is country, city, and street. And we write the date: year, month, and day. And because we are such big picture people, we focus much more on growth and the future than Americans in the workplace. We tend to look at a company as a whole and see how we fit into it. And number five: We're still Confucian individualists. Granted, we Chinese millennials are acting more and more individual nowadays, but ten years of iPhone and online dating apps cannot wipe out thousands of years of Confucian cultures. A sense of hierarchy is still deeply entrenched in our understanding and construction of social relations. In my mind, a child is supposed to show respect to his parents just like if I'm a subordinate. I'm expected to show respect to a senior manager. I don't think we should disagree with our bosses or criticize them, at least not directly or publicly. (Laughter) (Laughter) My American friends are more likely to challenge authority and power, and I think that's a good thing. We might learn a little bit from American millennials on that, but I do like our respect for hierarchy and experience, and I don't want to see that go away. In 20 years, we'll all still be millennials, but we'll be 40, we'll be in bigger positions of power, and we'll have much more opportunity to change the world like we insist we know how to do right now. And I really hope we do. Everybody knows the Great Wall of China. Even those ancient walls were crossed by Admiral Zheng He 600 years ago, and our new border, if we even had one, is far beyond the old one. Whether you're trying to build your own walls, keep out what you don't want, keep in what you do, hold in your pride, keep out competition, all those things are going to happen anyway. The world is flat. It's flat! But it's tilted toward China now. (Laughter) And I can assure you, we Chinese millennials are ready to be the explorers in this new adventure from the Far East. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)""}",

Now, this actually presents a severe problem, because when we study biological history, we very quickly see that any time there\'s a dominant species in a finite ecosystem, consuming a limited amount of resources, that species will collapse. Now, that collapse usually begins at 50%. When a species has converted 50% of its environment, the ecosystem becomes unstable, and it changes. It’s no longer suitable for that particular species. Now, here’s the scary part. There are 7 billion people on this planet. We are the dominant species. And we’ve converted 43% of the available land mass on Earth. By the year 2050, there will be 9 billion people on our planet and we will be well past 50%. That means most of the people sitting in this auditorium will see this begin. We don’t know exactly what it\'s going to look like, we don\'t know exactly what the impact is going to be, but the worst case scenario is the end of the human race. Because Earth is no longer suitable for human life. Now, the reason that this problem exists is because it’s in our nature. Human beings consume resources. They alter their environment so they can reproduce. It’s the very definition of biological life. The problem is we’re running out of room, we\'re running out of resources and now we\'re running out of time. So we need a plan. What if - what if there was a way that we could make our ecosystem bigger? If we expand our view and we look out into space, we see that all the resources we hold of value here at home - energy, fuels, metals, water - are available in nearly infinite quantities in our solar system. What if there’s a way we could use those resources to prevent the collapse of our civilization? Now, I know, that sounds impossible. It sounds like science fiction. But I have a different viewpoint than you do. I work with some of the smartest people in the world: engineers who have consistently landed robots on other planets; a lot of scientists, rocket scientists, data scientists, planetary scientists, artificial intelligence experts. I’m the head of strategic partnerships for the largest asteroid-mining company in the world. And I believe we can use the resources of space to save our planet. We have proven again and again that we know how to destroy an environment. Now it’s time for us to prove that we can save it. From my vantage point, I see that there\'s more computing power in your car’s key fob than we use to send the astronauts to the Moon. That means we can do incredible things in space with cheap, affordable robots. For the very first time in history we’ve amassed the technological toolkit that we need to dispatch autonomous robotic explorers out into the solar system to find and access these resources and put them to work. Imagine a future where the resources we need do not only come from this planet, a future where we have access to the vast resources of space and we are using them to improve life here on Earth. That’s the future I’m going to show you. It all starts with water. See, today if you want water in space you have to take that resource, you have to load it onto a rocket and launch it into space. Now, that’s a shame because there’s a lot of water in space. There’s water on asteroids, on comets, on the poles of our Moon, and on other planets. Water is everywhere in space. And that’s a good thing because water is one of the most critical resources we will need. You see, this plan involves a lot of robots, but it also involves a lot of people. People will be living and working in space to make this possible. And those people need water for sustenance, for hygiene, for growing food. But water in space is also fuel. If we pass water through an electrical field, we can produce liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. That’s high-efficiency rocket propellant. So if the source water from space and turn it into rocket propellant, we can set up fuel depots in the solar system, gas stations! And when we do that, for the first time we have access to this new resource base because we’re not trying to launch all our fuel from Earth. And now that we have access, we can turn our sights to the next step: construction. You see, asteroids are also made of pure, high-quality metals: nickel, iron, cobalt, platinum. This is the first object that was created from an asteroid. It was the 3D-printed from a meteorite. It’s very heavy, it’s very strong, you’d never want to launch something like this into space from Earth. But if you source metals from space and feed them to orbital construction robots - which by the way, that\'s already a thing, we already have that - then you can create structures that are no longer limited by size. See, this is the International Space Station. It is the most expensive object humans have ever built. It cost a hundred billion dollars. Why was it so expensive? Well, it was created using the resources of Earth, that were turned into products, loaded onto rockets, launched into space and then assembled by humans. But that’s backwards. It doesn’t make sense anymore. That’s like roughly the equivalent of you living in Europe and saying, ""I’m going to move to the United States and build a house there, but I’m going to ship all the materials to build that house across the ocean; all of the wood, the metal, the plumbing, the electrical, the shower heads, I\'m going to ship it across the ocean,\'\' when all of the resources you need are already there at your destination. It doesn\'t make sense. We can reduce the cost and logistical inefficiencies of building large livable structures in space by a factor of a hundred by simply sourcing what we need from our destination. So we can build things in space! What should we build? Well, energy is the single largest driver of resource consumption in the world. We mine for coal. We drill for oil and natural gas. We mine for metals to build our wind plants. We mine for silicon to make our solar panels. We mine for nickel to make batteries so we can store it. One thing remains the same. As the population grows, so does the energy demand, so does the resource consumption that goes with it. We\'ve always assumed that our energy production must happen here on Earth because there\'s never been an alternative, because we haven\'t built one. If we use the resources of space, we can create massive, kilometer-scale solar farms in space. These huge facilities will capture the energy of the sun, that shines in space 24 hours a day, and beam that energy back to Earth. The technology to do this exists today, but it\'s simply too expensive when we try to use the resources of Earth. But if we use the resources in space, we can create planetary-scale macrogrids. You\'ve heard of the electricity grid, maybe you\'ve heard of the microgrid. This is the opposite. This is a planetary-scale, power-generation system. It\'s the energy that we need and the energy is in space. It\'s not the resources buried under our feet. So we have water, fuel, construction capabilities, now power, we have all of the utilities we need to build cities in space. Orbital megastructures spun up to produce artificial gravity so they\'re livable for large populations. These are emerging today as commercial space stations. They\'re research labs for sovereign astronauts from around the world; hotels for adventurous tourists, certainly. But the primary function of these facilities will be manufacturing. We will build things in space. It starts with satellites and spacecraft. Why would we want to build satellites in space? Today when we build a satellite, it\'s constrained by the rocket that takes it to space. It has to be built and designed to fit on top of that rocket. And it has to be designed to survive the violent rocket launch to the atmosphere. (Mimicking a rocket) (Laughter) But if we remove that constraint, we can build things that are as big as our imagination and vastly more capable. And if we\'ve come this far, we can take the final step and we can start to solve our resource crisis. We can move our industrial manufacturing into space, all of it. You see, manufacturing is resource consumption. We use the resources of Earth, we turn them into manufactured products, so we can sell them and do useful things. That is what drives commerce on Earth. But what if we reverse that? What if we gather and harvest all of our raw materials and resources from deep space and import them to an orbital manufacturing ring around the planet, and then return only the finished products to the surface? Let\'s use your smartphone as an example. This was created using raw materials from Earth. Yet, every single one of the raw materials in this exists in infinite quantities in space. The most expensive component of your phone is platinum, and platinum is readily available in near-earth asteroids passing by us all the time. This is created here on Earth using the resources of Earth, in a factory that produces emissions, consumes resources. They use toxic chemicals like benzene to produce this. And that factory produces hazardous waste that\'s the byproduct of manufacturing. That\'s the bad stuff: poisons, toxins, heavy metals, radiation. The problem is all of the hazardous waste from manufacturing is stuck with us here in the finite ecosystem that we live in. It\'s poisoning our air, our water, our fish, our wildlife, our food our kids! Do you know where this should not be made? (Laughter) (Breathing in) (Breathing out) (Laughter) In the only breathable atmosphere that we know of anywhere, a resource that we take for granted every minute of every day. So if we do this, we reverse the human supply chain, we push all of our mining and manufacturing outside the atmosphere, what have we done? We\'ve now zoned the Earth for residential access only. Imagine if you walked outside one day and there were no factories, no power plants, no refineries, no oil rigs, no pipelines to protest, and instead we simply allowed the planet to return to a more natural state, we intentionally stabilized our environment. We\'d have more space here on Earth, more room for the population, because we\'re not trying to live on top of our consumable resource base. And to be clear, this is not a vision about scarcity. And yes, we still have to conserve all of the precious resources we have here at home. But this is a vision about abundance. It\'s about having access to all of the resources we need to grow as a civilization. They\'re simply coming from a different place. Now, I know, I know this sounds impossible, but it\'s happening fast, faster than you could ever imagine, and it\'s already started. My kids are two. By the time they\'re in high school, they will see operational asteroid mines. They\'ll grow up in a world knowing that the resources we need do not simply come from only this planet. As a parent this gives me a lot of hope, because I want to create a world for those kids that gets better and better, not worse and worse. And when someone asks them, ""Why we should be exploring space when we have so many problems here at home?"", they will know the answer to that. The resources of space are the solutions to our greatest problems. It is only by exploring space that we safeguard this world, the one that matters the most. This is what I ask of you: believe that this is possible, because for the very first time in human history, it is possible. When we access the infinite resources of space, we do so so we can protect and preserve the single most important asset that we know of anywhere in the universe, the only place that we know of that can support human life: our home, Earth. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

For many, mobile homes offer a way to break into homeownership. But owning a mobile home is risky, because these communities are virtually invisible and have few rights. Sociologist Esther Sullivan lists the reasons why mobile homeownership is so insecure, and discusses ways to preserve one of America's best options for affordable housing.",,19681,2018-09-04T15:58:01+00:00,"['homelessness', 'life', 'architecture', 'urban planning']",['English'],Esther Sullivan,Equal Housing Maven,"{'0:00': 'Right now, there is no state in the nation where a person working full-time for minimum wage can afford rent for a fair-market, one-bedroom home. In fact, affordable housing is so hard to find you\'ll actually spend less of your income if you can afford to buy a house rather than rent. But even an entry-level home, the cheapest homes on the market, will cost you $370,000 in L.A., $245K in Boston, $222K in Denver. What if instead you could buy a brand new, three-bedroom, two-bathroom home for $45,000, which would put your total housing costs somewhere in the range of $400-700 per month? (Cheers) (Applause) Right, exactly! It seems like you\'d be crazy not to jump at the opportunity. Well, 18 million Americans are already in on the secret. They\'ve achieved the American dream of homeownership and they\'ve done it on a budget. How? You\'re totally hoping I\'m going to say ""tiny home."" (Laughter) Mmmm. Alright. Well sort of. Enter the mobile home. Okay, it lacks all the hype, but 18 million Americans live in one. In fact, one in every five new single-family homes sold is a mobile home, and that\'s a serious statistic. It\'s serious because homeownership has long been a source of stability and a principal source of wealth in the U.S. And mobile homes are a primary way that low-income households break into homeownership and start building that wealth. Mobile homes provide a massive source of owner-occupied affordable housing at a time when the U.S. has a major affordable housing problem. We hear that a lot, right? We\'re in an affordable housing crisis. But what does that really mean? It means we don\'t have enough housing to meet the needs of millions. At the lowest income levels, the people who really need housing help, we\'re short 7.4 million units. That\'s just 35 affordable units for every 100 households that need it. The good news is that cities have begun to recognize that access to quality affordable housing is good for everyone, not just those that need it, but larger communities as well. Sociologists like myself, who study housing, show us why. Housing is an incredible source of stability, which translates into positive educational outcomes, health benefits, employment opportunities, and neighborhood safety. So recognizing this, cities are building some affordable units, but many remain unaffordable for low-income people. This problem is simply too big. We can\'t just build our way out of it. If we\'re serious about solving it, we need to preserve the affordable housing that we already have. Enter, once again, the mobile home. Mobile homes are this country\'s single largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing, and could play a major role in addressing our affordable housing crisis, but there\'s a problem. One of our largest sources of affordable housing is also one of our most insecure. Mobile homes are insecure for two reasons which are like two trains heading right for each other. The first reason isn\'t the home itself; it\'s the land. About a third of mobile homes are installed in mobile home parks, where residents own the home but rent the land. Now, this is part of what makes the housing so affordable, but it also means that homeowners can be evicted at any time if the property owner decides to sell or redevelop the park. The second reason they\'re insecure is they\'re invisible. Think for a second about the mobile home park closest to your house. Some of you can probably picture it. Maybe it\'s off a highway, behind a strip mall. But many of you might not actually know where the nearest mobile home park is, and that\'s not by accident. That\'s by design. For over a century, planning and zoning regulations have required that mobile home parks be walled in, fenced off, and, in the language of planners, visually screened from view. But perhaps the most damning of these regulations comes from laws that don\'t allow mobile home parks to be established near conventional housing. As a result, mobile home parks are disproportionately located in commercial and industrial areas. So now you can see those two trains about to collide, right? When communities of homeowners that rent the land are isolated onto commercial properties owned by a third party, they\'re the first victims of urban growth. When a big-box store is looking for a place to build, a mobile home park is an easy target. Mobile home park brokers actually make a living selling off parks for redevelopment. One broker told me that Walmart is his best client. When parks are redeveloped, communities of homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades are evicted with as little as 30 days\' notice, and entire communities are dismantled. And this is happening at an alarming rate, right now. We have an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet we are allowing one of our largest sources of affordable housing to disappear. As a sociologist, I wanted to document the effects of these mass evictions, so beginning in 2012, I rented a mobile home inside closing parks, first in Florida and then in Texas. I moved in and lived beside neighbors over 17 consecutive months as they scrambled to deal with their eviction. I then followed them for six more months after they were evicted. This is what I learned. The term ""mobile home"" is a complete misnomer. Mobile homes are not RVs, they\'re not campers. They\'re not intended to be mobile once they\'re first transported from the factory. Once installed on land, just like any other home, they settle. Moving them can cause serious structural damage and cost up to $15,000, and all of that is if they can be moved. In the parks where I lived, lucky residents lost entire savings and months of their lives dealing with eviction. Unlucky residents lost everything. Their homes were not structurally sound for relocation, and they were forced to abandon them. These residents were real people, like my neighbor Stella. Stella prided herself on being able to live independently at the age of 87. Stella was blind and completely homebound, but her cheap rent and knowing every corner of her mobile home had made that possible. Stella had paid off her home many years ago, but when her park closed, she couldn\'t afford to move it on her $790 Social Security check. In the end, Stella lost her home of 20 years and her prized independence. She moved into a guest room in her son\'s apartment. Two blocks over from Stella, Randall meticulously maintained his home. It was the first home he\'d ever owned. The first time he had me over, he apologized for it being so messy, but then he later admitted he\'d just been scrubbing the cabinets. Randall learned that this home could not be moved, and he desperately searched for housing nearby so he could keep his job. But he found nothing he could afford, even after months. On the day before Randall\'s park closed, he transitioned from homeowner to homeless, and to this day, he sleeps on a park bench about a mile from where his home once was. When these parks close, residents lose homes but also neighbors and social supports. So Stella lost the neighbors who would come and check on her, and Randall lost the people who could give him a ride when he needed it. Randall and Stella are just two of about 200 evicted homeowners I met during those two years, and while everyone\'s story is a little different, the common reality is that mobile home park closures create a cycle of housing instability that extends well beyond these moments of eviction, and that affects all of us. Housing instability means that local teachers get an influx of new kids partway through the year. It means social service providers are stretched thin managing new caseloads. It means small businesses lose reliable employees. Zoning communities into invisibility creates housing instability. But more than that, it creates social vulnerability because it\'s hard to care about what you don\'t see. But there\'s hope because over the last century we\'ve solved some of our toughest housing challenges by shining a spotlight on invisible problems. We passed the first progressive tenement housing reforms only after a photojournalist showed the world the unsafe conditions in crowded slums. We passed the Fair Housing Act only after African American Vietnam vets showed us that they\'d risked their lives for this country but couldn\'t buy a home in a white neighborhood. We passed the housing measures in the Americans with Disabilities Act only after activists with disabilities demonstrated that they couldn\'t fit through a standard entrance and into a home. So perhaps we\'re primed to bring this next housing challenge into the light. And that starts by working to change some of the very regulations that keep mobile home parks invisible. We\'re ready for this. I mean, you\'re already binge-watching ""tiny house"" shows on HGTV. (Laughter) Your Facebook feed is full of them, you love them, you want to retire in one. So we\'re ready to push for new policies that better integrate different forms of housing into the fabric of our residential communities. And we\'re ready to address that underlying land ownership issue too. We already have a model to follow: the condo model, where residents own their unit and hold the condo property collectively. There are parks that have actually tried this and it\'s working. In about 200 parks across the country, nonprofit groups have helped residents collectively get a loan so that they can buy their park and run it themselves, and residents in these parks report seeing immediate improvements in the maintenance, quality, and stability of their communities. But maybe we can take an even more important step to ensure housing security for everyone. If we can reshape our thinking about the mobile home park, we can go further to imagining housing as a basic human right. The UN and most developed nations recognize and have policies that affirm a human right to housing, for all of the reasons that we\'ve been talking about. It\'s hard to have health, wealth, and stability if you don\'t have a roof over your head. Plus, housing insecurity is expensive. It has costs for social services, businesses, schools. Those are costs we all bear, so a dollar spent on housing is a dollar saved on healthcare, infrastructure, and education. Yet the U.S. remains the only developed nation that doesn\'t guarantee a fundamental human right to shelter, but perhaps it\'s time to change that. (Applause) So if we want to, then that\'s going to require enacting legislation and shifting budgetary priorities, absolutely, but we\'ve made just these kind of legislative shifts before. And it turns out that the mobile home park provides a pretty good roadmap for why and how we should do this. Parks show us the value of homeownership for all income levels. Parks even show us how we might imagine new, collective forms of property ownership. And most importantly, parks show us that entire cities can benefit when housing is secure for everyone. Housing is one of our most fundamental human needs and perhaps our biggest blindspot. Let\'s bring our attention back home so we can create communities that work for all of us. Thank you.

It\'s customary for meadowlarks to sing toward the rising sun. This one, however, was mistaken by the lights of Rapid City at 2 AM. Despite being 60 miles south of the Rapid City border and well within the boundaries of Wind Cave National Park, this songbird was singing out much too late to attract a mate. Have you ever tried attracting a mate by calling them at 2 AM? (Laughter) My mother told me nothing good happens after midnight. (Laughter) So why was this songbird so confused, mistaking the bright lights of Rapid City for the rising sun at 2 AM? Improper lighting and the over-illumination of residential neighborhoods, business signage, and street lights brighten our night sky, creating an orange hue above the city for miles outside its border. Over 100 years ago, all creatures could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky. But now, eight out of ten children will never see the Milky Way from where they live. Light pollution doesn\'t only impact our view of the universe, it also impacts our environment, our individual health, and energy consumption. The three main components of light pollution include sky glow as well as glare and light trespass, which I will also explain. Glare is the excessive brightness that causes us visual discomfort. We often illuminate areas in attempt to increase safety. As children, we\'re afraid of the dark, so we flip on a night switch because ""the night is dark and full of terrors."" And as adults, we do that now on a much grander scale. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health looked at statistics where researchers studied lights that were turned on at certain hours, dimmed, or turned off completely, and found that it had no impact on traffic collisions or crime. I want you to take a very close look at this picture. Mentally note what you see. With properly shielded lights, we can actually see what was there the entire time. Brighter does not mean safer. The third component of light pollution is light trespass. To understand this, I want you to envision your bedroom. Could you sleep at night with no curtains? Or do you need those blackout shades tucked into every single crevice of that window pane, just in order to get a good night\'s sleep? If so, that is because of light trespass, the shining of light where it\'s unneeded, and unintended, and unwanted, from another source originating somewhere other than your own. Now that we\'ve looked at what causes light pollution, let\'s take a look at where light pollution is. Here is a global map with light pollution depicted by various colors. Let\'s zoom in to our local area of impact. This is Rapid City. We are on the front lines of a battle of lights versus dark. Zooming in closer to South Dakota, I want you to envision that you\'re downtown at Main Street Square, you\'ve got your blanket, your chair, you\'re ready to stargaze. And then you look up, and you realize you can see relatively very few stars. You cannot even see the Big Dipper. So you pack up all your belongings,  you get in the car, you drive to the city limits, where now you\'re in the orange zone, where eight out of ten Americans live, and we have a local observatory. You look up, you still cannot see the Milky Way. You keep on driving, you go deep into the Black Hills National Forest, and then you see it, the sky glow the meadowlark was singing toward. To get to a naturally dark sky, you would have to drive two hours north, to the corner of northwest South Dakota, an area called Slim Buttes, which has a Class 1 dark sky, a naturally lit sky, where the stars from the Milky Way shine so bright it will cast a shadow of you on the ground. Rapid City is a Class 9 sky, the brightest depicted on the map, where light pollution is 100 up to 200 times brighter than our natural darkness. You cannot make out the North Star. But the thing is Rapid City is not alone. Light pollution plagues every modern city and town. The good news, however, is that light pollution could possibly be the simplest problem to solve and could literally be done overnight, simply with the flip of a switch. So if at any point in this presentation you decide that it\'s important to protect our dark skies, I ask you to turn off your light in front of you, simply by twisting it off. Now just like in real life, here\'s a hint: You can ask your neighbor to shut off their light as well if their light is trespassing into your area and inhibiting your view of a TEDx presentation. (Laughter) Even if we all turn out our lights, more is needed to be done. One hundred years ago, this is the view from Skyline Drive you would have seen. Today, this is a picture taken this year during the Rapid City Dark Earth Hour. Which one do you prefer? So what are we going to do if we all turn out our lights and it\'s still bright? We need to protect nocturnal habitats, stargazing opportunities, and our nocturnal plants and animals. Now, bats. There\'s an idea. I know what we can do. Let\'s call Batman! He\'ll know what to do! Send the bat signal! Right? Oh, wait, maybe he didn\'t get the memo either. So let\'s shift our focus to nocturnal plants. In the Black Hills, there\'s a moonflower that blooms only in dark nights. (Music) (Music ends) Earth evolved with bright days and dark nights. Another example of nocturnal life that needs darkness is the owl. Owls see five times brighter than we do as humans because in their eyes they have light detecting rods that are numbered at one million rods per square millimeter. Just because we can see with lights at night doesn\'t mean other creatures can. But even though we can see with artificial light at night, doesn\'t mean that it\'s healthy for us. The American Medical Association states ""all creatures need darkness to survive."" As light travels through our eye, it goes to a tract of a nucleus cluster of thousands of cells that send messages to our glands. Those glands secrete a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin. The great thing about melatonin is it has great antioxidant qualities that rid our brain and body of free radicals that cause damage to our brain and body. The Journal of Epidemiology Research shows that exposure to artificial light at night has been linked to an increase in Alzheimer\'s, breast cancer, obesity, and depression. Let\'s take a look now at what our future holds. The map I showed you of South Dakota is a one from 1997, when in all reality, tonight\'s dark skies is much more closely, really, like the map of 2025. In only eight years, it\'s estimated that just eight dark sky places will remain in the United States. So if we can\'t call Batman, what are we supposed to do? OK, I have another idea, hold on with me, this is a little bit better. Let\'s join the Dark Side. Maybe Kylo Ren and Darth Vader had it right all along. But all joking aside, there really is something about the color spectrum. This is a color Kelvin chart, rating color by its temperature. The International Dark Sky Association rates colors below 3,000 Kelvins as dark sky friendly because it doesn\'t impair night vision. What else can we do? Address our fixtures, because dark skies doesn\'t have to mean dark ground. We can point lights down, where the light is intended. The International Dark Sky Association estimates that all of the outdoor lighting wastes 30 percent of light that goes outward and upward where it is not needed or intended, wasting money and creating more carbon emissions. In addition, this is a sample of a front porch light that could be converted into a full cutoff fixture, reducing glare, sky glow, and light trespass. Streetlights that point light outward and upward could be retrofitted to point the light downward. Paris, the City of Light, took solving light pollution to a whole new level. They enacted a lights-out curfew of 1 AM or one hour past the last employee\'s departure time. I challenge you to find your reason for #LightsOut. I wish you all a very dark night. (Applause)'}",

[Who is this?] You may notice, aside from the color harmony, a tattoo saying: ""My body belongs to me."" But who is this person? Is it a punk, who borrowed clothes from their grandmother\'s wardrobe? Is it a teenager, from the 16th arrondissement of Paris, who feels like rebelling? No. This is our Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, standing on the steps of the Élysée. And this was last year, to celebrate the 40th year of the Veil Abortion Act, which enables women to take control of their bodies, through a voluntary interruption of their pregnancy. ""My body belongs to me"" has become banal -- everyone says it. By the way, for once, the entire National Assembly has voted in favor of a symbolic law in order to reapprove the Veil Law. It\'s a banality, even ministers have it tattooed on their arm. However, it\'s not entirely true. I would like to give you a few examples, that are a little extreme, honestly even shocking, which will demonstrate that for many people and in a lot of cases, well, my body doesn\'t belong to me. Firstly, it doesn\'t belong to me as long as I\'m alive. I am not allowed to rent my belly. I am not allowed in many countries to sell my sexuality. I am not allowed to define the gender that I belong to, since I have to face a doctor or be in front of a judge, and declare to the civil registrar whether I am a man, woman, or other. I am also not allowed to do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I can\'t do this. [Dwarf-tossing] So, You might recognize Leonardo Di Caprio, in this great dwarf-tossing scene. But some versions of it exist that are a little less chic, notably the one that was practiced by the great community of Morsang-sur-Orge from l\'Essonne, in the beginning of the 90s. The mayor of Morsang-sur-Orge said: ""This can\'t go on -- we can\'t toss dwarfs.""\x94 And so he prohibited dwarf-tossing. And who was to protest? Dwarf-tossers found other activities to do on Sundays. They probably went back to fishing. It\'s the dwarves themselves who protested, because they had a breadwinner, and a certain renown, apparently a certain success with women. And the Morsang-sur-Orges Council of State\'s decision, which jurists know well, said: ""No, this is forbidden."" I also cannot do whatever I want with my body in order to die. I am not allowed to be euthanized, but I am also not allowed to be eaten. In 2001, a charming German engineer posted an announcement saying: ""I am looking for a volunteer to eat."" He received several candidates, made a selection, conducted a few final interviews, and in the end finally found Bernt, who agreed wholeheartedly. So they began by cutting off Bernt\'s genital and eating it together, probably by candlelight. (Laughter) Obviously satisfied by this first course, they chose to proceed -- and by the way this all on video so you can watch it. I recommend it to you, it\'s really nice -- ""Armine ate Bernt."" But be aware that this is prohibited. It\'s crazy, considering they haven\'t hurt anyone. But it is indeed prohibited to be eaten. Well, even after my death I can\'t do whatever I want with my body. For instance, I am not allowed to practice sea-immersion whereas diving is allowed while I am alive. I am also not allowed to be embalmed, unless my name is Lenin, Mao, or Valéry Giscard d\'Estaing. (Laughter) (Applause) And I am also not allowed -- and this is even worse -- to be cryogenized. You know, some people -- have themselves frozen, hoping that in 10 years, 100 years, or a million years, we would defrost them, as by then we will have already found ways to resuscitate them, or found cures to the illnesses that have killed them. This has been somewhat a success. In Russia and the United States, there are some cryogenic sites, where one can see the coffins. Some put their entire body, while others only their head -- it\'s cheaper. (laughter) And in France, a doctor named Martineau, felt that it was a great idea to freeze his wife first. (Laughter) And as it seemed to be going well, he decided to follow her with the freezing. Forever united in a frozen sleep, inside a castle. And then someone found out and filed a complaint: There are some people frozen in the village, do you realize that?\x94 (Laughter) Their son was delighted. He would go to see them from time to time. It\'s better than gathering around a grave. And the Council of State, that same one, said: ""This can\'t be happening. You need to defrost and burn them! Put it all on fire. Then there was a trial, and Martineau\'s son was forced to burn his parents. Can you imagine, this poor couple who imagined being united for millions of years and resuscitate in a future where sexuality is completely open, completely vivified and rejuvenated. Well, unfortunately, there is only a heap of ashes left. (Laughter) So behind these tragedies -- they don\'t concern us all if we don\'t wish to be eaten, frozen, or tossed -- who cares. But the problem is that it actually applies to each one of us. It\'s the Civil Code via the bioethics law of 1994 that says so. The conventions -- as you can read -- are that there is no private ownership or patrimoniality over the body, because we say that the person is unavailable under law. And so the body itself isn\'t patrimonial. You don\'t have an ownership of your body. And so you might tell me: ""So what, everything in France is forbidden anyway."" (Laughter) But even in the US, a country supposedly liberal, it\'s the same story. It has, by the way, been declared very clearly at a trial in the Supreme Court of California. The John Moore case. John Moore was a patient suffering from leukemia, in the 80s, and the doctors had to remove his spleen. They discovered that his cells had extraordinary properties for producing certain kind of proteins. So the doctors extracted, without telling John Moore, many of his cells. They extracted blood, sperm, and parts of the spinal cord. They apparently told him that in order to treat his leukemia they had to remove some sperm -- that\'s apparently what happened. (Laughter) And they made a cell line out of it. John Moore\'s cell line. Which they then sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars to big pharmaceutical institutions. And John Moore, upon realizing what has happened, said: ""Wait a minute, I don\'t get to have a say? These are my cells, if you don\'t mind."" And so there was a big trial, and the judge concluded that, no, they aren\'t his cells in fact, given that he doesn\'t have ownership over his cells. So, where does all of this come from? There are good reasons to think that it came from a monotheistic heritage. This idea -- as Saint Paul put it: ""The body is for the Lord and the Lord is for the body."" -- is that in the big monotheism, particularly within Judeo-Christian religions, my body doesn\'t belong to me because it belongs to God. My body is the expression of the soul, as per Thomas d\'Aquin. The body is the reflection of my soul, my soul is immortal. It joins the kingdom of heaven. By the way, I can even be resuscitated if the Council of State hasn\'t burned me first. (Laughter) Pope Pie XII has claimed it very explicitly -- this is the first time I\'m quoting Pope Pie XII publicly. In 1954, at a medical congress, he explained that Man is merely a usufructuary of his body, not its full owner. So within our secular law system, a secularized system, it is not a matter of God anymore, well the concept of God has been replaced by the concept of dignity. Going back to that trial in Morsang-sur-Orge, this is the reason why the Council of State has prohibited dwarf-tossing, because a human being\'s dignity is viewed as being part of the public order. It means that today, this transcendence we have abolished, this divine transcendence, is being retaken by the State, or by society if you prefer, defining everyone\'s dignity. So dignity is sacredness without God. It\'s the idea that, nonetheless, the body is sacred. We cannot do whatever we want with it. I suggest that you try and go to the end of the modernity logic. And if we are really, completely within immanence, to whom does the body belong, if not to me? Who can define its dignity, if not me? That\'s what John Lock did, not John Moore, but John Locke. Indeed, there are many Johns. He was the first person to have written, to my knowledge, that each person has ownership over their own personhood. It\'s not a coincidence that he is the one who wrote that, He was a doctor, and well-acquainted with flesh, the body\'s reactions. And also because he was in the midst of the glorious British revolution, the Bill of Rights Revolution. So this whole theory about social contract rights, about elementary, fundamental rights, about civil disobedience, also means that one has natural rights that are predetermined among which, the right of ownership of oneself. He went even further by saying: ""If can have ownership over exterior things, if I can acquire the world by working on it, by adding value to it,"" -- this idea of property was first born out of the appropriation of myself. And think about it, if we have ownership over the body, we have, according to classical themes, the usus, fructus and abusus. Usus means -- it\'s always nice using Latin terms -- usus means usage. So if I have usus over the body, the dwarfs can do their work with dignity. Then, fructus, we have it fructified and so John Moore can have access to his cell money. And then you have abusus, I can abuse it and do whatever I want with it, and if I want to have it cryogenized, that\'s my problem. It appears to me that this new generation is a generation that rejects predetermined structures, one that wants to define their own career, that wants to define their life by traveling, and to build themselves, their own self, be their own creator. And we can see, anecdotally, sociologically, to what extent this generation who appropriates their own body with tattoos for instance, It\'s also a way to define one\'s sexuality in a much more fluid way. There is a study that came out which showed that generation Z - it\'s not even Y anymore, it\'s Z -- Generation Z is post-gender. It\'s not even bi anymore, everyone defines their own sexuality by adding a little bit of this or that. So this results in many things. For instance, one can be half-sexual, Grey-sexual, gyno-sexual, pan-sexual, Strauss-Kahn sexual -- No, not that. Anyway, there are many versions. I don\'t know all of them, and can\'t describe them on stage. But it\'s interesting, you should look them up. And more importantly, it will allow us to tackle the three big themes of the future: The subject of human augmentation, the enhancement of oneself, the theme of transhumanism, and the theme of data. If tomorrow I can, and I already can enhance myself, that\'s to say building my own artificial arms, enhancing my limbs, enhancing my brain abilities, even modifying my own DNA. If I modify my own DNA, I must be its owner. If tomorrow I want to test, I want to explore immortality, be it through cryogenisation -- here is that nice example again. Or for instance, as Ray Kurzweil, the Pope of transhumanism, envisions it, by transferring my consciousness onto a USB key. Well, similarly, I am going to define, even contractually, the way in which my body relates to the world. And then there is a third question that might seem a little marginal, the question of data. We produce, a large amount of data, and its value is humongous. as in Europe, it\'s estimated be worth a thousand billion euros by 2020. However, this data, which is worth so much money and with which some companies make so much money, well, your personal data doesn\'t belong to you. In the same way there isn\'t a patrimoniality of the body, there isn\'t a patrimoniality of data. For the exact same reasons, because data is considered to be an expression of your personality, and as we saw, within the law, the personality is inalienable and the body isn\'t patrimonial. If tomorrow we find, that we are able to build a private property for data, which will be to the digital age what intellectual property was to the industrial revolution, you will then become an owner, in truly legal and financial terms, of your own data, which you will be able to negotiate. In other words: you will finally get paid for using Facebook. So, ""my body belongs to me"" isn\'t a platitude. It\'s a tattoo we would finally all wear. Because this brand new generation will have to confront all these problems. Transhumanism is coming, bioethical committees are already outdated. And in order for everyone to able to choose their own values, in this complex universe, we must first own our own bodies. Thank you!'}",

I\'m from India. The home of ancient mathematics. But me, I just hated math. (Laughter) Until it saved my life. I grew up in Akola, a small town 700 miles away from the capital city. In my community, we never had a culture of girls attending school beyond the age of 10 or 12 years. In fact, some women would tell me, ""Why do you need education? Just learn the household work so that you can take care of your family."" But I never wanted to abide myself by the ""normal"" rules for girls. And I would think to myself, instead of just learning the household work, why not learn how to make money so that I can actually take care of my family? (Laughter) I knew if I had to do something different, I would have to stay in school. But that was hard. As it was socially not accepted, everybody was against it. But I was a stubborn young girl. I did everything I could to continue studying, even if that meant stitching school uniforms or making festival greeting cards. I did all that. Well, I had excellent grades in all subjects. All except one. You guessed it: math. All these calculations, formulas, multiplication; I just couldn\'t get them right. After I finished college, I realized I had no future in Akola, so I decided to do something almost nobody in my town had ever done before: to leave my home town, by myself, a single woman. Nobody wanted me to do that. I remember when I walked up to my mom and told her, ""Mama, I\'m leaving."" She looked at me and said, ""Uma, I know how difficult it is for you and even for me, and I cannot even support you openly, but I want you to have this."" And she hands me a gold bangle. That was the only jewelry left with her. She said, ""I don\'t have much but this is for you to buy the bus ticket."" You can see the bus ticket here. It\'s been ten years. I still have this. As a promise that I won\'t let my mom sacrifice anything more for me. So, on 22nd of July, 2007, I arrived in Pune, a city of four million people. I had never been out of my village before  so being in the city for the first time, I was mesmerized and excited. And scared as well. I didn\'t even know if I could trust the taxi driver while taking the taxi for the first time in an unknown city. Life in the city was extremely hard at first. I was away from my family, didn\'t have any friends. I had brought very little money with me; around three and a half dollars. So I used to eat every second day - every other day - so that I can save as much as I can. Yes, good things take time, but they do happen. And finally, it happened to me. I was given an opportunity to work in a primary school, as a teacher. Wow, I was so happy. Until I got to know the subject they gave me to teach. (Laughter) Yes, it was math. (Laughter) And I\'m like, ""Oh God, how will I teach something I hate so much?"" (Laughter) But I had no choice so I started teaching math. You know, the basics like multiplication tables. I remember I struggled every night to figure out lessons for my students. I was hating it. And I was afraid if I didn\'t do well, I might not make it. But the more I worked on it, trying to make it interesting, trying to make it fun, the more I realized the pattern in these numbers. As if these multiplication tables were sending me a message, I sensed as if these numbers were talking to me. And that\'s when I figured out the magic these odd and even numbers have; the poetry, the symmetry they have. Let me show you what I mean: Let\'s look at table of three for example. Feels like we are back in school? (Laughter) Three, we all know it\'s an odd number. And if I multiply three with another odd number, it gives me a result which is definitely an odd number. Like this one here: Three times three gives us nine.  An odd number. And then I noticed something very interesting about it. If I multiply an odd number with an even number, it ultimately becomes an even number, like this one here. Three times four gives us 12. An even number. So, odd multiplied with odd, the result has to definitely be an odd number. But odd multiplied with something even, no matter how many times you do it, it will definitely give us an even number. And I\'m like, this is quite me. With all the odds I was up against, if I multiply my odd situation, with my odd behavior ... (Laughter) (Applause) So what happens? I get myself into another odd situation. (Laughter) But the magic is, if I multiply my odd situations with my even behavior, with my positive behavior, it gets me to better results, to even results. And if one doesn\'t stop when the situations are odd like this, if one keeps pushing himself, keeps multiplying his blessings, keeps multiplying his skills, even though the beginning is, the end will never be odd. Wow, so once I got to know this, I was like, if something odd can teach me such a valuable lesson of life, I\'m sure there is something interesting about the even numbers as well. (Laughter) So, let\'s look at table of two, for example. What I notice here is every time, right from the beginning to the end, all multiplication results are even, without any odds. And how is it possible? That\'s possible because the number itself which is getting multiplied, is an even number. This tells me if I am even to myself, as an individual, nothing odd will come my way. (Laughter) Now this of course doesn\'t mean I don\'t come across any odd or bad situations. I certainly do. But facing them with even attitude makes the whole difference. That\'s how, even though I have to struggle hard for my basic rights, instead of being upset and angry, I am happy and even to myself, because the struggle made me stronger, made me who I am today. Now I have these learnings, these secrets from all different multiplication tables. One of my favorites is table of 11. And I think most of us liked, when we were in school, because that is the easiest one to multiply. What I love about this is the perfect symmetry in it. The one and one, the two and two. Isn\'t that beautiful? And easy, of course. For me, the question was: How can I have my life this similarly easy and beautiful? For me these two symmetrical numbers reflect the outside me and the inside me. I can live in harmony, I can live in peace  only when my outside matches my inner being. Isn\'t this all we\'re looking for? We can be anybody; maybe two, maybe three. Whoever we are, unless or until our inside personality matches our outside personality, our outside personality matches our inside personality, we cannot live in peace, we cannot live in harmony. Now, because math became my art, became my reminder, my guide of what I needed to do, and what my goal was, I started loving math. Because of this, I was not only able to keep my job, but also make it interesting for others. Now ten years down the line, I have a wonderful job in a great company. I am able to move my entire family to Pune to live with me. Now nobody says I shouldn\'t have done this. Rather everyone appreciates for what I stood for. As kids, we all are asked to solve math problems. But in reality, math solved many of my problems. Thank you for having me. Dhanyavaad (Thank you). (Applause) (Cheers)'}",

Writer. Realistic Idealist.,"{'0:00': 'In May of this year, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue on his show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" about his newborn son who was diagnosed with a rare heart defect after an astute nurse noticed something wasn\'t quite right with the baby just hours after his birth. Kimmel sang the praises of this nurse and the entire healthcare team who cared for his son through the process of open-heart surgery. His monologue highlighted the reality that no one, not even a celebrity, is immune from unexpected health crises. At some point, each one of us will be profoundly affected by illness, be it in you, or in someone you love. And every health crisis benefits from an open-hearted nurse who is willing to come alongside the patient and family in some of the most challenging times of life. I\'m a critical care nurse, and like many of my colleagues, I went into nursing because I wanted to be a therapeutic presence for others. I envisioned the profession to be one where I lived on the highs - not from being elevated by a celebrity\'s monologue, but from feeling like I was always doing something meaningful and helpful for others. I thought that the highs alone would be enough to help me cope with the intense stress and heartache that come from taking care of so many sick and sometimes dying patients. But as I rode the roller coaster of suffering with my patients and their families, I quickly understood that I was going to need something more than the intermittent feel-good moments to sustain me through the lows. And this isn\'t just true for me. Recent literature shows that nurses everywhere are battling this challenge. Currently, 25 to 33% of critical care nurses show symptoms of severe burnout, which is not just emotional and physical exhaustion but also a feeling of personal detachment from their job. Current annual turnover rates among critical care nurses range between 13 to 20%, which is higher than the overall turnover rate for other professions. These statistics can be disheartening, given that many of us will rely on a nurse at some point in our lives. In our times of weakness, vulnerability and helplessness, we need nurses who have found a way to preserve meaning, and commitment to their work. While many external factors contributing to burnout have been studied, I\'ve been asking what we nurses are to do with the internal issue of grief - not in terms of caring for others in their grief, but working through our own grief on a deeper level as we are affected by the suffering of our patients and their families. How do I endure through the lows that come with this profession? I endure by allowing my natural response of grief to teach me its life-giving lessons. Grief kind of has a bad rap. It\'s seen as something unnatural, something to be avoided as much as possible in order to survive. It\'s seen as a thief of life. But consider this: When I spend an entire 12-hour shift with a patient who, just a few days prior, was a healthy, free-wheeling teenager who jumped into a pool the wrong way and has now been told that he will never use his arms or legs again because of a severed spinal cord, grief will be one of the most natural and predominant emotions for him, his family, and for me as his nurse. We can think of this grief like a river running downstream, and as the nurse, I\'m on this life raft together with my patient and his family. Grief is strong, it\'s scary, and no one really knows for sure where it\'s going to take us. But for this patient, his family, and for all of us, when we find ourselves in this kind of situation, it\'s natural. So if my endurance strategy as a nurse is to try to swim upstream against grief by way of suppression, and against the next stream and the next stream, I\'m not going to win. Eventually, I\'m not going to last. Rather than resisting grief and saying, ""It\'s just too hard to think about these issues,"" I can choose a different perspective as I accept the inevitable fact that I will be affected by grief. I can embrace my grief as a natural teacher about the deeper things I need in order to endure as a nurse. Resilience in the midst of exhaustion. Meaning in the midst of despair.  I can redefine my purpose.  When my initial idealism about life has been shaken, I can instead transform my grief and choose to use it to cultivate greater empathy for my patients and their families. These are the life-giving lessons of grief that can ultimately empower me to endure as a nurse. Research is slowly growing on the topic of grief in healthcare professionals. Marion Conti-O\'Hare is a nurse researcher who developed this perspective into a theory known as ""The Nurse as Wounded Healer,"" where the nurse learns to transform and rise above grief such that the nurse is all the more able to care for others. Along these lines, another researcher who studied post-traumatic stress in nurses has concluded that staying self-aware in grief and working through questions about the meaning of suffering can eventually grow the nurse in maturity and wisdom, both of which are life-giving tools for endurance. I have two daughters; they\'re two and four years old. About a year ago, I took care of a patient who reminded me a great deal of my younger child. No one could explain, beyond a suspected brain infection, what had made this child so sick to the point that he was not expected to survive. I was with his family in his final moments before we withdrew his life support. It was a privilege for me to be with his mother in her grief because I could very much imagine myself in her shoes, so in the moment, it was very intuitive to me how to care for her. But for a few weeks after that, I was shipwrecked by grief. It was difficult to function normally at home, and it was very difficult to go back to work. It was the kind of low in nursing that I simply couldn\'t anticipate, much less really prepare myself for, even years into the profession. I hadn\'t yet learned, at that point in my life and my career as a nurse, how to manage my own fairly new maternal instincts as they collided with this mother\'s grief. I couldn\'t navigate those new waters alone. It was a shipwreck moment for me. But it was also the moment when I learned my next life-giving lesson from my grief. I learned to develop new levels of life-giving relationships. Specifically, I\'ve slowly begun to find people in my life who courageously look at grief with me through this new lens, who look at grief not as a thief of life to be avoided at all costs, but as a difficult - yes - complicated - yes - but a natural, powerful, and irreplaceable teacher of endurance for my life as a nurse. There are amazing highs in nursing, like being able to walk with Jimmy Kimmel and his son through successful open-heart surgery. The purpose and joy in those experiences are clear. But when the lows come, the stress and heartache can be so strong that they can muddle motivation and make you question your ability to endure in the profession. But burnout does not have to be  the inevitable result of constantly giving oneself to the suffering of others. Allowing my natural response of grief to teach me its life-giving lessons may very well be the way in which I as a nurse can rise up and move forward with purposeful endurance in my profession. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

She wants us to reconnect, to understand how energy drives our world: ""Energy makes everything we do possible, yet we treat it as an insignificant other."" In an energetic talk, Wirfs-Brock shows us the four things we need to know about the energy we use.",,30194,2018-12-06T00:24:19+00:00,"['sustainability', 'energy', 'electricity', 'social change']","['English', 'Español', 'Magyar', 'العربية', '中文 (简体)']",Jordan Wirfs-Brock,Energy Storyteller,"{'0:00': 'I\'m an energy journalist and a self-proclaimed energy nerd, but today, if you\'re cool with it, I\'d like to try out a new career, and you guys are going to be my guinea pigs. I\'ll be taking on the role of relationship counselor. Okay, okay. I\'m talking about our relationship with energy, with electricity, gasoline, wind turbines, all of it. Or rather, for most of us, it\'s a lack of a relationship. See, us and energy, we don\'t talk. We\'re disconnected, estranged. Here\'s an example: When I first started covering energy, I asked a bunch of friends what questions they had. And one of my best friends, a physics professor, super smart, asked: ""Are we still burning coal?"" And I was like, huh. Are we still burning coal? Here we were, a physics PhD and an energy journalist with an engineering degree, stumped. Because here\'s the thing, ""Are we still burning coal?"" is a totally reasonable question. It\'s so easy to go through life using energy every day, every moment, while knowing next to nothing about it. Energy makes everything we do possible, and yet we treat it as an insignificant other. And because us and energy, we don\'t really talk, we\'re embarrassed to even ask questions like, ""Are we still burning coal?"" And in case you\'re curious, yes, we are; a lot of it. As a journalist, though, I get this amazing license to ask questions, however basic. And I\'ve spent nearly three years asking questions to everyone from power grid engineers to energy economists. What have I learned? It\'s a problem that most of us are on the outs with energy. I don\'t have to remind you that we\'re facing some major energy challenges, and we can\'t solve them if we treat energy as an insignificant other. But there\'s good news. The tools we need to rekindle the relationship are already here. So, to kick off our counseling session, let\'s take a step back and figure out how we ended up with this energy estrangement, this communication breakdown. What is energy, anyway? That\'s a good place to start. The physics definition in five words: energy is the capacity to do work. All that means is anything that has to move or change, energy is the stuff that makes it possible. It comes in many forms. Chilling a beer in your fridge, that takes energy. The beer itself: energy too, calories. While drinking said beer, brainstorming what you\'re going to be for Halloween, neurons are moving around in your brain using energy. And making that sweet Oompa Loompa costume - (Laughter) more energy. Yeah, that\'s me. (Laughter) No, this is important: We can move energy around, change it from one form to another, like when we burn coal to make electricity, but we can never create or destroy it. Pending advancements in space travel, what\'s here on earth and what\'s coming from the sun, that\'s all we got. Okay, on to our relationship history, the movie montage version. Jumping to pre-agricultural humans, 50,000 years ago or so, we took in energy as food, plants and animals, and we used it by doing stuff: chopping wood, going for a walk. We straight-up humans were our own industrial complex. A power plant, factory, supercomputer all rolled into one kick-ass body. And our energy use was limited by how much we could eat and how much we could move: a few thousand calories a day. Then, big breakthrough: we domesticated animals, using them as batteries, essentially storing energy for us. Now, we\'re commanding energy outside our bodies. Then comes the water wheel, the windmill, we invent the steam engine, we\'re burning coal, and by 1900, not that long ago, we\'re here, using about 12,000 calories a day per person. Then we built the modern electric grid, the world\'s largest machine, we figure out nuclear power, we\'ve got the ability to send humans to the freaking moon, finally the digital revolution, those giant data servers off in the desert, and boom: here we are in 2016, where each American uses the equivalent of 208,000 calories a day. Seriously. It\'s like we\'ve each got a 100-person battalion at our disposal. It\'s on the order of the energy in a lightning bolt. We\'re all Zeuses! And most of this change happened in barely more than a century. So, as we turned into Zeuses, how did our relationship change? Well, I can tell you exactly what it felt like in the pre-Zeus era. No, I\'m not a time traveler, but I do run ultramarathons. Last month, I- woo, yeah! I ran a hundred mile race in the mountains of Idaho, up and down mountains, over scree, through mud. (Applause) Thank you! (Applause) (Cheers) For almost 29 hours, burning 15,000 calories, give or take. And during that ordeal, energy and me, we were super tight. I had my caloric intake planned out to the minute, and I was constantly checking in. Eat this gel now, back off the pace, drink more water, go hard down that hill, no, not that hard, now you\'re getting bloated, and oh! There comes the vomit!  (Laughter) You can only ramp up a human power plant so much before it breaks down. And to avoid that, I had to be intimately connected with my energy. I imagine maybe that\'s what it was like to be a human, hundreds of years ago. But now, as our energy use skyrocketed, we grew less aware of it. We stopped constantly checking in, and we began to blindly trust our energy. We went from using things we could see and touch, to using machines operating hundreds of miles away. Say you want to make a peanut butter banana smoothie and you turn on a blender. That blender is connected to the outlet, the substation down the street, the transmission lines; it\'s an uninterrupted chain all the way back to a power plant. And when you hit blend, a generator in that power plant spins slightly faster or slower to accommodate you. For real! But you don\'t see that, right? You just see the smoothie. That invisible system, it\'s like magic. You trust that it\'ll work. Over the past century, we left that close, instinctual energy awareness behind, and we began to blindly trust our energy. And as we did, we took that relationship for granted. And that\'s how energy became our insignificant other. So, implications... Well, as we grew to think about our energy systems less, we also grew to depend on them more. And that dependency only shows itself when energy\'s gone, when the power goes out and you find yourself eating a cold can of beans for dinner. Now here\'s what\'s dangerous: not just that our energy appetites have grown, but that most of us don\'t realize how much they\'ve grown, or what our energy appetites even are, so that when we need to tackle challenges involving our energy, we\'re so disengaged, we\'ve got no idea where to start. When I was running that hundred mile race, I hit some energy complications. Remember the vomit? But, I was able to handle them because I was dialed in to my energy. In any relationship, problems will pop up. With energy, these involve climate change,  the economy, geopolitics, energy poverty. The crux of a good relationship is being able to face problems, together. But when it comes to our energy, how can we face problems if we\'re not even on speaking terms? There are all kinds of technological fixes out there, but they\'ll be rendered useless if we can\'t change the relationship. Relax, take a breath. I\'m not going to leave you with bleakness. As your energy relationship counselor, I\'ve got some practical advice, but as I said, this is a new role for me, so I consulted the WikiHow illustrated guide on how to fix a relationship in four easy steps. Because of course that exists, right? Okay. Step one: understand the problem. Well, just by being here, you\'ve got a great start. With energy, a key problem is that we\'ve grown habituated to having such a fabulous, reliable partner, a partner we took for granted, so we stopped checking in. Which brings us to step two: learn to discuss better. (Laughter) There\'s no need to bottle up those energy questions. It\'s okay to ask, ""Are we still burning coal?"" or ""Can I put a wind turbine on my house?"" And you can practice some listening skills too. Maybe next month actually read your utility bill, the one you\'ve got setup on auto-pay. (Laughter) It\'s okay, I do too. So, communication, it takes two sides, and that poor communication we\'re accustomed to, it\'s not actually your fault. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to have a real discussion with your energy even in your own home. Utilities track every bit of electricity from a power plant to your house, but your house itself is a black box. There\'s no itemized list on that bill you get, so how much goes to your computer, your lights, or poof! just dissipated as lost heat, who knows? That\'s changing. Advancements like smart meters and smart appliances, these let us peek inside the black box. But, information alone will not repair our broken relationship, so step three: you\'ve got to reconnect. Things like holding hands and gazing into each others\' eyes, these can go a long way toward rekindling the flame. Let\'s be real, energy is not the only relationship in our lives so those ways to reconnect need to be simple, and they can\'t add to our information overload. Here\'s a fun one I\'ve been trying: going back to those 208,000 calories a day we each consume, pick an activity, say, binge-watching the latest season of Orange is the New Black. And now think, if I had to eat the amount of calories that matched the energy my TV uses, it would be a nice big slice of chocolate cake, and that\'s not even counting those data servers off in the desert. So, you don\'t need cutting edge technology to reconnect, you just need a creative, open mind. Slipping on your energy goggles and starting to see those connections out in the world, it will change your relationship. So, we\'ve understood the problem, we\'re discussing better, we\'re practicing that connection. Now we\'re ready for step four: figuring out how to move forward. I\'m really excited for the future. Our relationship with energy is changing on a personal level and a societal one too. The 20th century grid was designed to be magic and invisible, to keep energy at a distance. But innovations happening now can bring you back into the relationship. Things like electricity prices that change dynamically, the ability to generate and store power in your own home, detailed data on our energy behavior, these things can drastically reduce our energy use and costs, but getting them right requires us all taking a more active role in our relationship. You don\'t have to be like me running a hundred mile race and constantly obsessing over your energy. But you can check in every once and a while. Because when we treat energy as a significant other, a true partner, instead of just seeing energy problems, we\'re able to see energy solutions. Thank you! (Applause) (Cheers)'}",

I\'m here to talk about dogs, but more specifically, I\'m here to talk about bad dogs, and why I love them. I\'m a conservation biologist, meaning I study weird species and try to count them. And I\'m also a trainer of detection dogs, and where those two worlds meet is where I live, and where I work. Most of the dogs that we get for this kind of work, we scour shelters for because these are bad dogs, and they don\'t make great pets. And you know these dogs. You go to your friend\'s barbecue, and that dog comes up, and she is so happy to see you she pees on your feet, and she drops this big, slabbery ball in your lap, and you just throw it to try to get as much distance between yourself and this dog as possible, and it comes back, and then by 950th throw you\'re just thinking, ""Oh, just why didn\'t they get rid of this dog?"" And often they do. They end up in shelters because they often have this overwhelming desire to bring you things. (Laughter) They think that you\'re really enjoying this. The dog is so happy, thinking that you\'re all enjoying this game because you\'re throwing something and it\'s bringing it to you. And they\'re telling you where this thing is, and that\'s what we\'ve asked them to do over the evolution of time, our companionship with dogs, we\'ve asked them to bring us stuff. And they do a great job. They bring us our livestock, and they bring us food and game, and this is the only species on the planet that can be bothered to bring us stuff and bothered to tell us what they know. I mean you can ask a camel or a bear, or you can ask your cat, and you get nothing. (Laughter) But dogs love telling you what they know. And the ones that really really really love this, they are over the top, they have this unbelievable energy, just unrelenting go and drive. And we categorize that often as just a reject dog. It is just too much, it\'s destructive, it\'s all of these things. But those are the characteristics I like to work with in dogs. Inability to quit: it\'s not even a desire, it\'s an inability to quit, It\'s what resilience is. For a dog that doesn\'t stop, you can train that dog to do lots of things and bring you information. I\'d like to tell you a little bit about this particular dog, his name is Ruger. And he\'s a really bad dog. He is the first anti-poaching dog in Zambia, lives right next to a national park where animals are being poached and snared and trafficked out of the park, and even, you know, elephant ivory from the Congo Basin is moving through Tanzania and through Zambia out to ports to be shipped abroad. And this dog is trained to find ivory and rhino horn, bush meat, other wild life contraband and guns and ammunition. I trained him, and I found him to be a horrible dog. He bit and snapped at people, he was scary to approach, he was everything you fear in a dog, and it turns out he was going blind. So I take this dog to Zambia, and I pair him with these scouts who don\'t have any history of having pets or being with dogs except throwing rocks at village dogs. And they learned to think of this dog as a colleague. And after four months of intensive training with dogs, they started setting up roadblocks and looking for illegal contraband being trafficked in vehicles along the roads outside this park. And they checked vehicles, and by a human doing it, it can take hours, especially for a bus loaded with luggage and food, like this one up in the top corner. And Ruger just checked it in a few minutes as this is their first practice training on a roadblock. And he alerted, which means he sat, and he stared at his handler, and the handler was like, ""Oh, dear!"" They searched it, looked through it, and they found nothing, and so their spirits dropped. But they unloaded that minivan, and they have luggage out, and again Ruger picked a piece of luggage and he sat, and they searched through it and found nothing. And Ruger insisted, and they went back, and then Ruger hit on a tiny matchbox wrapped in a plastic bag inside clothes. And inside that matchbox was a primer cap, which is an illegal firing pin for a handmade rifle. And so everyone, all the passengers on that bus, all the scouts, they suddenly believed. They believed that Ruger knew what he was doing because he didn\'t quit. He has an even more interesting backstory.  He came off of an Indian reservation, the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. And he was a horrible puppy, and the owner of this litter shot all of the dogs. Somehow Ruger escaped, he ended up in a shelter in Helena. Someone found him and noticed how bad he was and brought him to us to be trained as a conservation detection dog. He has made a huge difference. Because of his unrelenting energy and desire to work and love of work, he brings us amazing information. Then there is another dog I\'d like you to meet. His name is Pepin, and he is with our executive, Dr. Pete Coppolillo, who is going to tell you a little bit more, and I\'m going to work Pepin for you. PC: Well, Megan, Pepin get ready. I\'ll give you a little update on Ruger. The four months after he made his first find in the minibus, he detected and the scouts he works with confiscated 15 guns. Mostly homemade muzzleloaders, which are their gun of preference for elephant poaching. They\'re also used because guns are hard to come by in Africa, by sometimes seven, sometimes 10, sometimes more different poachers. So, as of now, there may be 100-150 different poachers who are out of business thanks to Ruger. (Applause) (Cheers) And for these exceptional, really high-drive dogs, you know, Ruger is really the rule rather than the exception. And I\'ll tell you about a couple more. This is Seamus. Seamus is trained to detect dyer’s woad, which is the weed that\'s in that pot there. And speaking of resilience, dyer’s woad drops between 12,000 and 15,000 seeds a year. So it\'s a noxious weed,  and when it gets established, it\'s very hard to get rid of. So people were working on getting rid of it on Mount Sentinel in Missoula for about 10 years, and they weren\'t making any progress. So in 2011, we brought in Seamus. And Seamus is able to do something that we human searchers can\'t, which is find it by smell before it flowers. Seamus has knocked back dyer’s woad by over 95 percent.  Thanks to him, we\'re going to do something that was unthinkable just a few years ago, which is eradicate a noxious weed, a bad infestation of a noxious weed. And this is Wicket. Wicket is one of the best stories. She was in a shelter in Anaconda, Montana, and when we came to get her, the director of the shelter said, ""You don\'t want that dog. That dog is crazy."" (Laughter) And now Aimee famously said, ""I think she might be the right kind of crazy."" Wicket is now the most accomplished conservation detection dog in the world. She\'s worked on three continents, she\'s worked in dozens of US states, and here she is searching a boat for zebra mussels which have a microscopic larval stage that we can\'t see. Speaking of accomplished and crazy, (Laughter) now you guys will get to watch Pepin do his thing. So Meg\'s put his vest on. That is his signal that it\'s time to work. You can see he\'s low-focused. (Laughter) He is ready to go. So I hid ivory. I hid some ivory in the room. Pepin is one of the ivory dogs, and I hid some ivory in the room. You, guys, just stay put. He\'s also not trained on narcotics, so no one has to make a run, (Laughter) for the door or anything like that, and when Meg tells him to go, he\'ll do his thing. So what you\'re going to see is you\'re going to see him work, and you can watch his head, he\'ll move his head up and down, it\'s a little hard indoors because there\'s not much air moving around in here. But he\'ll search, and you may see him whip around, change directions, his alert is something we call ""passive alert."" He sits. And the reason he does that is because we have him trained not to disturb the samples. Sometimes it\'s a crime scene, so they want to collect evidence. Sometimes we collect scats for DNA or things like that. Normally, he works in big open places. He is trained on grizzly bear, he is trained on wolverine, so he runs on big, high meadows and pastures, but he\'s also trained on containers, vehicles and buildings. And he\'s checking there. You see he\'s got scent now. There he goes. Good job, pal! That\'s his alert. And she has a command that is, ""Show me!"" And he\'ll show where it is. So that\'s a broken ivory tusk. (Applause) Well done. Thank you! (Applause)'}",

Alongside videos of Bailey providing emotional support to the patients at a Yokohama children's clinic, Morita makes the case for bringing dogs (and their healthcare professional handlers) into hospitals everywhere.",,42361,2019-04-05T21:43:28+00:00,"['health', 'animals', 'emotions', 'healthcare', 'humanity']","['English', '日本語']",Yuko Morita,,"{'0:00': ""The second bond is: between a facility dog and their hander, who live together twenty-four seven. We always spend holidays together too. This is very important; just getting together while working and saying 'Bye-Bye' after five doesn't make any sense. We sleep at night and Bailey sleeps with his head on my arm. The bond between a facility dog and their handler is the basis on which a facility dog works professionally. Only the bond with me can convince Bailey to trust me to work together. But the truth is; you may think that a training dog will do anything I say, Bailey is a stubborn guy who goes only where he wants. To a direction he doesn't to want to go, he does like this. Can you see he is hanging on with all his might? Planting his feet firmly on the ground, digging his nails into it, he never goes where he doesn't want to. While walking on the street, I sometimes struggle with Bailey sitting there. People passing by always say laughing, 'That's troublesome'. But he has never refused to go to the hospital. On the contrary, he sometimes refuses to go home, squatting there, going back into the hospital ward. Dogs easily understand what people are thinking about them. Because there are many people who love him, Bailey loves the hospital very much. Both a dog and people are mutually affected; that is where the facility dog belongs. This is why non-sentient toy dogs cannot make this happen. A robot dog can not make this happen. The third bond is between Bailey and the medical staff. The handler of a facility dog is a medical staff. The reason why only medical staff can be a handler of a facility dog is: that a facility dog's work includes not only healing mentally, but also curing physically. Bailey and I sometimes take a part in the conversations where treatment courses of patients are decided. I also figure out how our patient kids are and work out how to approach this patient. I also write on the medical charts. In this way, to be involved with specific purpose is what only facility dogs are capable of, and why a handler of a facility dog must be certified medical staff. It has been five years since Bailey and I started working in Japan. We have met thousands of children. We once met a kid in the terminal phase of disease and the kid could not eat. He wanted to but he couldn't eat; that was his situation. Given a short span of time, both his family and nurses wished that he could enjoy whatever little amount of food he could. Then there was a suggestion made Bailey attended at his dinner table. With Bailey, the kid was happy to sit up smiling. Saying, 'Bailey, look at me', though it was only a few mouthful, but he could managed to grab spaghetti into his mouth. He could also enjoy ice cream, not being forced to do so, but willingly to do so. Only the presence of Bailey bedside could make that level of change. The bad impression of a hospital changed so much as to make children say, 'I want to be hospitalised to see Bailey'. With Bailey, kids can double their fun. With Bailey, kids can share tears and fears. Most children are discharged from hospital safe and sound. But sadly, some kids have to leave this world forever, and Bailey sometimes sleeps with them till just before their last moments. We say 'You know, Bailey's with you', 'It's warm, isn't?' to kids. The time goes on sadly but warmly. We sometimes attend a funeral for children. When parents have to close the lid of their own child's coffin, can you imagine how they feel? In fact every family says 'We were really happy to have Bailey with us'. They always say that. 'Before Bailey, the hospital stay had been just so heart-wrenching'. 'With Bailey our kid's life changed so much'. These are what bereaved families said to us. A family who lost their child will reflect on their child everyday, through their long span of life. Remembering their child as 'a poor soul who went through so many painful operations; or remembering their child as 'a laughing kid sleeping with Bailey just before death; their feelings are completely different, aren't they? We wish to make a small portion of happiness in their heartbreaking memory. We wish the bereaved family remember as many smiles of their kid as possible. The Facility Dog Programme is not an option, but necessity for hospital care, that's what I strongly feel about it. Japan's medical care is said to be the highest in the world. Not just curing disease, but also having an environment for healing disease more proactively is necessary, I think. For patients, they can't have too much fun. There are a lot of facility dogs in Europe and the US, but in Japan we have only two. I would like to have facility dogs as a standard in Japanese hospitals and make Japanese hospitals a fun place to be in, even for patients who have medical conditions. So many children who passed away are watching for us from heaven. For those kids, I would like to make the Japanese medical front a place where I can be proud to say, 'Hey, it's a good hospital, isn't it?' (Applause)""}",

I started playing when I was 12 years old. It has been a dominant presence in my life ever since. From youth football, to high-school, and college, and now as a coach. Football has played a huge role in shaping me as a person. Recently, I achieved my dream job of becoming varsity line coach at my high-school alma mater. Last March I was at a coaching clinic. It was late in the afternoon and I was tired. These coaching clinics can tend to be a bit of a drag at times. Hours and hours, and days and days of the presentations on the x\'s and o\'s of football. There was one presentation, though, that looked interesting. It was titled ""Disneyland."" This presentation changed my life. This talk was not about the x\'s and o\'s of football. But rather about the emotional truth of why we coaches coach. We are coaches so that we can have a meaningful impact on young people\'s lives, and help them become better people. As coaches, we want to have the kind of impact that assure that one day our players can hold hands with their children and walk into Disneyland. The moral of this incredible message was this: as coaches, we can preach to our players that it is more important for them be better people than it is great football players. But if we are not honest with them and do not practice what we preach, it will never work. In other words, teenagers are adept at sensing bullshit. (Laughter) As coaches, we must be willing to share our truth. And sharing our truth is the only way we can have the kind of impact we truly want to have. The coach who gave this presentation, his truth was that his son became a drug addict due to the bullying and pressure he was subjected to from his dad being the head football coach at his school in Eagle, Idaho, a program that at the time was not very succesful. I went from a presentation on how to run the power against a 3-4 defense to the most honest, emotional and inspirational talks on coaching philosophy I\'d ever heard. So it got me thinking. What\'s my bullshit? What is unique about me that I bring to the table that will have a meaningful impact? What is my truth? My truth is this. I\'m a former college football player. I\'m a current high-school football coach. And I am gay. I battled with this truth for a long time. Personally, professionally and certainly in my coaching and athletic career. It was an identity crisis that had a tremendous impact on my life. Long before I heard this presentation on Disneyland I thought about coming out in football. In the beginning, I told myself ""You\'re gay and you will take it to the grave."" Now, I\'ve come a long way since that day. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you. I\'ve come a long way since that day, but the process almost cost me my life. I chose to come out to family and friends starting in August of 2014. I told my immediate family first, and then I carefully picked my way through family and friends, trying to choose the right time and place. Only being part way out of the closet meant that I had to be two different people and always be very aware of where I was and whom I was with. It caused a constant state of panic and anxiety. So the question became, ""Is it important for me to come out publicly?"" Yes it is, and here is why. My time in-and-out of the closet helped my realize that there are other people in my situation. And it is not a pretty one. It also helped me realize that coming out is not about sharing my bedroom habits, but about giving myself permission to live my life in its entirety. Let me explain. After talking to one of my fellow coaches, he told me:  ""I don\'t talk about my sex life with players, why would you?"" And it\'s a legitimate question, but a common misconception about coming out. Again, I\'m not talking about my sex life. I\'m talking about my life. It\'s often said that your private life is your private life. But imagine you are put in a situation where going virtually anywhere and doing very normal, healthy, human activities with your significant other could have substantial consequences on your life, reputation and career. You gain a very new perspective on what your private life actually is. That\'s how being in the closet affected my life. It was quite literally a closet. No space, no freedom and no comfort. It\'s a suffocating lifestyle with measurable effects. It wore me down until eventually I was abusing alcohol and prescription medications to keep my anxiety in check. It was a horrible time in my life. When you are put in a situation of having to live a double life, it strips you off dignity and normal coping mechanisms. At that time the only place I felt somewhat safe was at home. I was living with my parents, who had been nothing but supportive, but I did not feel comfortable bringing guys around them yet. So there I was. No safe place, no place to be myself,  facing a new lifestyle I did not know how to navigate, the anxiety and depression were inescapable. And I responded the only way I felt I could at the time. Drugs and alcohol. Football teaches so many great life lessons to those who play or coach. Perseverance, toughness, respect, self-esteem. But the one negative thing that it does teach is that being gay is not OK. To be frank, the word ""faggot"" is used almost as much as the word ""football."" There is a misconception about the prominence of gay men in football, and it has serious consequences. I\'m the perfect example of this issue. An all-state player in high-school. A two-year varsity captain among a select few in school history to go play for a top tier division 1 football program. The youngest line coach in the history of the school. And I was ready to kill myself. Because I thought that even though this program was like a second family to me, I feared they would shun me. It was a crushing weight that I was carrying with me all the time. Months and months of sleep deprivation, severe anxiety and depression. And honestly, a lack of the will to live began to catch up with me. It was too much. I was desperate for a way out. Any way out. One night I reached for a bottle of vodka and a couple of pills. I didn\'t see a way out. I just wanted it to be over. If I couldn\'t be me and still live my life, what was the point? I passed out on the bathroom floor, and my mom found me. I was fortunate to wake up the next day. I escaped an overdose. It was the scariest moment of my life. When I woke up the next day, I knew I really wasn\'t ready to give up. And when I heard that talk on Disneyland, I knew how, when and why it was important for me to share my story. I worried for so long about how the football community would react. And while at this point only time will tell, my experience has given me a theory. It\'s simple. One day, being gay in football will be normal. But in order for that to happen, those of us who are gay need to stand up and own it. The coaches I know are perfect examples of this. I have been met with nothing but love and support from my fellow coaching friends. But now the challenge is to change this. And not just on the private level. The odds of a gay teen or young adult abusing drugs, alcohol, or experiencing anxiety, depression, or even attempting suicide are drastically high. When it comes to football, the social norm that we\'ve created leaves many without hope. We\'ve made incredible progress  in the equal rights movement under the law. But now we must tackle a different problem. Social equality and the message we send to young people who play football. Continue to use sports to inspire, connect and to share a positive message. A healthy person cannot live life in the dark. And if you are out there, stand up and own it. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

Nomad. Empath.,"{'0:00': 'In case there\'s any confusion, that\'s me up there. (Laughter) Enjoying the spotlight or commanding attention does not come naturally to me. Blending into the background, analyzing and observing a situation, is where I find the most comfort, or, as I\'ll get to later on in this talk, when I\'m on the road by myself. Unless this lady is with me. Yes, I\'m referring to my camera as a lady. (Laughter) She is my safety blanket, and I\'ve spent more time with my camera than with most people in my life. I\'m an artist, I am a photographer, I\'m a self-described nomadic creator. It\'s one of those creative professions that when you tell people, they say, ""Wow, I wish I could do that!"" Or, ""What do you really do for work?"" (Laughter) Or my personal favorite, ""Did you go to school for this?"" (Laughter) And, as with most things that we don\'t have personal experience with, we make our own assumptions and judgments based off of the only tangible things that we can grab from. So, when you say ""photographer,"" people often think ""weddings,"" or ""high school portraits,"" or the ridiculous way photographers are depicted in TV and movies. And I am going to show you what I do and why I do it. Now, when people first meet me or hear about me, this is what they\'re interested in. Now, I could stand here and I can talk about how I\'ve brushed shoulders with world leaders, and my surreal five minutes that I spent with President Obama. Or I could talk about photographing Hillary Clinton a week before the election, after a rally in North Carolina. Or the tremendous emotional weight for myself photographing Darren Wilson a year after the events in Ferguson, Missouri, for the New Yorker, to then, only a year later, photograph Bryan Stevenson, and he is an advocate and a lawyer based out of Mobile, Alabama, who fights for the under-represented, and we had a conversation about race that still stays with me today. Or just what\'s the easiest and what most people can relate to: celebrity. So, I could talk about Agelina Jolie, or I could talk about the TV icon that\'s Sarah Jessica Parker, or I can just talk about the numerous actors and musicians and notable people that I\'ve interacted with over the last decade. And I love my job and I love my work, but that\'s not what I\'m here to talk to you about. I\'m going to talk about when I\'m in my 2003 Buick, driving cross-country for weeks at a time, and how that\'s when I\'m feeling the most fulfilled. But first, I need to give a little backstory on me and why I do what I do. So, think of it like in an abridged episode of ""This American Life,"" just not that long. (Laughter) So, I am a white, cis, queer man from a working-class family in New York, and with all things being relative, I didn\'t grow up with the utmost privilege, and it wasn\'t uniquely terrible either. My parents, however, were too involved with their own demons for me to ever truly feel seen or heard. And it wasn\'t necessarily their fault. It was merely just a casualty of their reality. Depression, addiction, anger, resentment overwhelmed both of them. When I was seven, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. It was the first of a decade-long battle that she ended up surviving from. It was also the same time that she showed me how to make her a screwdriver. When I was ten, I knew that I was queer, or that I at least liked boys, and by 13, my mother outed me. It was an experience that let me feeling like my identity was stripped from me. By 14, my dad had a DUI or two, I don\'t really remember. By 16, he moved out of the house, and by 18, I didn\'t really speak to either of them. So, my world up until this point made me feel that my experiences and my feelings would never actually compare to that of my parents. And intellectually, I knew better, but I didn\'t actually know what would make me feel differently. All I knew was that I didn\'t want anyone that came into my life to ever feel like they were not seen. And then, I picked up a camera. For me, photography was always really interesting because of the immediacy and collaborative nature of it. It would be a way for me to meet people that were outside of the safe mental bubble that I had created for myself. And so, I started photographing, and as I started interacting with other people, I realized that the interaction itself was actually more interesting to me than the photograph. When I started realizing that, and I thought about my dad, who had recently got sober, I wanted him to feel seen. So, at this point, he and I were still very estranged, and I was in graduate school and my professor, Collier Schorr, said something to me that still echoes in my head pretty much every day: my work was ""too easy,"" and just because I could make something that ""looked good"" did not mean that it was interesting. And so, I needed to challenge myself and my craft. Ironically enough, after years of spending my time making myself feel comfortable, I needed to be uncomfortable again. So, I asked my dad if he would be willing to sit for a portrait. This was the first one that I took of him. Then, I took a break because I needed to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out what it was that I actually wanted to do with him. And so, I continued to photograph him and we started to have a dialogue, but it was through photographs. And I even actually started taking portraits of myself with him because I wanted to, at first, just have a close physical proximity to him. And the idea of this made me realize I needed full immersion, I needed no easy escape plan. And so, I asked him, kind of not even thinking it would happen, if he would go on the road trip that we never took when I was a kid, and surprisingly, he said, ""Yeah, sure, let\'s do it."" And so, he and I hit the road, and as this happened, we started creating this fantasy relationship that never actually existed. (Laughter) But the experience of making these photographs created a bond between the two of us that we were incapable of doing otherwise. It was my a-ha moment for photography. I was using my camera as a therapist. It became this third party that allowed the two of us to communicate with each other even when we weren\'t actually talking. We finally actually saw each other. So, fast-forward about a decade later, and I am no longer working with my dad, but I am photographing strangers spontaneously that I meet on the road. Now, about a month before the election, I was having tremendous anxiety and feeling very stagnant about my work in general. I began seeing friends withdraw and the overall feeling of frustration on social media. And to be quite honest, I just wanted to escape. And so, I hit the road, and I didn\'t have any destinations in mind. I just knew I wanted to drive cross-country and I wanted to escape. And then, about a day into being on the road, I realized I needed to be doing something while I was on the road, because being just with yourself can lead to a lot, a lot of soul-searching. So, once I realized I wanted to be doing something, I thought back to the time with my dad and how pivotal and also very cathartic it was for me, for my craft and also my mental health. And so, I wanted to do that with strangers, and I went on Instagram, I went on Facebook, I downloaded all of the dating and hook-up apps, and I started messaging everyone that I could within every town that I stopped in. Now, when a stranger approaches you online, it leads to a little hesitation. And I say ""stranger"" and I just want to let you know I\'m utilizing a community that is already comfortable for me, and that\'s of gay or queer-identifying men. And so, I would send messages with a brief little description of what I was doing. I wanted to come and meet you, I wanted to come to your home, we could meet in public, and I wanted to take your portrait - I got the majority of [them] being noes, and a lot of variations of, ""That\'s creepy"" or - (Laughter) ""I don\'t really photograph well."" But there was something that did come up pretty often, and it was, ""Why me?"" And it was that other a-ha moment for me. There didn\'t need to be a ""why me."" I wanted everyone that I interacted with to not only feel special, but to also feel like their stories could be heard. So, this body of work, it\'s called ""The Day of The Lone Wolf,"" and it\'s from a book called ""The Secret [Language] of Birthdays,"" and it happens to be the day that I was born on. Now, I casually mentioned my mother earlier, and it was by no accident. Her and I are still estranged, but I wanted to take this moment to thank her. When I was younger, she read to me from The Secret Language of Birthdays, and she used the personality traits that were depicted for The Day of The Lone Wolf, both to criticize and also occasionally appraise me, such as emotionally ""sensitive,"" and ""impulsive,"" and ""contradictory."" Now in my mid 30\'s I\'ve reclaimed my identity as a queer man and I\'ve also reclaimed The Day of The Lone Wolf, and I\'m creating in honor of it. So, since that first road trip, I\'ve gotten cross-country two more times, and the only thing that you actually know about these photographs is the common denominator is me. Now, everyone has a story, you\'ve been listening to mine - And so, while you may not know the particulars of their struggles or of their achievements or even of their privilege, there is one thing that you do know: they allowed themselves to be vulnerable with a stranger, and that\'s what I\'ve done with you today. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

My siblings and I were waiting for our mom to come back from the hospital, where my grandmother was having surgery for advanced cancer. Finally, the doors opened, and my mom said, ""She didn\'t survive the operation."" She burst into tears and between sobs, said, ""Your grandmother\'s last wish was to be buried in her home, in Korea.""', '00:47': 'I was only 12 when this happened, and when I recovered from the initial shock, my mom\'s words echoed in my ears: Grandma wanted to be buried in her ""home."" We had emigrated from Korea to Argentina six years earlier. We knew no Spanish, or how we were going to make a living. We were immigrants in a new land, where we had lost everything on account of a scam, and we had worked very hard to rebuild our lives. That\'s why I couldn\'t imagine that after so many years, our home would still be Korea. It made me wonder: Where do I want to be buried someday? Where is my home? To be honest, I didn\'t have an answer to these questions, and that really worried me.', '01:50': 'This episode triggered an existential search for my identity. I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi, and I grew up in Argentina, where there was always meat on the table; truly, it would not be surprising if today I were 80 percent cow.', '02:09': '(Laughter)', '02:10': 'I was educated in the United States, where I became addicted to peanut butter. During childhood, I honestly felt very Argentine, but my appearance always gave me away.', '02:23': 'I remember the first day of high school, my literature teacher entered the classroom, carefully looked at everyone, stopped in front of me and prophesized: ""You won\'t pass this class unless you get a private tutor."" But by then, I was speaking perfect Spanish -- better than I speak it now, I think, because it\'s been years since I left. And I felt forced to choose between my Argentine identity and my Korean one. Apparently, I couldn\'t be both, and I had to abandon my previous identity in order to adopt the new one.', '03:03': ""So when I turned 18, I went to Korea to see if I could find this home that I could call my place in the world. In Korea, people assumed I was a foreigner, and they'd ask me, “Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent?”"", '03:19': '(Laughter)', '03:21': ""Apparently, I was too Korean to be Argentine, but too Argentine to be Korean. Realizing that, honestly, was very transformative. I decided not to try and change what I can't change and accept it. In fact, I was inspired by one of my grandmother's stories."", '03:42': 'My grandmother never learned Spanish, but she was very independent and managed on her own. She would walk all around the streets of Buenos Aires, even in the most dangerous areas. One afternoon, she was attacked and threatened at gunpoint. They put the gun to her head and said, ""The ring! The ring! Give me your ring!"" They wanted her gold ring, which was her most prized possession back then. Well, my grandmother looked the criminal in the eyes, sat down on the sidewalk, and a peaceful smile came onto her face. My grandmother thought they were saying ""anyó"" instead of ""ring,"" which in Korean, means ""sit down.""', '04:25': '(Laughter)', '04:26': 'She thought, ""Well, it\'s the last day of my life, so if I\'m leaving, let\'s leave with a smile."" She gracefully accepted her fate. Imagine the face of her attacker -- he must have thought my poor grandmother was a creature from another planet, and he took off running, bewildered.', '04:47': ""That experience inspired me to accept my new reality with optimism. I hadn't managed to find that place in the world that I could call home. But then I wondered: How many Koreans with Latino mannerisms that speak Korean with a Spanish accent are there in the world? Maybe it could be an advantage, a useful tool, a way to stand out in a world where things are changing very quickly, where qualities and abilities can sometimes become obsolete from one day to the next."", '05:28': ""So I decided not to focus on having 100 percent in common with people I met, Instead, I realized that I was frequently the only intersection between groups of people that didn't have much in common and that were even, at times, in conflict among themselves. So with this new perspective, I proudly accepted the different versions of myself and even, at times, allowed me to reinvent myself."", '06:02': 'For example, I have to confess that in high school I was what we call a bookworm -- I had thick glasses, had no fashion sense whatsoever. What\'s more, I think the only reason I had friends was because I let them copy my homework every morning. That\'s true. Once I went to college, I was able to find a new identity, and the ""worm"" became a popular girl. OK, granted, it was MIT, so I don\'t think the bar was very high -- (Laughter) but at least I could maintain that identity. I changed majors so many times that my advisor told me that instead of chemical engineering, I should get a degree in random studies.', '06:48': '(Laughter)', '06:50': 'Over the years, I\'ve had a lot of identities: academic, scientist, social innovator, inventor entrepreneur, investor; most recently, networker, teacher and, most importantly, a mother, three years ago. I was so confused that even my accent couldn\'t decide who it was. My friends would joke and say that it was of such an unknown origin that I was the only person in the world who spoke this language, ""Rebecanese.""', '07:24': 'Reinventing oneself can be hard. For example, when I was finishing my doctorate, I was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug. So suddenly, writing a 400-page thesis in an office in a basement seemed less appealing than starting my own company. So I had the job of telling this to my parents, who are traditional Asian immigrants -- whereas my siblings and I are the first to attend college -- in other words, that education is the most important thing in my family. You can imagine the reaction awaiting me upon telling my parents I was abandoning my studies. So I went to my parents, but with a secret weapon: a chart showing the average income of people who graduated with doctorates from Stanford compared to the average incomes of Stanford students who abandoned their thesis or doctorate. Now, I have to confess that the chart was really skewed by the founders of Google.', '08:30': '(Laughter)', '08:31': 'My mom looked at the chart and without blinking, said, ""I\'ve always said you should follow your heart.""', '08:39': '(Laughter)', '08:43': ""My search for identity these days isn't about finding my tribe. Really, it's about finding and accepting all the different possible permutations of myself. It's about cultivating diversity within myself, instead of just around me. Currently, my kids are three years old and six months old, just turned, and they were born into three nationalities and four languages -- and I need to clarify that I married a Danish guy, in case I didn't have enough cultural confusion in my life, I ended up marrying a Viking. I think my kids will be the only Vikings that won't be able to grow a beard when they grow up. It'll be hard for them."", '09:36': '(Laughter)', '09:37': ""I hope that my kids will have a multidimensionality that works for them; that they see it as a tool for creating connections in a world that's every day more global and also more divided. I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried that they don't fit into a predefined box, that they can feel free to experiment and take control of their life narratives in their own way. I hope they can use the unique combination of values, cultures, languages and abilities that they have to create a world where their identities are used to unite peoples and people, and not as an excuse to generate intolerance -- because identity can be a double-edged sword: we can use it to differentiate ourselves from others, or to find points of connection. And when we accept our multiplicity, we amplify this power of connection and forget about the differences a little."", '10:50': ""Now, back to my grandmother: her last wish was also her final life lesson for me. It turns out that after many years, I found out why she wanted to be buried in Korea. It wasn't a question of patriotism or nationality. She wanted to rest in peace next to her son, who had died many years before she emigrated to Argentina."", '11:18': ""My grandmother lived a life full of deep connections and indestructible ties, including those separated by distances or oceans or even death. She had many identities: matriarch, farmer, businesswoman, Korean, immigrant, mother, grandmother. With her last wish, she taught me that finding our home isn't about putting down roots somewhere. It's about intertwining those roots with the roots of others who enrich our lives."", '12:00': 'Thank you.', '12:01': '(Applause)'}",

Now, I want you to picture ancient Rome. What images come to mind? The gladiators, Colosseum, Julius Caesar? Or maybe armies wearing scale mail, perhaps a bit like this. Now, I want to change your focus to a modern-day oncology unit, specifically women who are undergoing radiotherapy breast cancer treatment. Can you see a connection? Now, there\'s nothing obvious; I can grant you that, but today I would like to talk to you about two of my major science projects, both of which were inspired by the past: scale mail and ancient Egyptian water clocks, to help solve two very different problems. I\'m 16 years old, and I love science and engineering, in case you hadn\'t guessed from the T-shirt. As a scientist, I am, along with so many others, constantly thinking about where we\'ll be in five years, in 10 years, even in 50 years\' time, the question which constantly drives our curiosity and our imagination to help solve global problems with simple answers. Whether this be clean energy or health, there are major concerns facing our planet today. Now, not only is our generation going to inherit these problems, but we\'re also creating new ones for ourselves. But I believe that when it comes to coming up with solutions, we can look to the past. We can use the past to change the future, taking things that have been used before and repurposing them in a different way. Now, if you\'ve ever gone to the dentist for an X-ray, you\'ll be familiar with this scene: the dentist comes into the room, they place a lead apron over the top of you whilst they quickly jump out, and you get your X-ray. Well, this is a similar type shield that might be used if you\'re undergoing radiotherapy breast cancer treatment, but it isn\'t failsafe. The lead that they use is toxic, it costs a lot of money, and it costs a lot of time for the centers, which is why they tend to opt out of this decision. However, this means that the women who are undergoing this treatment will receive harmful unwanted radiation to their contralateral breast, which is just a fancy word for the breast that\'s not being treated, and this is an unwanted byproduct of being free of cancer. Studies have shown that one in 14 women who undergo this treatment will develop a second primary cancer in this breast later in their lifetime, which is where my idea for scale mail comes in, something which I\'ve learned about in movies and museums. Could this ancient shielding technique be more effective than what we\'re using today? Now, some early forms of scale mail were documented by the Chinese, who used them to protect their horses during battle. The Japanese samurai used to beat individual leaves, replicating that of fish scales, [which] was also found in Roman and Persian armies and is also found on this very cute animal called the pangolin, which is very effective for protection. So this is my device called the SMART armor, which stands for ""Scale Mail Armor for Radiation Therapy."" So I made this by meticulously and painfully interweaving these individual scales together, using pliers and jump rings for what felt like an eternity. So, to test my device, I used what we would consider a typical breast cancer treatment. And this was found that I could reduce doses to the contralateral breast by up to 80%, reducing the radiation levels to this breast by 80%. Now, what makes this device different, which you may have already noticed, is not only the use of scale mail, but also the use of copper. Now, I found that copper was 20% more effective at the skin level than lead, something that contradicts global standards that we should be using lead. Now, I\'ve performed all of my testing at the Chris O\'Brien Lifehouse, and I\'m overwhelmed and absolutely ecstatic at the response. It has approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, which means that it\'s ready for clinical use. I have a provisional patent on it, so don\'t go thinking you can steal it. And my paper is soon to be published in the Journal of Applied Medical Physics, which is based in North America. Now, there\'s still, of course, a lot of work to be done, but through experimentation, through curiosity, and a bit of imagination, this just shows how an ancient technology can be refocused for future scientific breakthrough. The ancient curving, conforming nature of this material made it ideal for its new purpose, potentially saving lives. Now, I\'d like to change your focus a bit to a problem where I\'ve also focused my thinking: solar panels, which are expensive to buy, difficult to install, and thus become almost impractical when helping to solve the developing world\'s great energy crisis. Many millions of dollars and thousands of researchers across the world are looking to improve solar panel efficiency by one or two percent. I discovered that I could improve a solar panel\'s power output by up to 72% through the combination of ancient technology and the modern solar panels. Now, on a different note for a second, 71% of our world is covered in water; 96.5% of this is found in the oceans. Now, of all of this water that covers our planet, only one percent is able to be drunk, and only one percent holds the basic properties needed to make it consumable. Now, I want you guys to remember this because this becomes important a little bit later. But for centuries, humans have used water to scientifically aid our existence. In 1500 BC, the ancient Egyptians created the first clock, which was a water clock where they used a water-dripping vessel which was calibrated against the movements of the Sun to tell the time. Now, interestingly enough, it was the most accurate time measurement until the 17th century, when the pendulum clock was invented. Water has also been used to further exemplify beauty and magnify what we know as beautiful and as nature. So my idea was to apply this ancient water-dropping technique to solar panels in order to make a solar panel mechanically track the Sun. It\'s called ""The Solar System."" Now, this water-drip system works by matching the water tanks on one side of the solar panel to the force and strength applied by a spring system on the other side. Now, this means that I\'m able to control the drip amount and slowly rotate the panel throughout the day, matching the path of the Sun. The Solar System could be an exciting tool for developing communities as it\'s able to provide both water and power by filtering the water once it comes out of this water-drip system. We can provide developing communities with a safe access, a safe reliable water source and power. A 72% increase in power output shows you how ancient technology can be refocused, and how we can bring the past into the future. When Thomas Edison was asked, ""How did it feel to fail countless times?"" he replied, ""I didn\'t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps."" Now, I know that I\'m going to fail, and I\'m going to be disappointed constantly, but when this happens, it just means that you need to get up, it means that you need to try harder, and it means that you need to try something different. We need to start experimenting with a childlike curiosity and imagination, which can be inspired by the past. And don\'t let anyone tell you that your age matters.

I get to live in two universes. When I go to bed, I don\'t know to which world my dreams will take me. And when I\'m underwater, I\'m weightless, I can move in three dimensions. I can spend all day staring into the blue or marveling at the extraordinary, beautiful, mysterious, sometimes fearsome creatures that live in the sea. To be a human underwater is a completely different sensory experience. But it also strikes fear into me, not me as a human, but me as the fish that I spend my life trying to understand. Because the ocean can be a place full of danger and full of seemingly impossible challenges. Let me give you the example of the perilous life cycle of a coral reef fish. So we\'re all familiar with the brightly colored beautiful fish that live on coral reefs - cities of life full of color. But each year, these fish produce eggs, and the eggs hatch into tiny, almost microscopic larvae, and they spend several weeks at sea developing, only the size of a grain of rice. And after about two or three weeks, they\'re competent, ready to return to a coral reef where hopefully, once they found the right reef, they can gradually mature and join their adult community. Now, this seems paradoxical: you live in the perfect environment, and yet you send your offspring out to sea. Why would that be so? I\'ve spent my life trying to understand some of the processes that make this life cycle possible. In particular, how to fish find a reef? You\'re out at sea, at the mercy of ocean currents. How on earth, if you\'re the size of a grain of rice, do you find home? How do you choose the right place to live? How do you find a hiding place? These are the challenges that I try to tackle with some of the research that I do. Now, how would you do it? If you were this tiny fish at sea, what what information would you want to try and make that life cycle possible? Well, we know that some fish are able to smell different components of their environment. Some fish are able to look at the position of the sun in the sky, even the way sunlight shines through the clouds, perhaps even use celestial nighttime visual cues. Some fish even have a magnetic sense. So is that enough information to get these fish home? Well certainly, one thing that they probably can\'t use is sound, right? 60 years ago, Jacques Cousteau brought into the living rooms of the world, for the first time, the wonder of our underwater world. He invented scuba, to be able to take cameras underwater and beam those images back to people around the world. It was a remarkable film in so many ways, except perhaps for the title. You see, Jacques Cousteau told us that the ocean was a silent world. But when we go into the ocean, we know that\'s not true. Without scuba, we hear whales singing. This is the love song of a humpback whale. And whales can communicate over tens of miles, sometimes hundreds of miles, as they interact with each other. When we look on a coral reef, we realize it\'s not just whales and dolphins making sound; the fish can speak too. Fish produce popping, grunting, whooping, trumpeting sounds, and they do this to warn each other of predators, to be able to call each other over when they find food, and sometimes, particularly around the breeding season, to try and really impress each other. And so they have some amazing songs within the world of fish. Here\'s some of the croaking sounds of sergeant majors, the whooping sound of an ambo-damselfish and the deep grunting love song, in this case of a cod. So fish use sound; it\'s essential to their lives. And it\'s not even just the fish. When we start looking at the invertebrates that live on the reef too, we realize that lobsters can play their antennae like a fiddler would play the violin, and snapping shrimp, that probably are no bigger than the size of your thumb, with a claw no bigger than the size of your thumbnail, are able to produce one of the loudest underwater explosions every time they open their claw and push a bubble forwards into the water which implodes with a flash of light and an enormous bang. And all together, that creates a crackling sound that gives coral reefs its soundscape. So 18 years ago, I asked a question which, at the time, almost everybody I was working with on the Great Barrier Reef thought was crazy: is it possible that fish could use sound as a way of finding their way home? Now, to ask that question, my first approach was to take light traps - light traps are bright boxes with clear glass windows which have slits in them, like letter boxes - and when you shine a bright light underwater on the edge of the reef, you can intercept the larval fish, the baby fish, as they come back to the reef. Many fish, like moths, are attracted to light, and we can catch them in our traps and we can count them as they return. But just to mix it up a little bit, I then hung underneath a trap a speaker. These are underwater speakers sold for synchronized-swimming teams to be able to keep beat underwater, but we use these speakers to playback recordings of coral reefs, to ask the question, ""Are fish, at this tiny early stage in their life, several weeks old, attracted to coral reef sound?"" And sure enough, three months later, putting these traps out night after night, we found that we caught more than twice as many fish in our noisy traps compared to the quiet ones. And then, to test whether this really was enough for a fish to choose where it wanted to make its home, we hung the speakers over small piles of dead coral rubble, artificial reefs that we built on the sand flats. And sure enough, the fish came swimming in when we were playing our sound. So sound is clearly a cue that these fish were using to hear their way home. So I\'ve spent the last 15 years listening to the ocean, trying to interpret what these fish can hear. What is it, what information is available that gives fish this sensory experience that encourages them home? Now, as a marine biologist, one of the privileges is getting to play with some very big, very expensive toys. And I\'m just going to share two of mine with you today. The first is the good ship Masifa, which we invented as a way of being able to sail a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, over the reefs so that we could start to understand the rich tapestry of sound that\'s made as you travel from different types of reef. And then the second one is my hydrosaur. This is a - you could see at the time that funding for marine bio acoustics was in its early stages. This is an inflatable dinosaur, but I was able to strap my microphone to this and leave it out overnight, and by doing that, we started to realize there were patterns in the soundscape. At dusk, all of the nocturnal fish, the predators, emerge from their caves, and they start calling to each other as they go looking for food. So we get a dusk chorus. And then at dawn, these fish disappear back into the reef but out come all the daytime fish, and they\'ve got to reestablish their territories, much like birds would do in a forest, and so we get a dawn chorus too. The reef is alive with noise, and that noise has patterns. And we\'ve explored this by combining recordings with underwater surveys. And with our underwater surveys, we realize that we can hear whether there are coral there. We can hear which species live there. We realize that the fish at sea are doing much what we would do if we were moving to a new city: we\'d perhaps get on the internet and do some research into different suburbs that we might want to live in. We think fish can do the same thing by listening to their environment and choosing where they want to live. We now know that reefs all sound different; they have signature sounds. Baby fish can select the best habitat for their kind by using sound. And amazingly, it turns out so can many other animals on coral reefs: crabs, lobsters, clams, oysters, even corals themselves. Here\'s a few places that we\'ve worked. This is Balicasag, which is a marine protected area in the Philippines. You can see it\'s full of life. It\'s highly protected, there\'s no fishing, and as a result, when we listen to it, it\'s a wonderful soundscape. You can hear the fish communicating, you can hear the snapping shrimp. Now sadly, if we go three bays around the corner to Bilang-Bilangan, we find a more typical Filipino reef. This is a reef that\'s been heavily overfished, so there are no herbivores to graze away at the algae, which now smothers the reef. You can even see craters from dynamite fishing, and when we listen to it ... you can just about hear it. So a tiny fish would have to pretty much swim into this reef before it found it. The next generation are not coming home. We are changing the soundtrack of the ocean through overfishing and poor environmental protection. Let\'s go somewhere better: to the Great Barrier Reef. This is, for marine biologists, the benchmark. This is where we go to see what coral reefs once were like, what coral reefs can be like with really effective management, highly protected marine reserves, long distances away from cities, from pollution, and as a result, beautiful bustling underwater cities full of life. You can hear the Great Barrier Reef; it\'s a wonderful thing. And we\'ve studied this for 15 years to make reference to the reefs around the world. At least, we have until three years ago, when tragedy struck. With painful predictability, we saw the water temperature starting to rise. Oceanographic conditions meant the water was staying in one location, and for three weeks, the Great Barrier Reef cooked. We saw the reef in front of our eyes dying. And when we go back to the Great Barrier Reef now, we see in the northern part, where we do our research, 80% of it is dead. When we listen to that reef, it\'s 75% quieter. The snapping shrimp have gone. The complexity, the diversity of the sound is missing; it\'s become an acoustic desert. And so we realize, with climate change, we are changing the soundtrack of the ocean. These, in some ways, are gradual changes - overfishing, poor management, climate change - but we also realize when we take our recordings on a day-to-day basis, we change the soundtrack of the ocean by driving motor boats around. Millions of motor boats every day drive around coral reef environments, with engines that rattle, with propellers that cavitate, creating bubbles which screech in the water as they burst. And we\'ve realized that their sound causes stress to all of the animals that experience it. And with stress comes poor decisions: the fish are no longer able to respond to predators, to be able to find food, to be able to court, to be able to successfully reproduce. This motorboat noise is a form of noise pollution that makes us realize we are changing the soundtrack of the ocean. Now, if this was the end of the talk, it would be a sorry tale, but as a scientist, I asked myself, ""What is my role? Why am I trying to do the science that I\'m doing? Is my duty simply to monitor, to measure, to assess how the world is changing and to report that? Or can we take that knowledge, and can we actually turn it into practical solutions?"" So here\'s the spiny chromis, wonderful fish, lives on the Great Barrier Reef in monogamous pairs, a male and female living together. They lay their eggs in the reef, and their eggs hatch, and unusually, they bring their young through those first few weeks on the reef, they protect them, and you can see their baby fish out here, the larvae of the spiny chromis. Now, if we monitor how well they do near to boating channels, we realize that that motorboat noise means the adults don\'t feed as well, they don\'t defend the larvae against predators in the same way, and the larvae fail to develop, less larvae make it through. So, is that a real tragic story of how with noise pollution we\'re affecting reproduction? Or could it be that actually, if we turn it on its head, we realize our comparison is what happens if the boats aren\'t there: we see more reproduction, we see better behavior in the adults, more feeding, more defense against predators. Could we be talking here about a story of acoustic protection? If we go to the Great Barrier Reef and we play those sad recordings of the current state of the Great Barrier Reef, the fish no longer arrive in the numbers that we would hope for. If we play the recordings of the Great Barrier Reef as it used to be, the fish still come. So here, are we talking about a story of the loss of a sensory cue that\'s essential to close the loop of the life cycle? Or could this be a story about the potential value of acoustic enrichment? This is something that my group now are actively pursuing around the world, and we\'re hugely excited that there are tools with acoustics that we\'re realizing might be part of the solution. So we realize it\'s our gift to change the soundtrack of the ocean in this generation, but to change it for the better, not the worse. With technology, we can improve the sound outputs of boat engines - modern engines are far quieter. With environmental protection, we can keep boats away from breeding grounds, from nursery grounds. We can give quiet nights to allow the fish to come in and settle. And with acoustic enrichment, we can potentially accelerate the recovery of habitats that have been worst hit. Thank you for listening. (Applause)'}",

These kids are so frightened, worried, literally physically uncomfortable due to their anxiety.

Do you still fix things for them at age eight, 10, 14?

All these situations involve risk: risk of not doing well, not getting what they want, risk of maybe making mistakes or being embarrassed.', '09:05': ""For kids with anxiety who don't take risks and engage, they then don't learn how to manage these types of situations. Right? Because skills develop with exposure over time, repeated exposure to everyday situations that kids encounter: self-soothing skills or the ability to calm oneself down when upset; problem-solving skills, including the ability to resolve conflicts with others; delay of gratification, or the ability to keep your efforts going despite the fact that you have to wait over time to see what happens. These and many other skills are developing in children who take risks and engage. And self-efficacy takes shape, which, simply put, is the belief in oneself that you can overcome challenging situations."", '10:04': ""For kids with anxiety who escape and avoid these situations and get other people to do them for them, they become more and more anxious with time while less confident in themselves. Contrary to their peers who don't suffer with anxiety, they come to believe that they are incapable of managing these situations. They think that they need someone, someone like their parents, to do things for them."", '10:36': 'Now, while the natural parenting instinct is to comfort and protect and reassure kids, in 1930, the psychiatrist Alfred Adler had already cautioned parents that we can love a child as much as we wish, but we must not make that child dependent. He advised parents to begin training kids from the very beginning to stand on their own two feet. He also cautioned that if children get the impression that their parents have nothing better to do than be at their beck and call, they would gain a false idea of love.', '11:17': ""For children with anxiety in this day and age, they are always calling their parents or texting distress calls at all hours of the day and night. So if children with anxiety don't learn the proper coping mechanisms when young, what happens to them when they grow up?"", '11:37': ""I run groups for parents of young adults with anxiety disorders. These youth are between the ages of 18 and 28. They are mostly living at home, dependent on their parents. Many of them may have attended school and college. Some have graduated. Almost all are not working, just staying at home and not doing much of anything. They don't have meaningful relationships with others, and they are very, very dependent on their parents to do all sort of things for them. Their parents still make their doctors appointments for them. They call the kids' old friends and beg them to come visit. They do the kids' laundry and cook for them. And they are in great conflict with their young adult, because the anxiety has flourished but the youth has not. These parents feel enormous guilt, but then resentment, and then more guilt."", '12:40': 'OK, how about some good news? If parents and key figures in a child\'s life can help the child, assist them to confront their fears and learn how to problem-solve, then it is more likely that the children are going to develop their own internal coping mechanisms for managing their anxiety. We teach parents now to be mindful in the moment and think about their reaction to their child\'s anxiety. We ask them, ""Look at the situation and ask, \'What is this situation at hand? How threatening is it to my child? And what do I ultimately want them to learn from it?\'""', '13:25': ""Now of course, we want parents to listen very carefully, because if a child is being bullied seriously or put in harm's way, we want parents to intervene, absolutely. But in typical, everyday anxiety-producing situations, parents can be most helpful to their child if they remain calm and matter-of-fact and warm, if they validate the child's feelings but then help the child, assist them in planning how the child is going to manage the situation. And then -- this is key -- to actually have the child deal with the situation themselves."", '14:03': ""Of course, it is heartbreaking to watch a child suffer, as my parents told me years later. When you see your child suffering but you think you could swoop in and save them from the pain of it, that's everything, right? That's what we want to do. But whether we are young or old, excessive anxiety leads us to overestimate risk and distress while underestimating our ability to cope. We know that repeated exposure to what we fear weakens anxiety, while building resources and resilience."", '14:44': ""My parents were on to something. Today's hyper-anxious youth are not being helped by overly protective parenting. Calmness and confidence are not just emotions. They are coping skills that parents and children can learn."", '15:04': 'Thank you.', '15:05': '(Applause)'}",

We repeat and/or believe what people tell us to believe - about others and about ourselves. So why not tell stories that are empowering and aspirational and challenge us to be better? (Applause) That is exactly what superhero stories do. The history of comics is about the misfit, the unlikely hero, the ability to create greatness where there was once doubt. The unassuming Peter Parker, the wallflower who\'s picked on and misunderstood, gets bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him extraordinary powers and extraordinary responsibilities. Yet his path is filled with villains who would doubt his determination, who would threaten those he loves, threaten his life choices. And yet Spider-Man, being the hero that he is, would always swing back, he\'d always beat the bad guy and he\'d always get the girl. Or girls, in Spider-Man\'s case. Lots of love drama there. For 75 years, Marvel has been telling the tale of the outcast behind the mask. It\'s through his flaws and desires that we connect with the heart of the character so that when he emerges as a hero, we have a real reason to champion him because we understand those struggles too, don\'t we? And we also want to move past them. Heroes make a choice to fight injustice, to protect the innocent, to put the balance back on the side of the good, no matter how much they sacrifice of themselves. They\'re willing to die for it because they\'ve chosen who they are. And they will defend it no matter what. So when that little girl sat rapt to attention, all those years ago at her television screen, watching the X-Men, it wasn\'t just because they had taken her on an astonishing adventure. It\'s because they told her that it was okay to be different. In fact, you had to fight for it. Because we all want to be heroes, don\'t we? And wouldn\'t it be amazing if heroes looked just like us? So why does a character like Kamala Khan resonate with so many people? Like the first African-American and Latino Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Kamala Khan is so much larger than just a pop-culture icon. She came together in response to that global subconscious desire for representation for those Muslim American, bacon-sniffing, short, nerdy girls like me and for anyone else, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, religion, who just feel like misfits themselves. In the actual Ms. Marvel series, Kamala Khan is just a girl trying to fit in. She\'s constantly negotiating, renegotiating who she is and all of the rules that come with it. Where does she belong? She has no idea. She\'s still figuring out that journey to her authentic self. But all she knows is that she does not want to be limited by the labels imposed upon her. So really, Kamala Khan\'s story is everyone\'s. It\'s about confronting the labels you\'ve been assigned and sculpting them and redefining them until you figure out who you truly are and what you actually believe. One of my favorite mottos - actually I have it written on a post-it over my computer. I look at it every single day, and it was said by a poet named Rumi. And it goes, ""Do not be satisfied with stories, that which has come before. Unfold your own myth."" And that is our challenge. Every single one of us, no matter the categories we\'ve inherited, we must unfold our own myth. And it won\'t be easy. We\'re constantly navigating, rearranging, reinventing others\' expectations of ourselves every day. But every word we write in the narrative of our own lives, we come closer to uncovering what\'s beneath our own masks, maybe even embracing that true misfit, that true crazy one within. Oh, it\'ll be a fight, that\'s for sure. But that battle for your soul, for your authentic self, it\'s worth it, isn\'t it? It\'s bold; it\'s brave. In fact, I would say it\'s heroic. So now it\'s your turn. Tell me your story. Thank you. (Applause)'}",

What if sharks -- creatures we see as a threat to life -- could help fix it? Microbiologist Ethan Mann explains how the unusual qualities of shark skin could lead to a new generation of medical devices that reduce bacterial infection.,,52034,2019-07-30T17:26:29+00:00,"['medical research', 'microbiology', 'technology', 'health', 'fish']","['English', 'Français', 'Galego', 'Italiano', 'Português brasileiro', 'Русский', '中文 (繁體)']",Ethan Mann,Microbiology Maverick,"{'0:00': 'The US Navy has always had this frustrating problem with their fleet. It\'s something called ""fouling."" Now, for all you non-seafaring folk, fouling is when things like algae and barnacles and other marine materials get stuck to the sides of ships and submarines. Used to be able to prevent this fouling by coating ships and submarines with toxic agents, like heavy metals, but these heavy metals aren\'t as effective at keeping ships clean as they used to be. And we want clean ships because fouling on these vessels actually makes them less efficient in the water and can be easier for enemies to detect. This is not good. So several years ago, the US Office of Naval Research called on one of my colleagues, engineer scientist Dr. Anthony Brennan, to devise a solution to prevent fouling without the use of these heavy metals. See, Dr. Brennan was already investigating how things like surface roughness can prevent the attachment of organisms like algae. But Dr. Brennan was struggling. All of the engineered surfaces he came up with algae eventually overcame. And then Brennan found himself at a conference in Hawaii, of all places, and noticed something rather intriguing. Take a look at these three animals: a manatee, a whale and a shark. What do you notice? Well, right. So the whale and the manatee are filthy, but the shark is squeaky clean. This is a property unique to all sharks. The next time you watch Shark Week, you\'ll notice each and every shark you see is pristine. (Laughter) Why? Brennan wanted to find out. So with the help of some brave graduate students, they set out to find a shark. (Laughter) They found one in the shallow water and carefully took a mold of its skin using a dental impression material. Don\'t worry. The shark wasn\'t harmed in the process, although I\'m sure he didn\'t appreciate it. (Laughter) So the students took the mold back to the lab and put it under a microscope, and this is what it looks like. The sharkskin is comprised of little denticles, and they overlap to create a diamond-shape repeating pattern on the sharkskin. Upon further investigation, Brennan and his team noticed that the texture on these denticles is actually what\'s responsible for keeping sharks clean. I\'m a microbiologist and infectious disease expert, and I find this fascinating. I\'ve spent my career trying to keep surfaces clean, especially the surfaces of medical devices. In hospitals this is a massive problem. See, what happens is bacteria who are really normally good find themselves in places they shouldn\'t be as a result of some medical procedure. Sometime during or after surgery, bacteria latch onto the surface of a medical device, stay there, and cause a serious infection; and this makes it impossible for the body to heal. Take a look at these surgical wires used to close a patient\'s sternum following open-heart surgery. Notice the tiny clusters of bacteria on the surface? This patient didn\'t heal for months until the wires were removed, and replaced with clean ones. You know, it used to be we just used antibiotics to treat these types of infections. Antibiotics were an amazing drug, for a while. But eventually, bacteria were exposed to antibiotics so frequently they were forced to adapt. And survival is the key driver of evolution, and that\'s what we\'re talking about here: bacterial evolution. Perhaps you\'ve heard about this in the news. It\'s referred to as ""Antimicrobial Resistance."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call antimicrobial resistance one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. Illnesses that were once easily treatable are now untreatable. In the US alone every year, more than two million people will get an antibiotic resistant infection, and over 23,000 people will die as a result of that infection. The pharmaceutical industry is rushing to develop more and more and more antimicrobials, desperately trying to outpace antimicrobial resistance. But bacteria and germs, they evolve so much more quickly than we could innovate ways to kill them. It\'s clear the antimicrobial era is coming to an end, so we have to think about this in a whole new way. What if instead of trying to kill bacteria after they cause infections, we simply make it harder for bacteria to stick to the surfaces of medical devices in the first place? In other words, we prevent these infections from occurring altogether. That\'s what brings me back to what we\'ve learned from sharks. It\'s the texture of sharkskin that makes them resistant to fouling. So what if we change the texture of medical devices to make them resistant to bacteria causing so many problems? Dr. Brennan knew he had a major medical breakthrough on his hands. He called up some trusted friends right here in Denver Colorado, and they started a company, and they called it Sharklet Technologies. In 2013, I joined the team, and together we used engineered surfaces mimicking the skin of sharks to prevent bacteria and other medical complications. Our first commercial device is a urological catheter, which doctors began using for patients just last year. (Applause) Take a look at these example images. The surface on the left is a smooth surface, and the one on the right is a sharkskin-like texture. Notice how much bacteria\'s on the smooth surface compared to the sharkskin-like surface? This is because the sharkskin-like texture creates an inhospitable surface for bacterial attachment and growth. It works on sharks, and it works here too because the texture takes advantage of principles of surface energy. Now, surface energy is really a description of a detailed property of a surface. It can include things like water interaction or material stiffness. The roughened sharkskin-like texture creates a surface with greater surface energy. You know, we interact with surface energy changes all the time. We often just don\'t notice it. For example, we like when rain beads up and runs off our car, right? Well, this happens best with a nice coat of wax. Wax is a material with greater surface energy characteristics. Now, we can\'t coat medical devices in wax, but we can change their surface texture. And this approach works on all types of medical devices, from catheters to pacemakers, and it\'s effective against all types of bacteria and germs. As it turns out, we can actually do more than just bacteria-proof medical devices. We can prevent other medical complications through understanding the power of surface energy, things like frequent clogging, excessive blood clotting or poor healing interactions. The next generation of medical device surfaces inspired by the skin of sharks will actually expand how medical devices are made. Really the core issue is that we create all types of sophisticated medical devices, things to pump fluid into our blood, keep our heart beating on pace, or even stimulate brain activity. But bad things happen when these devices don\'t interact well with our bodies\' natural mechanisms. We\'ve actually discovered that we can improve how medical devices are tolerated through subtly tuning the surface energy characteristics, like for example, we can prevent a lot of the excessive clotting that\'s occurring here on the smooth surface, compared to the sharkskin-like texture. This means that we can actually match the required surface energy with the medical use to prevent complications, all with the power of sharks. Ultimately, as we continue to engineer smart surfaces, we\'ll require fewer antimicrobials, fewer chemicals and fewer harsh additives, and this will make life-saving medical technology safer for all of us to use. This is innovation in its purest form, to be sure. But it\'s also a good reminder of just how important it is to observe the subtle cues in the raw mystery of the world around us. Thank you.

""What happened to her?"" ""Why is she in a wheelchair?"" I think, subconsciously, people are hoping that I will talk about it. That I say what it is, tell them about it, open up about it. But the truth is, I\'ve already had enough of it. I\'ve had enough of everyone asking me. I\'ve had enough of explaining it to everyone. So what I\'ve decided to do lately is to start making things up. Every time someone has asked what happened, I make up a completely different story. Like I was attacked by a shark, I jumped off a cliff and survived. Or one time, a little boy asked me what had happened, and, very dramatically, I look at him and say to him, ""I\'m just doing a social experiment to see how people react when confronted with a wheelchair."" Very surprised, he looks at me and says, ""No way. Really? Let me see. Stand up."" The experiment was completely ruined. (Laughter) I believe the problem is not that people are interested in knowing why I am in a wheelchair, that\'s just simply curiosity. I believe the problem is that they ask me about it before asking my name. For me, starting to use a wheelchair was like discovering a new world. A world that, in reality, was always there. Everyone sees it, but not everyone is familiar with it. For me, it was like a change of outlook, a change of routine. Just like any other big change that can occur in your life, whether it\'s, I don\'t know, having a kid, moving to another house, losing a loved one, or changing jobs, it\'s adapting to a new routine. I didn\'t stop doing things; I learned to do things differently. I believe - For me, it was like a change in perspective, really. I went from seeing the world from 5\' 7"" to seeing it from the average height of an 8-year-old kid. The whole world started to be at a different height too. Mirrors, most of all. In 99% of mirrors, the only thing I can see is my forehead. And I come up to here. (Laughter) I discovered that there are things that are made for people like me. When I started to use a wheelchair, I stopped using the women\'s bathroom. I started going to a third bathroom, that bathroom that\'s made for people like me. I stopped entering places where everyone else went in, because most times the main entrances are not accessible. And the entrances for people like me are around the corner, the side door, through the utility room or the garage. I discovered the power of a ramp. For me, accessibility literally means opportunity. Whether or not there is a ramp up on the other side of the street, for me, means whether I can or can\'t cross over. But we live in a world where sometimes not many such opportunities exist. I had to change schools once I started using a wheelchair: the school I\'d been attending my whole life had not been adapted in a way that would allow me to keep going to it. Also, one of the things I found the most difficult were the looks. When you\'re in a wheelchair and you go down the street, everyone is going to look at you. It\'s inevitable. You can\'t avoid someone noticing you went out today without combing your hair. You can\'t avoid not greeting someone that you don\'t feel like greeting. Everyone is going to look at you, or, on the other hand, avoid looking at you. But one of the things that still surprises me the most is that, sometimes, it\'s as if I feel the world is trying to save me. It\'s as if, subconsciously, I go down the street, and people give me saint cards. They invite me to pray to the saints. They recommend doctors. Or they feel the need to give me a message of support. Like, ""Everything\'s going to be fine,"" (Laughter) ""you can do it, if you really want to,"" (Laughter) or they congratulate my friends for being my friends. (Laughter) I don\'t get it. (Applause) I believe - Often I don\'t know how to react to these things because I know people indubitably do it with the best of intentions, But it makes me wonder what a wheelchair is associated with. What the big picture is. Yes, I am in a wheelchair, but ... I\'m fine. I\'m not worried about my life. I don\'t want anyone to come and save me. To me, one of the greatest ironies is that it doesn\'t matter where I am, what I\'m doing, whom I\'m with, whether I\'m in a nightclub dancing the cumbia, people look at me ... and think, ""Wow, what genius!"" (Laughter) ""Wow, what an inspiration!"" (Laughter) ""What an example!"" (Laughter) I could be a serial killer who kills people at night, but, to the world, I\'m an example. (Applause) And that makes me wonder: ""Why do people train, study, take such great pains to be someone in life?"" Better to buy a wheelchair; you become exemplary automatically. (Applause) Sometimes disability is like a taboo. Words are used to name that which is not named. When I sat myself in a wheelchair, automatically, to the world, I became a special person. I became an angel. I became a being of light. (Laughter) And I also came to have different capabilities. I\'ve never really understood these different capabilities, because, I don\'t want to disappoint them, but I can\'t fly. (Laughter) I don\'t have superpowers. I believe the only way I\'m differently abled to all of you is that I have a horn. (Horn) (Applause) I don\'t think any of you have a horn. A disability does not make you better or worse than anyone else. For me, getting used to a wheelchair was a process. A long process. But I always think that it would have been easier if I had met with an environment that had already been adapted, and for it not to have been me who had to adapt to the environment. Everything would have been easier if disability wasn\'t a taboo or a bad word. If people didn\'t think being in a wheelchair meant something was wrong. If being able to get a job, using a public convenience, or getting on a bus, did not have to be a privilege. Everything would be easier if people with disabilities could indeed be examples, could indeed be inspirations, but for their ideas, for their talents, for their passions; not for the mere fact that crossing the street is a challenge.

Sounds can be noise in one context and music in another. We can all tell when someone is speaking vs. when they\'re singing, but as Diana Deutsch discovered if you take a spoken sentence, pull out a phrase, repeat that phrase over and over and over again, it will begin to sound musical. Then, if you listen to the entire sentence again, it will sound as if the person bursts into song when he or she gets to the repeated part. But the sounds reaching your ear are the same in all of those cases; what\'s changed is your brain. How the brain turns sound into music remains one of the greatest mysteries of neuroscience. The vast majority of us love some kind of music; If you don\'t, you are very rare and scientists will want to study you. We call you a person with ""amusia"" - a cool new name. We don\'t all love the same music. Personally, I\'m not a huge fan of smooth jazz, and you might not like opera. This characteristic of music, the fact that it\'s universally loved, but highly subjective, has ensured that it continues to baffle us. We all need certain things to survive and reproduce: food, water, sex. Our minds have evolved in such a way that when we don\'t have those things, we seek them out. They become enjoyable; we call them ""biological reinforcers."" But music is just a bunch of sounds strung together, it doesn\'t provide us with the essential nutrients; it doesn\'t bind to our neurons the way drugs do; it doesn\'t ensure that our genes live on although that might be debatable. Why do we love music? It\'s a question I\'ve struggled to answer, and I can\'t promise you a full, complete solution today, but I like to share with you some of the scientific insights that had made me a better musician, and some of the artistic insights I hope will help neuroscientists solve this mystery. I come from a family of physicians: two anesthesiologists, a gastroenterologist, a generalist, an orthopedic surgeon, an ophthalmic surgeon, and an ER doctor. Thanksgiving dinner at our house is the safest place to be outside of the hospital. (Laughter) so I can\'t guarantee it\'s the most fun. Then there is my mother; she is a conductor, much to my two-year old son\'s dismay, not of the locomotive kind but very much of the music kind. Growing up, I saw how difficult it is to make a living as a musician in a society where music is universally loved but hopelessly undervalued. She works long hours, she still sacrifices every holiday, and there is a part of her that never stops wondering what people thought of her last performance. If you count up all the awards, the recognitions, and distinctions, she\'s by far, the most successful member of our family, but she certainly wouldn\'t think so. Not that being a doctor isn\'t stressful - it is - but at the end of the day, you\'ve spent your time trying to extend or enhance a person\'s life, and who can argue the value of that? So when it was my turn to decide what to do with my professional life, the choice seemed pretty straight forward: go to medical school, and in your free time, continue up your musical training. But then I watched my brother trained to become an orthopedic surgeon, and I realized there is no such thing as free time in med school and especially in the years that follow. I didn\'t want to give up the most important years of my vocal training. I also couldn\'t see how I could support myself and pay for those expensive singing lessons if I didn\'t have some other way to make money. So I turned to neuroscience. To me, it was the a perfect blend of science and poetry. Like pretty much every other neuroscientist of my generation, I devoured the writings of Oliver Sacks; I studied topics like autobiographical memory, analogical reasoning, creativity. So you\'d think then I\'d turn to science to help me become a better musician. After all, if I was using science to understand something as elusive as insight, wouldn\'t it make sense to turn there to learn the things that I loved? But the truth is the more I looked at anatomical drawings of the larynx, the tongue, and the diaphragm, the less I felt I understood about my instrument; I couldn\'t see how knowing what parts of the brain were active or even enhanced in musicians would make me sing better. For a while, I even tried very hard to give up singing, because, after all, there are so many great singers in the world. We all need to get one-on-one care from a physician, but many hundreds of thousands of us can be moved by the same musician. So wouldn\'t I, and maybe the world, be better off if I stuck to medical research? The problem was that the more time I let elapse between singing engagements, the more I felt there was something really important missing from my life. The more I felt that I couldn\'t be the person I needed to be, I became moody, irritable, a little irrational, often mean; and I found too often I would cap off a difficult day in the lab with a martini or two and an hour of self-loathing. So when I finished my neuroscience PhD, I decided to dedicate myself full time to music; I enrolled in a Master\'s of Music program. Classical musical training follows the apprenticeship model where you study with one or two teachers for many years until you can produce the sounds that you hear in your imagination on your instrument. But the one thing that kept gnawing at me over and over again was how little neuroscience had trickled down into this model. After all, most of the techniques are built upon performing the same exercises over and over and over again, often, in the same way, everyday; until you build those skills. To demonstrate this, I want to introduce to you one of my favorite collaborators, Keisuke Nakagoshi. (Applause) Keisuke is going to give us an example of what a typical piano training exercise sounds like. (Piano music starts) (Piano music ends) Over and over and over again! But the truth is if you want to take what you\'re learning, what you\'re developing in that skill, and apply it to any piece of music, research in motor learning suggests that you should in fact interleave and space out your trials introducing some randomness - what we call ""desirable difficulties."" There is even a study of pianists demonstrating this effect, but so many teachers have never heard of such a thing. So then I began to wonder, ""What would happen if I actually try it on myself?"" as most scientists use themselves as guinea pigs, and I found that I started to improve much more rapidly. So I developed a course called Training the Musical Brain; how to use neuroscience to develop more effective practice strategies which I now teach at the Conservatory of Music here in San Francisco. I started to wonder, ""Are there other ways that science can make me a better musician that I couldn\'t see ten years ago?"" When I was a child, I remember one of my evaluations at the Royal Conservatory of Music; it\'ll always stick with me. I was a kid, I sang all my pieces well, I didn\'t make any mistakes, the judges said my tone was very good, I had good technique, but my performance was deemed ""unmusical."" I was devastated. How could these judges gauge my musicality? Couldn\'t they see that I feel and understand this music deeply? But the truth is feeling the music and producing music other people feel are two different skills. In the rehearsal room, I can cry as much as I need to when my character is dying, but when I get on stage, it\'s your time to cry not mine. So what could science tell me about that? That\'s when my two worlds collided; because after all, art and science are after the same thing: the goal is to understand the human experience. Science does it by extracting general principles about the world, and art uses individual experience to highlight what\'s universal. So here is what I learned in a nutshell: your brain is primed to search for meaning, for patterns, in a random, chaotic world. We look for these things everywhere, and we\'ve evolved in such a way that it\'s enjoyable when we make a new connection, when we learn something new, when we understand something meaningful. We find pleasure in it. We see things that are meaningful to us even when they are not there. We see faces everywhere; they are important to us. We anthropomorphize or attribute human-like traits to our pets, or cars, or digital devices. When we hear repeated sounds, and we know what they mean, we call it music. Speech becomes song just by repetition. In fact, repetition is the one quality of music that seems to be common across all cultures and genres, even in the one genre in which it\'s explicitly avoided - we call this classical contemporary music composition."" Elizabeth Margulis found if you artificially insert repetition into these pieces, people find them more enjoyable, more interesting, more likely to be rated as having been composed by a human being rather than a computer. Why? Because repetition signals intention, it frames the pattern, it shows you that there is something meaningful here to listen to. But that\'s not enough to explain a human obsession. After all, music can cause riots, topple governments, raise the hairs on the back of your neck. What can science tell us about that? It turns out that when your brain is enjoying a piece of music that might even give you the chills, it\'s awash with a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine, despite its widespread fame, has actually been undersold in many ways; people think of it as the ""pleasure chemical,"" but that\'s not all it does. A better term for it is the ""salience chemical,"" because it\'s awash in some parts of your brain when you\'re trying to hold important things in mind, when you\'re nauseated, when you want something, when there is a meaning to be found. The way that dopamine\'s awash in the brain while you\'re getting the chills from music is very specific to when and where it happens. There\'s a paper from Robert Zatorre\'s lab at McGill with Valorie Salimpoor, the first author that documents these changes and showed me, finally, what it means to be musical. Even as a master\'s student, I self-doubted my ability to sing musically; it was a bit like being cool: everyone seemed to know what it was and how to do it, but if you even asked the question, it showed that you weren\'t cool. I guess the fact I turned to science for help puts the nail in the coffin of my coolness. (Laughter) Even though in the practice room, I\'d spend almost all my time perfecting my high notes, after all, that\'s what gets you hired. They come at the climax of the piece; they get the biggest reaction from the audience; and if you screw them up, they are the most memorable. But my singing teacher would say to me, ""It\'s all the notes that are leading up to the high note that are more important than the high note, and that\'s what you should practice."" I understood that from a technical perspective but not from a musical one until I read the Salimpoor paper. In the Salimpoor paper, they show that there are two regions of the brain that mediate getting the chills from music and they tracked dopamine in these regions. They are the caudate and the nucleus accumbens. You can think of the caudate as your parent: it tells you that your behavior has consequences, it tracks how the things that you see, hear, observe, and do have outcomes; it sets up the expectation of a reward of pleasure and ensures, in the future, you will behave in such a way that you will seek reward and avoid the things that led to punishment. The caudate is awash with dopamine when you are leading up to the special moment that will give you the chills. But when you get to the moment that give you the chills, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens. Your nucleus accumbens is your BFF, it\'s your best friend for life, because more dopamine in the nucleus accumbens correlates with a bigger high. In the 1950s, Olds and Milner stuck electrodes into the nucleus accumbens of a bunch of rats. Then, they taught those rats to press the lever; and every time they pressed the lever, they\'d get a little electric current that stimulates their nucleus accumbens. Those rats wanted nothing more than to press that lever. One rat pressed it 7,500 times in 12 hours, suggesting that it would starve rather than stop pressing. The nucleus accumbens likes, but the caudate wants. The intensity of the chills that you feel from music depends on how much dopamine there is in your nucleus accumbens, but the number of times you get the chills or, if you get them at all, depends on the amount of dopamine in your caudate. That\'s what I learned, that\'s what it means to be musical. You need to set up the musical intention for your audience so that they will pay attention, so that the caudate will know that there is a reward to be had, and we better pay attention. Then, as a musician, you use all kinds of tools, once you\'ve set up the tension, to delay it, to delay the release. There\'s all kinds of music tools you can use to increase the desire, the expectation, the motivation for the reward, because, after all, pleasure is the death of desire. But the more desire there is, the better the pleasure. That\'s what I learned. So let me demonstrate to you this little theory in practice. One of my favorite opera is ""La Traviata"" by Verdi. It tells the story of a Parisian courtesan, a high class prostitute, who is dying of tuberculosis, as lots of sopranos do. (Laughter) She is entertaining a lavish party because she\'s giving everybody pleasure. That\'s what she does for a living, she gives pleasure, and she gets exhausted by the party; but at the party, she meets this young man who has been sitting outside her window while she was ill, unable to give pleasure when all her friends had abandoned her, and he was waiting for her because he really loved her. And now, alone in her room, she wonders, ""What would it be like to feel true love?"" ""What is this mysterious thing, this pulse of the universe?"" She realizes that it\'s a double-edged sword, that love is both torture and delight, (Italian) ""croce e delizia."" That\'s the intention I want to communicate to you, musically, because, of course, the idea is much more complicated than we can say. In order to do that, I\'ll first sing a repeat of what the tenor\'s saying earlier in the act. Clever Verdi! We like things better the second time around; repetition. Then I will set up the expectation, I\'ll tell you straight off, there will be a high note - Setting that up? - but I will delay that high note as long as possible to increase your motivation to get dopamine into your caudates, so that by the time we relax that tension, there is a dopamine spike in your nucleus accumbens.
